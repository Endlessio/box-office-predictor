"The most powerful 60 seconds in cinematic history.
The deafening roar of silence."
"I'm going to be honest, I was skeptical of this movie from the start, but boy am I glad I was wrong. I have adored Mister Rogers since I was a young girl & I didn't like the idea of someone else playing him. But Tom Hanks truly embodied Fred's spirit & presence to the point where I almost forgot it wasn't Mister Rogers!This movie used so many small moments in big ways that were gut-wrenching & raw. It makes you feel seen & exposed in a way that is humbling. Mr. Rogers has always inspired me to grow & become the best version of myself possible & I'm ecstatic that A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood does his name justice. Truly a joy to behold."
This is the exact movie we all need to watch right now about forgiveness and compassion. I absolutely loved it. It was just so so good. Both Mathew and Tom both deserve Oscar recognition for their phenomenal performance. I truly recommend this movie for everyone. It makes you think about yourself.
This movie was honestly near perfection. The acting from everyone involved was amazing. Tom Hanks was born to play Mr Rogers. The emotional moments were perfect. This movie came out at the exact right time in our society. This is the exact movie we all need to watch right now about forgiveness and compassion. I absolutely loved it. It was just so so good. Both Mathew and Tom both deserve Oscar recognition for their phenomenal performance. I truly recommend this movie for everyone. It makes you think about yourself.
"A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood is a beautiful feel-good film about Mr. Rogers and the effect he had and will always have on people. It tells the tale of his relationship with Lloyd Vogel (Matthew Rhys), an emotionally jaded reporter tasked to write a profile on him as one of America's heroes (based on the real life story of Tom Junod's relationship with Mr. Rogers).Tom Hanks absolutely shines as he transforms into the beloved children's show star in a role his career has been perhaps always leading to. Hanks embodies all that is Fred Rogers, from his delicate mannerism to beautifully authentic warmth with others. Hanks pulls at your heartstrings with every word uttered during the film's run.Tom Hanks, however, is not the only actor to be lauded for his performance, as co-stars Matthew Rhys (Lloyd Vogel) and Chris Cooper (Jerry Vogel) deliver outstanding ones in their own right. The father-son struggle presented in the film allows for each actor to flush out raw emotion that transcends with the audience. Rhys and Hanks too have this tremendous chemistry that has each actor radiating in the scenes they share.The film brings back many aspects of nostalgia for viewers of the original show as Hanks and company perfectly recreate iconic scenes and moments. The film also does an excellent job intercutting from the show's original 4:3 aspect ratio and 2 camera set up to modern film production. This allows for these scenes to have a unique presentation as we jump from Mr. Rogers' neighborhood to the film. Director Marielle Heller (Can You Ever Forgive Me? (2018)) and writing duo Micah Fitzerman-Blue and Noah Harpster work meticulously to bring Mr. Rogers' world to life, allowing for the film to feel authentic in each and every way.This film is about Mr. Rogers' impact on one person's life on its surface. However, looking slightly beyond unveils much more in that it is a look at the human condition and Mr. Rogers' exceptional understanding of it. It explains the importance people have in each other's lives and how much we depend on one another, something Mr. Rogers very much understood and exemplified in his life's work. Sometimes you need Mr. Rogers to explain it to you as he always finds a way to make it easy to understand and feel better about. The world could do with more Mr. Rogers and this film shows us just exactly why."
"A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood is a superb film and one of the most wonderful movie going experiences of my life. Mr. Tom Hanks gives what is nothing less than the performance of a lifetime. Simply incredible. Subtly and with artistry and sensitivity Mr. Hanks becomes Fred Rogers and it's as if the actor himself disappears. Beautifully written and wonderfully directed, this is a motion picture that will live in the hearts of audiences for generations to come. Tom Hanks will rip your heart out and return it to you filled with love and understanding. This is an historic acting accomplishment in a film that will become an instant classic."
"I just saw this wonderful movie on opening night, a film based on the true life friendship Fred Rogers had with reporter Tom Junrod (called Lloyd Vogel in the film) and his family, and how their relationship changed Junrod's outlook on life.What a powerful, beautiful, moving, and heartfelt film! I'm not ashamed to admit that it actually did move me to tears, and happy tears at that. Tom Hanks shines as the kindly ordained minister turned children's show host! Possibly not since Forrest Gump has Tom Hanks delivered a finer performance.
This is a film that we all need right now. It's a movie that spreads further Mister Roger's message of self love, love for others, and the power of forgiveness. It really leaves you wanting to be a better person.The film also highlights how Fred Rogers' faith in Jesus Christ let him be a shining light to everyone. Not just children either. He truly was a servant of Christ, and the film honors that and highlights just how big of an impact he had on others. He truly cared for everyone.
This is a superb piece of cinema that everyone should see. I can't tell you how much I enjoyed this film! Excellent job done by everyone involved! I really loved it!!"
I.......I don't have any words. I love this movie. I.....I just don't know what to say. I never thought this movie makes me want to be like Mr. Rogers.This film is just beautiful. This film makes me want to cry. He was a man who was nothing but pure heart. I saw his TV shows and all of them are beautiful. I cried about everything in this movie. I just couldn't stop crying. I love the fact that Tom Hanks did nothing but a phenomenal job doing Fred Rogers. Everything about this movie I had no complains. This movie makes ME FEEL something.....HAPPINESS. I LOVE this movie. I don't know what to say this movie was made for Mr. Rogers himself. Please go watch this movie. Please give this money so the studio can do more movies like this. The Director needs to do more movies like this. Even if you saw it already see it again. This movie is beautiful. Please. Support a movie like this. Please I LOVE THIS movie near dear to my heart. I never cared about watching action movies or cared about racing or people with powers. I care about people being PEOPLE. I hope Mr Rogers watches this in heaven and not only appreciate it. But will say that was what the neighborhood made for me. (Trust me I think he will be more than just proud). 10/10
"It's about a lifetime of work. It's about making choices. The definition of a saint is well known, and Fred Rogers should be your guidepost."
"It's definitely A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood when Tom Hanks portrays the iconic Mister Rogers. The message is timely and needed now more than ever. This movie is not what I expected. You learn about Mr. Rogers' through his relationship with a man who didn't want to be his friend or neighbor. It's a message that we all need to hear.A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood is based on a true life story about the relationship that develops between Fred Rogers and a cynical reporter who is loath to interview him for a piece on American heroes. In the movie, the reporter is Lloyd Vogel (Matthew Rhys) who gives an amazing performance. Through his interactions with Fred Rogers (Tom Hanks), Vogel begins to understand that part of him is broken. The healing process begins as their friendship develops and you see Fred Rogers teaching him to understand, accept and voice his emotions and feelings. It is beautiful. Tom Hanks is masterful in this role at bringing out the transformation of his friend.In addition to Tom Hanks and Matthew Rhys, the cast has other powerful performances, notably Chris Cooper who plays Lloyd's dad, Jerry Vogel. Christine Lahti, as Lloyd's Editor Ellen, pushes him to work on the hero piece and adds a touching element to the movie as well. The film is directed by Marielle Heller and written by Micah Fitzerman-Blue and Noah Harpster. Music plays an important role in this movie and is by Nate Heller. The scenes of Mr. Rogers playing the piano along with the behind-the-scenes of the television show during filming of Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood are particularly moving.The message of this film is that anyone can change the world with words. It's a powerful message that we often forget. Listen and think before you speak, as your words impact others. Fred Rogers finds a positive way to help others express their feelings, which is not an easy thing to do, although he makes it look easy. Forgiveness and redemption are another theme in this film.I rate this film 4.5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 4 to 18 and adults will love it as well.Reviewed by Selene W., KIDS FIRST!

"To state the obvious, nobody (not even Tom Hanks) can fill the shoes of Mister Rogers, and as other have stated, it takes a bit for my mind to make that switch. Especially since I have a two year old son, so we watch Mister Rogers Neighborhood on the daily, making it even more glaringly obvious of how different Tom Hanks acts and looks, he does great though considering the unique role he's set to fill.
I do highly recommend the documentary and the biography ""The Good Neighbor"" for those more interested in the life of Mister Rogers, but this film is important in showing just how impactful this man was (and how his legacy still is). He was an original man with original perspectives and this movie shows the transition from ""he's just too good to be true"" to ""he REALLY was this good, and really was this true"". People don't like it because it wasn't what they expect, but maybe just look at it how Mister Rogers would ;)"
"At the Chinese restaurant in Fred Rogers' beloved Pittsburgh, suffering Lloyd Vogel, played by Matthew Rhys, gets why Mister Rogers likes people like him: He's ""broken"". Tom Hanks's Fred looks in Lloyd's eyes, ""You're not broken."" He invites Lloyd to think about the ones, who ""loved you into existence"".That's the touching humanity of Director Marielle Heller's ""A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood"". Yes, the movie isn't perfect. Yet, much like Mister Rogers, it sources from a good space: The power of forgiveness, the power of kindness.Micah Fitzerman-Blue and Noah Harpster's screenplay is based the friendship of Fred Roger (""Mister Rogers' Neighborhood"") and Writer Tom Junod. Tom wrote his Esquire article in 1998 that inspired the narrative. At times, ""A Beautiful Day"" occurs as nearly allegory, almost fable.Micah and Noah's narrative surprise: Fred Rogers isn't the conceit. Rather, it's Lloyd's journey. That seems the catharsis of real-life writer Tom Junod. When distraught Lloyd appears in ""Neighborhood of Make-Believe"" that's indulgent disbelief. That can be forgiven, as well.Throughout, Tom Hank's poignantly authentic performance as Fred Rogers inspires. Occasionally, Matthew Rhys's relentless anger get wearisome. Yet, Tom's quiet empathy reminds that Lloyd suffers in his unwillingness to just let go.The movie opens with Mister Rogers in his beloved red sweater asking children at home, ""Do you know what forgive means?"" That lands. Back when I was one of those kids watching ""Mister Rogers'"", I felt that he was talking to me. He listened. He actually got me.""A Beautiful Day"" works in Tom's powerful listening, and his authentic vulnerability. Solid Maryann Plunkett as Fred's wife Joanne tells Lloyd that Fred ""is not perfect"". He doesn't want to be a saint, because that would make him ""unattainable"". Cynical Lloyd gets that Fred is someone to aspire to be.Award winning writer Lloyd is a new father. His understanding wife Andrea, played by smart strong Susan Kelechi Watson, forsakes her career to be the stay-at-home Mom.Lloyd and Andrea attend his sister Lorraine's wedding. Lorraine is played by comically aloof Tammy Blanchard. Lorraine invites their estranged jerk-like Father Jerry, played by believable self-righteous Chris Cooper. The two brawl at the wedding, apparently over Lloyd's late Mother.Meanwhile, Lloyd, who has the reputation for demonizing interviews, is given an assignment by his Editor Ellen, played by beautiful edgy Christine Lahti. Esquire Magazine is doing a series on American Heroes. Lloyd's assignment: Fred Rogers. Even Andrea warns, ""... Please don't ruin my childhood.""Lloyd looks to reveal Fred's darker side. After all, no one can be that good? When they do meet: who is interviewing who? Fred admits he wasn't the best Father to his two sons. He quickly discerns Lloyd's profound suffering. Lloyd tells of the fight with his Father. Fred sighs, ""Oh, my..."" Tom's visceral well of compassion defines ""A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood"" as something special.""A Beautiful Day"" is about letting go of the anger that hides our fear. Forgive others as we forgive ourselves. Much like watching ""Mister Rogers' Neighborhood"" back when I was 6 years old, there's a lesson. Tom's Fred thoughtfully speaks about the nature of death. He says, ""Anything mentionable is manageable."" Amen.""A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood"" might not be perfect, which it never intends to be. Yet, it speaks to the power of forgiveness, the power of kindness. Forgiveness and kindness are the enduring legacy of Fred Rogers. Just saying."
"This has been the big surprise of TIFF for me thus far. I was not expecting a richly textured character study that explores emotional trauma and forgiveness. The movie is really about the Matthew Rhys character, and Fred Rogers serves as an 'antagonist' of sorts. Heller avoids the usual traps of biopics by limiting scope, focusing on humanity, and elevating material with creative strokes (animation, music, surreal dream + memory sequences).There is also some underlying meta commentary on Tom Hanks career and what he means to present society, including a scene talking about Fred's puppets that couldve been Andy in Toy Story talking about Woody. I hope somebody writes that think piece."
"... but it is better. Instead of a straight documentary, it is one of many examples (I'm sure) of what kind of a person Fred Rogers really was. A picture may paint a thousand words, but this true life story conveys the true heart behind the man. It does not just tell you how great he was, it lets you experience it. The film and the man are treasures!"
"This could so easily have been sentimental Hollywood pap about settling family feuds. Instead, it's a thoughtful, textured contemplation of how we can effectively deal with our expectations, disappointments and imperfections. It is true, as others have pointed out, that the female roles are ciphers, which might be considered a surprising weakness in a film directed by a woman. Nonetheless, Marielle Heller, who did such an excellent job on CAN YOU EVER FORGIVE ME? also steers this movie superbly, handling the performances and the screenplay's playful shifts of tone with great assurance.The central trio -- Tom Hanks, Matthew Rhys and Chris Cooper -- are reliably terrific."
"Just caught an advance screening. This movie is not what I was expecting, and I mean that in a good way.We all knew Tom Hanks was going to be amazing as Mr. Rogers, but it's the rest of the story that carries the weight.Wonderfully acted and directed, this movie is a must-see."
"I find myself a bit conflicted about my feelings on ""a beautiful day in the neighborhood"" without using the word , disingenuous. It seems to be advertising it self as the Mr. Roger's movie , having him on the poster , the title a reference to him , and almost all the ads Hank's performance. The truth is it's more about the effect Mr. Roger's had on people (and still does) then a straight biopic. In fact Mr. Roger's is on screen for maybe less then half its run time . But , to be honest, it's ok. It's a very unique and intriguing story and I really enjoyed watching it. It just leaves you wanting more of its greatest moments : the recreation of sets, the transitions between scenes and of course Tom Hanks amazing performance. He truly becomes Fred Roger's , right down to body ticks and glares . Every moment he's on screen joy came across my face and I was whisked back to my childhood .
Unfortunately, something just feels forced about the other half , emotion just doesn't connect the way it should and some scenes feel out of place and oddly humorous. One such scene , a trippy nightmare , sticks out like a sore thumb . Sometimes things feel forced in as Mr. Roger's greatest hits then actual moments from the main characters encounters and they're extremely noticeable and out of place . All of this just doesn't gel into a cohesive piece like it should. You will find , however, a great message that really makes you feel inspired. I guess that's more Mr. Roger's then I give it credit for."
"Just like red wine, travel insurance, and back hair, Mr. Rogers grew on me as I got older. I felt the story was executed perfectly and I'm sure glad Tom Hanks was picked to play Fred. Not long into the film, I stopped seeing Mr. Hanks and started seeing Mr. Rogers, which is what an iconic actor and great director will do when given the chance. The story itself, with Lloyd Vogel's involvement, was a unique delivery that I enjoyed. I laughed a few more times than I expected and maybe my man-harmones were out of joint but I was a tad bit emotional at one point as well. From the start the movie sent me down a street of nostalgia and that alone was worth it. Mr. Rogers stirred up so many memories of my youth as I watched, connecting me to the film even more than I would have thought. I hope you all enjoy it, and make sure to pound back some popcorn while you smile for 100 minutes."
"Tom Hanks after being denied an Oscar nod and the Academy would not be bright to deny him again is nearly perfect as the first actor to portray the late Fred Rogers.In what you see is what you get as a jaded journalist played by the Americans Matthew Rhys a newborn father who is bitter over his father estrangement and leaving him and his sister, who just got married in the film.But when asked to do something as he is an investigative journalist and not an entertainment writer he reluctantly agrees. But Lloyd his name, tries to spot a phony but there is nothing at all with Mr Rogers as he is the same way on TV as he was in real life.Sure the production company that work for him could get bothered in the taking time out of his day to help sick children. But in the end, he is what the wold needed.Died way too soon in 2003 over cancer but this gentle mild mannered man who did not like to really talk about himself gave it his all.BTW don't expect a biography about Mr Rogers himself. As Floyd is really the main protagonist and it is seen through his eyes.It is a movie that a little kindness goes a very long way!"
"6 outta 10 - Just okay, maybe see.I disagree with critics and majority of people that this was a great film. Feels more like a PBS acid trip, than a careful exploration of what it means to be a real hero. Tom Hanks is great, but is barely in the film, much like Hannibal Lector in Silence of the Lambs we eagerly await his every witty quip or anecdote & wish for his next scene only to realize he is more a plot device than a flesh and blood character. Yet, the film keeps telling you he is not perfect, keeps hinting there is more to know, but coldly stops and gets lost in a much much less interesting story of someone whom he helps. Replace Mr Rogers with any wise-figure (Santa Claus for example) and little would change... very small efforts are made to give Mr Rogers enough time to develop himself more than what we can figure out from watching him on tv. We're supposed to just accept he really was a nice guy (which I don't doubt) and never supposed to ask for a full backstory. The film even muses how the article being written (and by association, the film which is based on it) isn't even about Mr Rogers... as if they delight you've been fooled. I'd be fine with this if any other character was remotely believable (and it's based on a true story... so you know they are real). Instead this $50M film feels super cheaply made (except for A List Tom Hanks). Every character says exactly what they mean every second of the time, having zero depth or nuance and are painted in broad strokes, despite the Mr Rogers character being one of the most intriguing real people ever on television. Eventually the plot just gives up and gets stuck in the gimmick of this being just another episode of Mr Rogers, having Hanks talk to the camera as the real guy did. It's cute at first, but once you realize the entire film will keep going back to this, doesn't have the staying power or the lack of distraction as Forrest Gump's storytelling narrator had. Hanks tries, but the whole niche feels clichè and hackneyed. There are some genuine good moments in the film... a death bed scene, a couple of good moments with Rogers (most of which are in the trailer). I still think it's best to skip this and watch the hit documentary Won't you Be My Neighbor, made last year on a micro budget. It had me in tears. This one, had me looking at my watch as the two hour Rogers episode kept up the gimmick. Sorry, didn't like it."
"My heart is full and I felt like I was a kid at my grandparents house watching PBS.
Obviously, Mr. Rodgers can never be fully replicated, but Tom Hanks captures him so well from the mannerisms to the small pauses. The acting is incredible. This film honors Mr. Rodgers and will tell an amazing story to those that might not know who he was."
"Let's just lay these bones bare: it's not that 'A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood' is a particularly bad movie, it's just that it's unnecessary.For those of us who live online-which is most of us, honestly-we all know that people like Fred Rogers and Bob Ross have seen a resurgence in their popularity lately due to their wholesome nature and have subsequently been canonized for sainthood by the online community.Partly as a result, director Morgan Neville began assembling the Fred Rogers documentary 'Won't You Be My Neighbor' well ahead of the film's 2018 release. It played at Sundance on January 19th. On January 29th, it was announced that TriStar Pictures had bought the worldwide distribution rights for the source material that would eventually become 'A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood.' See what we're getting at?So 'A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood' is essentially redundant and as is the case with any facsimile, the quality just isn't as sharp. Our recommendation? Save your money and stream 'Won't You Be My Neighbor' instead."
This movie shows what a real superhero is actually like.
"I was deeply moved by this movie. It brought realizations to me that were incredibly deep. I was moved to tears more than once. The pace of the movie was a little slow, but fitting. By sharp contrast to some of the dud movies this year like the Angels one for example, this movie actually was true to life and left you with a great takeaway. We need more movies like this!!!!!! I'm so sick of the shallow empty meaningless load of tripe that Hollywood endlessly churns out. Every once in a while, they get it right. This movie was excellent!"
I really tried to like this one but the pacing killed this movie. Did anyone else hate Lloyd as much as me?
"Great great movie. Hanks became Mr Rogers in a breathtaking way. The problem was, the film wasn't about Mr Rogers. It was about the man who interviewed him and drew inspiration from his message and spirit. This film could have been so so much more if it was about the trials and triumphs of Mr Rogers, his history, his flaws and how they helped him nurture his virtues. You didn't really learn anything about the man, however. His wife was written into a few scenes; I bet she was an intriguing woman as well. You never got to know her either. This film was pretty much about a writer who was having a rough time finding himself. He stumbles upon growth after meeting and becoming inspired by Roger's deliberate and unassuming character.
I'm happy I saw this, it made me want to find a book written by Rogers to learn about this man with the weird puppets, who seems more inspiring to me than Gandhi-- who is someone who has always inspired and impressed me.
So... see it! It's good movie that will make you feel light inside. However, Phoenix still gets the best actor award for 2019 in my book, where it could have been hank had he had more screen time."
Despite what the description says this is not a true story. Despite what the marketing implies it is not about Mister Rogers. This film is a fictional family melodrama that turns Mister Rogers into a would be therapist for a man named Lloyd Vogel (Said to be based on Tom Junod though the two have almost nothing in common). This is a movie that proves filmmakers felt they couldn't make an interesting story out of the life of Fred Rogers so they had to inject it with yet another cliche family drama about yet another man with daddy issues. I am fine with movies taking some dramatic license it is almost expected but this ratio of fact to fiction is about 10% fact and 90% fiction. Tom Hanks and the cute little scene transitions are the only thing that elevate this movie and make it even remotely worth watching.
"It's exactly as I expected, no better or no worse. Looks to be a lock for another best actor Oscar for TH."
"I caught a late night showing of this beautiful film about Mr. Rogers last night, and the first thing I have to say is that I was blown away. Reading that it was PG-rated and contained some language as well as a bit of violence, I thought ""Uh-oh, here goes Hollywood again, throwing in unnecessary crap to a movie about one of the kindest people who ever lived. Gosh, can't they skip that for once?"" It turned out I was entirely wrong in this thinking. I knew from the trailers that it would be pretty good, I had read about the fact it was more about the journalist Lloyd Vogel, and I was ready for an eight-star film. Instead, ""A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood"" exceeded my expectations so over the mark and gave me so much more than I initially thought, that it is truly an outstanding work.Let me explain my review title. Lots of people who have already seen this and reviewed have said several times ""I was expecting this to be a biopic about Mr. Rogers, but instead it got more into the journalist's story than his. Hanks doesn't get enough screen time..."" What these people don't see is that if this was about Rogers's life, it wouldn't be impacting in any way, just an exploration into the man as a person. What the real goal of this film was from the beginning was to show Rogers's impact on other people, how he cares and loves for others, how he deals with feelings, and above all, how he teaches them about forgiveness. In the literal sense, the film really is more about Vogel than the beloved children's host. In the figurative sense, it really does center around Mr. Rogers in a way that is hard to explain. To get how, you would have to see it yourself; but those who criticize this as not being a biopic don't get that being a biopic was not the film's goal.Because the negatives are very few and far between, I'll address those first. Number one, the biggest problem: the guy who played Mr. McFeeley did a bad job. Sorry Daniel Krell, but you just did not do it. Physically, Krell was fine as an onscreen appearance, but when it came to carrying off the energetic charm of his character, he flopped miserably. Mr. McFeeley was always a happy, joyful character when appearing on the show; this guy looked like he was having a mini-seizure whilst being on drugs. It didn't help that the interaction between him and Hanks was awkward because the script wasn't at its finest there: literally, McFeeley comes through the door, and says ""Hey, uh, I, uh, have a magazine. I don't know how to start this conversation better, so I'll just jump right into it."" Thankfully, this scene lasts no longer than a minute, and McFeeley is out of the picture after that.One other thing: Hanks, when voicing Daniel Tiger and singing for him, struggles with those high notes. He probably couldn't do any better, so that's just a small gripe that hardly subtracts anything from the film as a whole. Also, get rid of the language. I know it's a broken family, but this is about Mr. Rogers! You do not need to be that realistic. At least it didn't get any worse and remained fairly infrequent throughout the film.Now come the positives, which are numerous. So many good things to say. Number one, the filmmakers could have chosen no better way to relate the story than to have Mr. Rogers on his normal program in his television house, showing us a picture of Lloyd and talking about him to start the story off. And then continuing the story when Mr. McFeeley arrives with a tape about how people make magazines (titled ""How People Make Magazines"", lol), which leads into how Vogel gets his assignment to interview the icon. The way it ends, with Rogers playing one of his own pieces on the piano, then cutting to the end credits and even including a bit of archive footage of the real Mr. Rogers himself, is beautiful.The acting is spot-on. From the beginning, I knew that people wouldn't like this because Tom Hanks wouldn't look EXACTLY like his role. These people are perfectionists. It's hard to make a film about a dead, famous icon that everybody knows and loves so well, but this did the best possible job in every sense. Hanks may not sound like Rogers or look like him, but he carried off the part perfectly; they could have chosen no better actor. Of course, some of this goes to the script fitting the television host's character excellently. The way Hanks talks to the viewer about forgiving people and about how Vogel got abused on the inside is so reminiscent of the TV show's scripts that it's eerie. Matthew Rhys didn't have such a demanding role to play, but he excels every bit as well in playing such a confused, messed-up person. The rest of the cast, likewise, is very good.Another thing that struck me: the dream sequences. I will not give those away, but they were both humorous and dramatic. I could feel Vogel's emotions as Mr. Rogers brings the confused journalist onto set to talk about hospitals, and this is where the dramatic elements of the movie come into play very well. In a Hollywood-type way yes, but done right to where we can sympathize with the protagonist. Sure it's overblown, but in a good way.Finally, the religious aspect. I didn't think they'd have the guts to do this, but they actually provided some insight into Rogers religious life by showing him first praying for all of his friends at his bedside at night, then swimming in the morning at the pool. Being a Christian, this may be important only to me, but it certainly surprised me that they did that. I'm glad they could throw in a few religious sentiments without annoying non-Christians; it was a really important scene without some realizing it.I could go on, but need I say more? The bottom line is, this movie has such a great message, provides such an accurate portrayal of the central character(s), and tells its story in such a distinct way that it exceeds all expectations, as it certainly did mine. If you know Mr. Rogers and have seen the show, it's especially beautiful. I completely recommend it to anyone; a masterpiece."
8/10 - a heartfelt love letter to the incomparable Mr. Rogers makes for nice cinema
"A beautiful day in the neighborhood is not what I was expecting it to be. Tom Hanks shines like always, but the film itself flopped."
Another tom hanks master piece looking so true did look up past this rogers famous for children
"Honestly for me a beautiful day in the neighborhood is mediocore as a film and if i have to choose i would rather watch documentry that come out last year over this but saving grace as we all expected was tom hanks as fred rogers who kills it with this role you could even say that he was even better at playing fred rogers then fred rogers himself,every scene hanks sold it with his likebelite and charisma ,and he gets a nomination for awards it wont be undeserved"
Tom Hanks was awesome and Fred Rogers is the best. But I can't understand why they created such a despicable back story for the writer and his father. The father leaves behind two kids to fend on their own after their mother dies because he is off philandering. My guess is Fred would have advised the writer to forgive but not to go back to the father. After reading the actual article they easily could have done a biopic just on those engagements written in the article.
This movie had so many profound moments. I was brought to tears more than once.
"We went to the late showing of this last night.It left us profoundly moved. Its powerful message (without being ""messagey"") lingers strongly afterward.Despite what seems to be promoted in its trailer, it is not in spirit a recreated episode of Mister Rogers' Neighborhood, though the show is used - brilliantly - as a framing device to tell its story.Esquire journalist Lloyd Vogel, a glum, deeply unhappy man, is assigned - ordered - by his boss to write a piece about Fred Rogers, with a ""hero"" angle. The character of Vogel is loosely based on real-life journalist Tom Junod.Lloyd, whose writing is permeated by his own negativity, is resistant, discomfited, and extremely wary of Rogers' deep-seated, genuine goodness. Lloyd tries, via research and old video tapes, to find some contradictory evidence of Rogers as a counterpoint, but can't; the writer is completely flummoxed as to how to *present* the iconic man and children's TV personality as separate entities. He finds that there is no gap; Mister Rogers is Mister Rogers, on and off the screen.Instead, Rogers, sincerely and without any cunning maneuvers, fairly turns the tables on the recalcitrant and fearful Vogel; the writer finds he can't escape the keen instincts of his subject, and is forced to face his own demons and tormented family history.It is Mister Rogers' kindness that transforms Lloyd. And everyone else.Tom Hanks adds yet another indelible characterization to his sizable gallery of defining portrayals. I would hazard that playing Fred Rogers must have been perhaps Hanks' most difficult assignment. Mister Rogers is so definitive a man, a personality, a law unto himself, that it is well-nigh seemingly impossible to even imagine that he can accurately be replicated by anyone else; he is really not reproduceable. An actor would have to be, himself, ideally, of sterling character, but yet having the technique and range to depict the most guileless sincerity and goodness without a hint of smarminess or calculation.Hanks achieves this remarkable feat, and how. He is the perfect actor for playing Mister Rogers, and the performance is just about flawless.Equally effective is Matthew Rhys as Vogel. Rhys' Lloyd conveys a man of deep depression and unhappiness; he looks unwell, mentally sick, and anger, suspicion, and contempt for humanity oozes out of his very being. Trauma and resentment has left Lloyd appearing visibly spent and exhausted by life. Rhys announces himself as an outstanding actor in this performance.Chris Cooper turns in another of his formidable characterizations as Lloyd's terrible father.The rest of the cast does their part.Marielle Heller, the director, handles this with keen, absolute certainty, and makes sure that no false sentimentality compromises the proceedings; it is a skillful, and imaginative job on her part. This is, somewhat unexpectedly, a rather intense, occasionally very dark movie that confronts familiar, universal themes of family and interpersonal dysfunction: but also, very credibly, about redemption - and complete forgiveness.It may even foster healing for some. Sadly, it also may not.Humans are complicated, frustrating beings.But making choices, seeking out chances for healing remain open possibilities.The movie is a winner."
One of the heart touching movies I've seen in a while.
"First of all, the trailers and posters might have you believe this film is mainly about Mr. Rogers but no it isn't. The movie mainly follows Lloyd and what's going on in his personal life and I really enjoyed it. Do I wish that the advertisements were more accurate to the actual movie topic sure but I understand their decision on why because of money. But honestly it was an interesting story to watch and I enjoyed it. This is also helped by everybody in this movie giving it their all. I'm too young to have watched the actual show growing up but I have seen clips from it and Tom Hanks just does an incredible job as always and I really hope he at least gets an Oscar nomination for best-supporting actor. I mean he pretty much embodied Mr. Rogers and his mannerisms and it makes for an amazing performance. Matthew Rhys does an amazing job as Lloyd. Every time you saw them on screen together it was glorious because you can see how different they are but how they are also helping each other. This movie was well directed, Marielle Heller, and shot. There were so many shots in this movie that I just thought to myself we need more of this in the world. There is one scene that I feel like everybody needs to check out and do at least once in their life. I did enjoy how it was filmed as if it was his show and we were just watching an hour forty-nine-minute long episode. The score by Nate Heller is an excellent one. In the end, A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood is a movie that we need in this day and age and no matter how old you are I think everybody should check out this movie at least once."
"The complete opposite of Joker, it makes you feel like a better person rather than a worse one. Tom Hanks is perfect. Great."
This was not at all what I expected. It was better. Take tissues.
"This was not a poorly made film at all, but it felt very Oscar bait-ish, and cliched. It has a good message and the acting was good especially from Tom Hanks, but the story was pretty misleading in the trailers. This isn't really a Mr. Rogers biopic like the trailers make it out to be, it's really a story about a journalist, who is a terrible person. And he meets Mr. Rogers and goes through a very forced and contrived transformation, he's the main character and he wasn't very well developed. The directing and writing were pretty meh. This film will get a lot of undeserved award recognition from the Oscars, which is a shame because there are so many other films this year that are better. Not to mention the documentary about Mr. Rogers from last year, Won't You Be My Neighbor (2018), was fantastic and is better than this film in every way."
"A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood turned out to be a much different movie than I was expecting, but I really enjoyed it. It moved me nearly to tears a number of times.It wasn't about the life of Fred Rogers. We don't really learn what made him the man he was. But it does tell us a lot about his worldview and how he cared for people. The movie does a lot to honor what Fred cared most about.The story is about the life struggles, past and present, of the journalist Mr. Rogers befriends. Mr. Rogers enters his life and helps him to heal.The acting is great, but it did take me 10 or 15 minutes to get from ""Tom Hanks trying to act like Mr. Rogers"" to believing he is Mr. Rogers. And once my mind made that switch, it was awesome."
"The movie has a good message to it and the writing was very good even if it felt a little slow at times, Tom Hanks is good but felt a little creepy at times. It's a good inspirational movie but something felt missing."
"I like Tom Hanks, I like Mr. Rogers. I don't like Tom Hanks as Mr. Rogers. Mr. Rogers spoke deliberately, but was still lively and peppy. The Tom Hanks version, was more like someone talking and reacting to Nyquil. The cadence of Mr. Hanks, does not match the Mr. Rogers I grew up with, The second distraction, was the movie concentrated on the life of another man, that at first, had very little regard for Mr. Rogers. I understand that the overall storyline was, Mr. Rogers changed the lives of those he met, personally or through a television. A biography would have been an appropriate vehicle for the life of this simple but complex man. The move did have its high points, such as Fred Rogers getting into the character of his puppets, his humility and accessibility, even if it conflicted with the time table of his producers. Overall an OK movie, but the 2018 Won't You Be My Neighbor? was a much better film, that left the movie goers, in our theater teary eyed."
"I went into the theatre expecting more of a biography than a melodramatic piece.Say what you will, but I felt Hanks' performance of Mr. Rogers was what saved this film from being a utter flop. With that said, Mr. Rogers feels like a secondary character in the plot, which gets increasingly predictable and cliché by the latter part of the film.The film starts off with a seemingly unexpected plot twist, which honestly grabbed my attention. About halfway through, aside from a few stellar scenes with Hanks, the storyline seemed to diverge farther into an exaggerated and overly predictable ""feel good"" drama.The pacing was also too jumpy for me. Just when you thought you'd actually learn something deep about Fred Rogers, the movie cut away to the ""real"" plot that had more to do with the investigative journalist, than Fred Rogers as a man.Let me be clear, the pacing was not bad when it got slow. It was so slow at times that it almost made you uncomfortable, but that's because Hanks nailed Mr. Rogers. If you never watched him in the 90s or earlier, I could see how you might be thrown off with just how slow and abnormal his character comes off as. Unfortunately, the slow pacing is offset erratically by the dramatic acting that comes off as borderline forced by the journalist's family.Overall, the unexpected start to the film grabbed my attention, Hanks performance during the first half kept me interested, but I almost got up and left the theatre in the second half when the plot became uninterestingly predictable and Hanks screen-time lessened.6/10 because Hanks gave a strong performance, but without him it would have been maybe a 3 or 4 at best."
"Saw it on Thanksgiving with my sister. We both felt it was like watching a Twilight Zone version of Mr. Rogers. It was the very definition of Bizarre. We're both huge Tom Hanks fans, and Fred Rogers melts our hearts, and we couldn't wait to see this film. We knew it was more about Lloyd Vogel than Fred Rogers, but that wasn't the problem, it was how they portrayed Mr. Rogers, and Lloyd wrapped up in some bizarro universe. We couldn't believe that Mr. Rogers' family saw it, and then said, yeah, looks good, go ahead and release it to the public. The one minute of silence in the cafe -- the look on Tom's face -- cue the Twilight Zone theme song. Very disappointing :("
Best film for 2019. We can't ever forget such an icon
"I love probably all Tom Hanks movies!
I mean, who doesn't..
But, accepting a movie funded by Tencent ???
For those reading who don't know, Tencent is one of the CCP's main dirty tools,
and if you're wondering why is that important, I urge you to climb out from under your rock and do your research on China!
STOP LETTING CHINA (the CCP really) SHAPING OUR WORLD,
and WAKE the hell up!
This information war has far worse implications then you imagine, so for the sake of free art, a free internet, a free future, see the threat for what it is and be smart in your decisions.
Good luck"
"I went into this movie with an open mind about it. I thought it was going to be more of a documentary or showcase the life of one of the kindest men to be on this earth. However, it was more of a story of how he influenced another man's life for the better.
Tom Hanks was incredible as Fred Rogers.
It will inspire you and hopefully will open some eyes in the world to allow for more people to treat each other with kindness.
Not one that needs to be seen on the big screen to fully enjoy. But, a nice day in the neighborhood.
I gave it a 7 as it is a little bit slow."
"I'm not gonna lie.... the only reason, why I went to see this movie was... Tom Hanks.
I think this is a movie made for the audience in the USA and people who don't know Fred Rogers (Like most Non-Americans) will view this movie with completely different eyes.You go into that movie thinking, that you gonna see Tom Hanks as the lead character, but thats not at all the case. At best, he is a supporting character for the lead of Lloyd Vogel, but I'd make a statement, that Fred is actually only a plot device in this movie. Don't get me wrong, Hanks is amazing in this role. Creepy, weird but so kind at the same time. It's hard not to laugh about his sincere kindness, but it will warm your heart for sure! We are not used to people being so kind these days, so it's pretty off putting.While Hanks and Rhys deliver great performances, this movie suffers from the (unfortunately still very common) problem, of creating weak female characters. Lloyds wife is beyond annoying and every other female character is as plain as a Dorito, you left in the bathtub for hours.While the ""outdoor/Ext. Shots"" are handled in a pretty interesting and artsy way, the rest of the movie lacks memorable cinematography. The end is as predictable as it gets, which is not a bad thing for this movie though, as it's the perfect fit for Hanks character, Mr. Rodgers.What this movie is best at is reminding you, that it's not hard to be kind and maybe we all should be more kind to each other, because kindness is the only thing you can't have enough of in this world nowadays!"
"I say this because it's less about Mr. Rogers in a biopic sense, and more a snapshot of an impact he made on a reporter's life. (Similarly to how Mr. Banks was less about Walt Disney, as one might think going into it.) That being said, it was still a beautifully made film, with artistic cinematography, wonderful acting and enjoyable music."
"I wanted to enjoy this film more than I did... The script was too cliched and on the nose with the journalist's story. Poor Matthew Rhys, I'm a big fan but he wasn't given much to do here that was interesting. I did like the model sets and the glimpse into the making of Mr. Rogers.Tom Hanks... ugh, didn't work for me. I wish it had been someone who was less well known and fawned upon, not to mention less jowly. Mr. Rogers was a spare person (143 lbs!) and that was related to his persona.All that said, the movie evoked kindness and calm at times which I greatly need in today's world."
"The marketing and title leads one to believe this movie was about the wonderful person that was Fred Rogers. Instead this movie is a story about a notoriously critical journalist writing about Mr. Rogers and the impact it had on him.
While Hanks does well at portraying Fred Rogers, who I understand is his 6th cousin, this movie tells you little of who you are lead to believe is the central character.
Watch 'Wont You Be My Neighbor?' (2018) instead
Mr. Rogers was shy, introverted child with health issues that became president of student council, member of honors society, obtained multiple degrees including music graduating magna cum laude, seminary, ordained minister of the Presbyterian Church, ... He wrote and edited all the episodes, played the piano and sang for most of the songs, wrote 200 songs, created all the characters, played most of the major puppet roles, hosted every episode, produced and approved every detail of the program.
Fred attended graduate School of Child Development, and worked closely with a child psychologist. taught young children about civility, tolerance, sharing, and self-worth, tackled difficult topics such as the death of a family pet, sibling rivalry, the addition of a newborn into a family, moving and enrolling in a new school, and divorce. Even dealt with the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy days after it occurred.
There has been nothing else like Mr. Rogers Neighborhood. Groundbreaking and wholesome. When Sesame Street emerged it covered school readiness."
A beautiful testament to a man who strove in goodness and grace. What a wonderful reminder of the powerful effect that people can have on one another's lives. A definite tearjerker that will go down in film history with quite a few other great viewing experiences.
"I enjoyed this film so much. It's so rare to find a movie that's both heartfelt and well made. The acting is great, as is the writing and directing. It takes artistic liberties that match Fred Rogers' outlook on life and created a narrative that makes you happy and reflective. Enjoy this one- there aren't many like it."
"A lot of films have moved me to tears, made me laugh scared me, even made me angry. This is the first time one made me want to be a better person. That's a truly rare quality in a film.The acting is great. Hanks is fantastic as usual. The structure of the film is also a great homage to Mr. Rogers. For a film that's not about Mr. Rogers, you sure learn a lot about him."
"I'm still grumpy over the documentary about Fred Rogers, WON'T YOU BE MY NEIGHBOR? not even being nominated for best documentary, but I chose to see this movie anyway. It stars Tom Hanks as Mr. Rogers. The story is based on an ESQUIRE article by Tom Junod called ""Cab You Say 'Hero'?"" in which the usual expose-writing writer is told to interview Fred Rogers. Matt Rhys, who plays the writer, finds the affair....unsettling. He's looking to rip the amiable mask off the fellow, but finds him a quiet, sharp man who seems to have done his own research on the writer and picks, picks, picks at the fellow until he winkles out his issues. He quietly denies being a saint, admits to being an imperfect parent, who, his wife notes, has a terrible temper. Everyone, however, is incredibly vague and protective. Rhys keeps trying to find the joint between the public mask and the face beneath, and winds up learning a lot about himself.The choices of what to leave out are interesting. Fred Rogers was an ordained Presbyterian minister who used the TV show as a non-denominational pulpit to address children and their issues. He was the most unlikely of TV stars and his show was filmed in the most awkward of manners, yet parents knew that their children were safe with him, even as he expressed his love for everyone and discussed disturbing subjects.This is best summed up in the sequence where Rhys is asked to meet Rogers in New York. They take the subway to his Manhattan apartment, and are serenaded by his theme song by a carful of children, Black teenagers, cops and young adults.Hanks gives a fascinating performance. He lets you see that Mr. Rogers is indeed a public mask that he never lets slip... when anyone else is around. The way he slips around the interviewer's question to question the interviewer, shows at once a great intelligence, real concern for his fellow human being, and fear of something dark within himself."
"Having finally viewed this film last night, after months, weeks, and days of anticipation, hoping it would live up to the hype surrounding Tom Hanks's much lauded performance and Matthew Rhys's role as a composite of different people, including Tom Junot, whose article in Esquire magazine was the major impetus and starting point for the film, I can safely say it definitely lived up to it, and then some! Indeed, there were moments when I wasn't seeing Tom Hanks, but Fred Rogers, himself. Certainly, there have been people who have complained, commented, argued that Tom Hanks does not ""look"" like Fred Rogers, doesn't have the same speech inflection, and appears very little in the film. The main thing to keep in mind is that they were not going for an all out biopic of Fred Rogers. Rather, they were showing us the impact he has had on other people, including our main character, played brilliantly by Rhys. The essence, the spirit, and the presence of Fred Rogers was what was important: who cares if Tom Hanks didn't look or sound like Rogers? They captured his spirit, his humanity, and his presence! Tom Hanks is, without a doubt, the finest actor of modern cinema. He makes you believe the characters he plays, even with the little flaws. Case in point: Jim Lovell is left-handed, and Tom is right-handed; who cares? He took you on the Apollo 13 with the rest of the crew and he captured the essence of what it was like on that ill-fated mission!
Okay, rant over.
This movie moved me to tears, sometimes laughter, and then tears again. I really believe the real Fred Rogers would have just been tickled being played by Tom Hanks, having said Forrest Gump was one of his favorite movies, having seen it 40 times, and Tom Hanks was his favorite actor. Only Tom Hanks could make the little moments work, commanding his screen presence and asking of you, dear viewer, to for one minute, think of all the people who have touched your life and made you who you are today. Can you think of any other actor who would ask this and you do as asked? Probably not. It is his sincerity, looking straight at you. You are completely mesmerized and if you're caught up in the movie, you will follow suit.
As for Matthew Rhys. He was truly remarkable as Lloyd Vogel. Yes, it is his movie, in spite of Tom Hanks figuring most prominently in the movie posters, trailers, etc. Yet, Tom allowed Matthew to shine, not stealing scenes away from him, but allowing Matthew to bring the movie together. He is, in so many ways, the audience. The audience watching Mr. Rogers. And the same audience has no choice but to acknowledge there have been people in our lives who have wronged us, deserted us, and hurt us, but there are also people who have loved us, shared themselves with us, grew up with us, nurtured us, and encouraged us.
The rest of the supporting cast were just that, supporting. They helped move the story along and you cheer for them, weep for them, understand them, and ultimately, you feel as if they are your own family, friends, or associates.
So while you may feel duped, instead, take the time to allow yourself to appreciate the beautiful story. Do not be cynical. There could be much worse ways of spending the hour and fifty minutes it takes to watch the movie. Yes, I know some would be bored. And that's okay. But if you like good stories with a positive spin, even fantastic at times, just take some deep breaths and allow yourself to be taken. And in a good way!
I hope Fred would've said, ""I appreciate your point of view."" If you took the time to read this, I just wanted to say thank you. Thank you.
So, who has loved you into being, made you the best you you can be??? Take a minute of silence and think of them. Then when that minute is over, be assured how glad those people will be that you remember them!"
"To quote a line from this movie. That was wonderful is an understatement. This movie went above and beyond any expectations I had for it. The story line was amazing and no one could have pulled off Mr. Rogers better than Tom Hanks. Hanks nailed every aspect of Mr. Rogers. The voice, facial expressions, and manerisims. Everyone from this generation to the generations who grew up watching Mr. Rogers will fall in love with this movie."
"Tom Hanks is great in his performance as Mr. Rogers. He achieves a multifaceted, dynamic character played with such self-deprecation that he becomes a walking, talking open book--even when he can't speak.But there is another, and I think more surprising, steller performance in this film. Michael Rhys delivers a beautiful, complex, and even heartrending character we can all identify with. He wears his anger openly and comes to learn that it is deeply rooted in fear. His character's journey is one the audience shares. We understand his pain, his confusion, his trauma, and his frustration when dealing with the nicest guy in the world. But we also grow with him. Love with him. Forgive with him. It is through him that we learn to love Mr. Rogers all over again."
"I saw""A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood"", starring Tom Hanks-The Post, Turner & Hooch; Matthew Rhys-The Americans_tv, The Post; Chris Cooper-Syriana, The Bourne Identity and Christine Lahti-The Blacklist_tv, Chicago Hope_tv.
This movie is based on a true story about a reporter named Tom Junod who wrote an article for a magazine about tv children's host Fred Rogers. The movie is mostly about the two men's relationship and how they became good friends. Tom plays Fred Rogers and Matthew is the reporter. Matthew is a person that is pretty much the opposite of Tom; he is angry at people in his life and struggling with how to forgive them, plus he doesn't believe anyone can be as kind and gentle as Tom appears to be on tv-he thinks it is just an act. Chris is Matthew's father who has issues with Matthew and Christine is Matthew's boss that gives Matthew the assignment of writing a profile on Tom. It is an emotional story and Tom-as well as everyone else-does a great job in his portrayal. I liked how they would use what looked like the sets of the old tv show-the toy houses & cars & people, etc-between scene changes and they even recreated scenes from the tv show. During the end credits, you see and hear the real Fred Rogers singing a song. Overall, it was a beautiful day at the movies.
It's rated ""PG"" for a brief fight and some mild language and has a running time of 1 hour & 48 minutes.
I don't know if I would buy it on DVD-I know lots of people would but one viewing was enough for me-but it would be a great rental, especially if you are a fan."
This movie brought tears to my eyes when I left the theater It Was touching Beautifully shot well directed it made you feel like you were right there with Mr. Rogers in his television house
"If you ever have any doubts about yourself, watch this movie, and know that he would have treated you in a special, unique way. This was a wonderful biopic about an incredible person. Do not miss it, worth the watch in theaters."
"Having avoided any reviews, this wonderful movie took me completely by surprise. A totally satisfying portrait of redemption and renewed faith in humankind. As a result I will likely face each daily dilemma by asking ""What would Fred do?"""
"I see alot of people complaining that it's not a documentary, did you watch a single trailer or read anything about the film before you forked over your $10? The 1/10 rating don't seem to have seen the film and just the typical idiots trying to crap on ""hollywood liberals.""The film was thoroughly enjoyable. It reminds you what a true christian is. Fred Rogers was full of a kindness that not many have. If we all strived to have just a little of the kindness and patience he had the world would be a better place."
There was only one Mr. Rodgers. Tom Hanks absolutely brought the warmth and humanity that was needed to portray such a childhood icon for so many. Having grown up watching mr Rodgers it saddens me that he was one of a kind because the world needs more people who talk about things the way he did. Take your mom and just go watch this and have a good time.
"When I first saw Tom Hanks on screen as Mr. Rodgers I was not sure. He really butchered that theme song in my eyes, but what's important is that he truly captured the spirit of Fred Rodgers. Hanks is just an amazing actor like that.
So not really the movie about Mr. Rodgers I was expecting. Everything almost plays out like a really long episode of Mr. Rodgers Neighborhood, and not even his most adult one.
If you are like me and watched Fred as a toddler Guaranteed you are going to be holding back some tears of joy.
This man truly is a hero and this movie totally does justice to him."
"I knew that the film was more about the journalist, and I grew up watching Mr Roger's Neighborhood, but this movie was incredibly boring. One of the worst movies that I have ever seen. I found myself looking at my watch after the first hour hoping that the movie would be over. It was too slow paced. Horrible, horrible movie!"
"The audience in this small town theater was mostly middle aged people on the Monday after Thanksgiving. We waited through the many ads and previews and when the tiny model town familiar to us all came on screen you could hear all of us chuckle....it was exactly as we remembered it! Tom Hanks portrayed Fred Rodgers so well we thought Mr. Rodgers was back with us. The story, though, was one we didn't know. We were kids when it happened. But, it impacted us all now as adults, and we cried. Make no mistake, we cried tears of sorrow and tears of pride. It was pride in a man who was SO kind, so gentle and so important to all of us.
This movie was lovely. Well acted, well told, and if not seen, you will be lose out on the gift that was Mr. Rodgers.
Thank you, Mr. Hanks, for bringing him back to us."
"I enjoyed this movie.
I was expecting a biopic with Tom Hanks doing a passable job of imitating Mr. Rogers, but nothing extraordinary. What it actually is it is a touching point of view of who Fred Rogers was: Just a kind person treating people the way he would like to be treated.
It's nice to see a movie that you pretty much predict how it is going to go and it turns out to be completely different and much better because of it.
Tom Hanks didn't do an over the top impression of Mr. Rogers, he was still very much Tom Hanks but conveying who Mr. Rogers was. I though all the cast played their roles with a true feeling of people actually meeting Mr. Rogers with preconceived ideas of who he is onstage vs offstage.
I grew up in the Mr. Rogers era and I watched it every now and then as a kid, but no way was I a fan of the show, but as I read more about who Fred Rogers was in my adult years, he truly is someone needs to be admired, respected and loved. This movie was a great representation of that."
"I've watched both the documentary (which was smashing) and just got out of this film. I don't get how you could hate this as it's more of a surreal take on what was already known and took it through the lens of a fictionalized version of actual events. The brilliant choice to start off like it's an actual episode, complete with the intro music and song, and using the original cameras from the show to really get the authentic feel actually served to make this movie feel perfect and not gimmicky as some might think.Now it does follow a different character instead of Fred all the time. But it felt more like a location shot for the show than a throughly removed part of the tale.The greatest part I enjoyed the most was the acid trip dream sequence when Lloyd passes out.One can enjoy both of these movies without being hyper critical of this one. There are a few story ideas they could have done better, but overall this movie is wonderful!"
"Ok I am 47 Years Old and I remember this Show growing up. ""Mr.Hanks"" was Brilliant in this Film. I really mean that and when he was Talking to that reporter. The look on his face in a couple of the parts I thought he was going to BREAK INTO TEARS.
He went to ""Interview"" him. Then he was being ""INTERVIEWED"" BYE HIM.
IT TOTALLY CHANGED HIM AS A MAN.
Oh and that Stuff with his Old Dad had me in tears why????
Because my relationship with my Dad was ""CRAZY"" as well.
But it does NOT MATTER.
That one part when it was explained that HE HIMSELF HAD TROUBLE WITH HIS OWN CHILDREN.
He simple said WELL WE ARE NOT ""PERFECT""
BUT WE WORKED THINGS OUT AS THEY GOT OLDER.
HE IS A MAN ABOVE MAN.
My Favorite part was when he just SHOWS up at there House. They didn't expect it with a Homemade Pie to say thank you for the Story in the Paper.
Then he wished into his Father's ear. What about???
It was Funny, Beautiful, Adorable, what he had said to him.
This is a MUST SEE FILM. I WILL BUY IT WHEN IT GOES ON DVD.
Come on HOLLYWOOD THIS IS A DVD ""WINNER""
THE CAMERA WORK BROUGHT YOU BACK IN TIME AS WELL.
The Special Effects were ""CORNY"" BUY A MUST FOR THAT FILM WHY???
Because it actually brings you back in time. You can see wires and everything. I found that PART TOTAL AWESOME."
"In an era that saw the Vietnam War's lasting effects on veteran fathers and rising divorce rates leave an indelible impression upon young children's, Mister Rogers did not shy away from talking about her things like divorce, death and war with his young audience and helping them sort through their feelings.
I am glad those who made this movie took their subject, Mr. Rogers, as seriously as he undertook his own mission to minister to young children in his own idiosyncratic way, even as Jesus, no matter what, ministered to the children, telling his impatient disciples, ""suffer little children, and forbid them not, to come into me for of such is the kingdom of heaven.""
My only complaint is that the magnificent musical contributions of Johnny Costa, who has been hailed as the ""white Art Tatum"", gets short shrift in the film. Mr. McFeely and the lady who talks to the hand puppets make their appearance in the film, but not John Costa. When I was little, I wanted to grow up to play jazz piano like I heard in the closing credits on ""Mister Rogers Neighborhood"" every day. To this day, I would love to see Johnny Costa's music for the show as painstakingly transcribed in note-for-note sheet music transcriptions as Art Tatum's or Jelly Roll Morton's recordings and published by the Smithsonian Press. Ah, well...
That said, as a grandchild whose grandparents' sad story is similar to that of the Esquire writer's parents', I went through several facial tissues during the course of this film which is ultimately about hurt and forgiveness and how demonstrating God's love can help mend broken people. As Rankin-Bass' beloved classic, ""The Little Drummer Boy""''s immortal status has shown, this is a visceral theme children, young and old, are forever drawn to."
Tom Hanks did a awesome job . Hope he wins a award for did.
"Watching A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood is like having a conversation with an old friend. Nothing really amazing or unexpected happens, but it's a pleasant experience that makes you feel warm inside. While Tom Hanks never quite disappears into the role of Fred Rogers, he emulates the spirit of Mr. Rogers and that seems to be just as effective. In fact, if more people emulated Mr. Rogers, this world would be a better place."
"A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood is a wonderful tribute to Fred Rogers while also telling a good story about forgiveness and kindness. Obviously, Tom Hanks does a fantastic job. It's one of those few perfect casting decisions. I can see no one else playing Fred Rogers. The rest of the actors do a pretty good job but my issue is with some of the characters. Some of the characters are not memorable but Matthew Rhys' character was extremely unlikeable. The film tries to portray his character as unlikeable for the first part of the film but they did this a little too much to the point where I started dreading seeing him on screen. It does get better as his characters arc progresses but you don't want to make your character too unlikeable or the audience won't be able to sympathize with him. The story of the film is pretty good. I somewhat like seeing this overly pessimistic character being shown forgiveness and kindness from one of the nicest men on the planet. The film knows how to tug on your heartstrings and give a heartfelt story. Every word out of Tom Hanks' mouth is so impactful and powerful. There is a beautiful scene in the later half of the film where Tom Hanks talks about death. It was incredibly beautiful and powerful to me having had a relative pass away earlier this year. I also really enjoyed the opening 10 minutes. It's shot and looks like a Mister Rogers' episode that introduces the main characters and the main themes of the film which I thought was great. There a handful of technical aspects that I really appreciated or liked. When the film transitions to different locations, instead of showing shots of the city, it shows a model of the city created in a way that looks similar to the models on Mister Rogers' Neighborhood. I thought the music was pretty good although not very memorable, same with the cinematography. If you love Mr. Rogers', then I think you might like this movie. Overall, A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood showcases a fantastic performance from Tom Hanks with a beautiful and heartwarming story and themes even if Matthew Rhys' character is extremely unlikeable for the most part."
"The movie begins just like any other Mister Rogers Neighborhood TV show. Tom Hanks was spot on in playing Fred Rogers. This film brought me back to my childhood, but is not as sad as the trailer depicts. The movie is not primarily about Fred Rogers, but rather another man who Mister Rogers influences in a positive way."
"Tom Hanks is always good and did a great job playing Mr. Rogers. But the storyline is dark and odd, to say the least. Weird how the story unfolds. Not a fan and wouldn't recommend. Disappointed."
The best Film I've ever watched. Tom Hanks with his extra ordinary acting.
"There is more than one way to tell the story of a person's life. This movie goes beyond the wonderful documentary already released. This film combines scenes of the subject himself along with separate scenes showing the impact that he had on other's lives. The scenes without Tom Hanks still have Fred Rogers in them but they are conveyed by his wonderful effect on other people's lives . Personally, I think this is a great way to memorialize a person in addition to a straight documentary. You actually feel what type of person he was, you are not just told."
"The first 10-15 minutes made me wonder if I'd made a mistake in selecting it, but then the movie set the hook and reeled me in. Sappy? Maybe a little. But overall a winner."
"""A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood"" is the movie America needs right now. Just go see it and don't even bother reading the rest of this review. It's okay if you have no idea what the movie is about. Really. Believe me.In ""A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood,"" Tom Hanks gives the performance of a lifetime as Mr. Rogers, a beloved American children's TV icon. Hanks inhales and exhales Rogers, and somehow manages to ice the cake with his own unique Hanksian genius. Fred Rogers was a devout Christian. He demonstrated, rather than preached, Christianity. The Mr. Rogers of ABDITN is a saint, in the very best way. He brings joy and hope to those around him, often in surprising ways. And, yes, that is why you should see ""A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood."" That part of the movie earns a 10 out of 10.The rest of the movie is standard-issue soap opera, and it's more of a 7 out of 10. Matthew Rhys stars as Lloyd Vogel, a cynical, muckraking journalist who is assigned to profile Mr. Rogers. I don't know if Rhys is a good actor. Maybe director Marielle Heller told him to mope so that the viewer would know that Lloyd is a tortured soul. In any case, Rhys mopes. He looks sad and unkempt. He is abrupt with others.In real life, people who have hidden wounds often do not look sad all the time. Rhys' one-note performance doesn't open any windows of insight into what it's like to have had an abusive parent.Susan Kelechi Watson plays Lloyd's wife Andrea. These two never convey the chemistry of a married couple in a complicated relationship. Watson looks picture-perfect in every scene. Her makeup is perfect; her clothes are pristine. She's supposed to be playing an attorney and new mother. Totally not believable to anyone who has spent any time with a new, working mother.Watson's and Rhys' shared scenes left me cold and confused. What are they to each other?Chris Cooper plays Lloyd's abusive dad, Jerry, who comes back into Lloyd's life. Again, I just didn't feel that anything real was at stake in these scenes.The domestic strife scenes in this movie struck me as paint-by-numbers, as someone writing in a writing class, someone who hasn't really lived or felt the material but knew that a thrown fist and an illness diagnosis would get paint-by-numbers reactions from the audience.My other concern is more about substance than style. The movie sends the message that if you are nice to people, even people who have proven themselves to be unreliable, those people will be nice to you back.In fact in real life one of the key lessons of being abused is ""Don't allow yourself to be vulnerable to abusive people, and yes sometimes you have to walk away and not look back.""So, no, the rest of ""A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood"" does not live up to Tom Hanks' terrific performance, or Mr. Rogers living out of Christian values. But that's okay. Go see the movie anyway. And bring a hankie."
"Beforehand I was wondering how Tom Hanks was going to pull it off because his voice is so different from Rogers', but by the end it didn't matter. And ""A beautiful day in the Neighborhood is a biopic, but it isn't about Fred Rogers' life story--the story is Fred's impact on other people, summed up in Lloyd. A brilliant way to do it.And with Hanks' ability to conjure emotion mixed with his portraying Mr. Rogers, it was like every time he opened his mouth he was trying to wrench every bit of emotion out of you. It was a plot line that was so simple and predictable but yet so profound. I've really never experienced anything quite like it. I never watched Mr. Rogers as a kid but I feel like I did now."
"I thought this movie looked stupid and Tom Hanks looked like he would do a cookie cutter performance as Fred Rogers. I was surprisingly mistaken. Tom really transforms into the character and it's believable that Fred Rogers is in this film and impacting the lives of the people he meets. Just think of how hard that is to do, given Mr. Rogers iconic status? The movie itself is kinda dark and experimental, which I was not expecting. An Oscar nom for Mr. Hanks is def in the works."
"Was never a watcher of Fred as he was before my time yet read many stories and saw clips and interviews and I found out that he was a kind soul. For the simple fact that he loved everyone because they were different, because they should be or were meant to be. With this latest ""A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood"" this is not a profile or bio type doc of Fred Rogers, it instead shows how his influence and emotional kindness rubbed off on another.The film really is more about Tom Junod(Matthew Rhys) a journalist for a magazine who gets the story and profile of a lifetime when he does a cover interview about the one and only Fred Rogers(Tom Hanks). The film then blends connection and the forming of friendship so well between the two as it's nice to see the humanity and loving nature develop. The film is moving and touching as the scenes and sets try to create a real feel of the actual day and time of Mister Rogers. Overall good showcase of friendship and connection proving that love and kindness helps people."
"First Hit: I was deeply touched by this film about how kindness and forgiveness can move internal mountains.Unlike the recent documentary about Fred Rogers, which gives an insight to the man, this film opens the door on this enigmatic kind soul named Fred Rogers by watching him work with an adult.The opening scenes with Rogers (Tom Hanks) talking to the camera as he enters the famed neighborhood set, sitting down, taking off his shoes and putting on tennis shoes and a sweater was precious. While watching this scene, I was transported back in time, sitting in the living room with my young daughter watching Mr. Rogers open the door to children's hearts and minds.In this story, Lloyd Vogel (Matthew Rhys), is an investigative reporter who has a reputation of taking cheap shots at people or discovers the darker sides of individuals and writes stories that do not reflect positively on his subjects. He's not the reporter you want to have to write your story.Getting an assignment to write a short four-hundred-word piece about Rogers for Esquires Magazine's hero edition, Lloyd chastises his boss for assigning him to write a fluff piece. When Vogel gets home and tells his wife Andrea (Susan Kelechi Watson) about this horrible assignment, she bemoans, ""don't ruin my childhood."" This is the perfect setup.As Lloyd and Fred meet for an interview, Vogel is perplexed by the way Rogers approaches the question, sometimes answering it directly, and other times deflects or answers a different question - the one not asked. Slowly, Roger's magic of compassion and kindness begins to work on Vogel in underlying ways. He begins to question his anger and the way he's participating in his relationship with his wife and new baby.During the interviews, Vogel, at times, gets upset at not getting the answers he is looking for and walks away from Rogers. However, once he steps away, he knows there is something there and goes back. Each time he learns more about himself as well as Fred.It's through these sporadic interviews, Vogel begins to learn how he needs to change his life by processing his inner anger towards his father, Jerry (Chris Cooper). As the story unfolds, Lloyd hasn't seen his father since he was a little kid. His mother also died while he was young, and his father couldn't deal with it, so he bailed.The film is a beautiful orchestration of how Fred Rogers operates in the world, how people see him, his version of kindness, and how he reaches out and touches people, young and old with honest and real sincerity.I loved how the filmmakers interspersed Mr. Rogers's sets, set pieces, and traveling between Pittsburgh and NYC. It was ingenious, to say the least.Hanks was sublime as Rogers. The ability to make the audience sense and feel the embodiment of Fred Rogers was terrific. Rhys was clearly perfect as the reporter who had the willingness to travel through his anger, sadness, and sorrow to come to grips with how he was going to be in the future. Watson was terrific as Lloyd's wife. Her compassion for Lloyd's struggles was wonderfully portrayed. Cooper was powerful as Lloyd's father, a man who did wrong and was trying the only way he knew to find forgiveness and peace within himself. Maryann Plunkett, as Fred's wife Joanne was excellent. Her understanding of Fred and how he worked was divine. Micah Fitzerman-Blue and Noah Harpster wrote a fantastic script. Marielle Heller was deft in creating a film that captured this iconic man.Overall: This story took me on a trip and brought up genuine, deeply felt feelings and emotions."
"A BEAUTIFUL DAY IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD
Directed by Marielle Heller
The first five minutes of Marielle Heller's A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood are pure nostalgia. Noah Harpster and Micah Fitzerman-Blue's screenplay beautifully crafts Mr. Rogers as the storyteller of a troubled journalist. I was instantly reminded of my childhood when the film began in the same manner and rhythm as Mister Rogers Neighborhood would begin. Marielle Heller, her cinematographer, Jody Lee Lipes; and her editor, Anne McCabe, beautifully and subtly immerse the audience in the world of Mr. Rogers. The use of the cameras that were used to film Mister Rogers Neighborhood augments how personal this film is on a technical and emotional level. The 4:3 aspect ratio of the TV cameras, expanding to the 16:9 aspect ratio of the film convey the film's theme on how, as adults, we leave our childhood behind. As adults, we forget the essence of what makes life, truly, worth living and acknowledge the people who have helped us become the person that we want to become. Matthew Rhys' character, Lloyd Vogel, who is a jaded journalist from Esquire, embodies this sad emotion of how, as we get older, we tend to feel uncomfortable in expressing our feelings and emotions. The angel that comes into his life, and patiently listens to him, is none other than the most beloved human being, Fred Rogers, played by America's Sweetheart, Tom Hanks. Lloyd Vogel is sent to interview Mr. Rogers and write a profile on him. However, the roles reverse, when Mr. Rogers starts asking Lloyd about his family and his childhood. And this is where the film becomes a therapeutic form of cinema and storytelling.
Tom Hanks, as Mr. Rogers, telling the audience, on the silver screen, that, ""I like you, just the way you are!"", is equally as comforting as getting a warm hug from your parents. Tom Hanks embodies the spirit, personality, and mannerisms of Fred Rogers with a very nuanced and spiritual performance. Every time he is on screen, one feels an everlasting emotion of happiness, love, and joy! Tom Hanks not only portrays the everlasting kindness and compassion of Fred Rogers; he beautifully portrays the spirituality and resilience of Fred Rogers in a countless number of scenes. Whether he sings all the iconic songs from Mister Rogers Neighborhood, uses the puppets to convey his innocent feelings, or smiles ruefully at everyone he meets, Tom Hanks gives one of the best performances of his career since Captain Phillips. Matthew Rhys is equally brilliant as the cynical Lloyd Vogel. His screen presence and subtle performance makes the audience empathize with him and root for him, as he is being listened to Fred Rogers. Matthew Rhys gives an empathetic performance as someone, who doesn't realize the value of his childhood and his family. As he gradually becomes more accepting and forgiving, one is truly moved to tears by the end of the film. Chris Cooper as Lloyd's father is excellent; especially in one scene, where he beautifully symbolized the essence of self-reflection and forgiveness. The performances in A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood are incredibly ethereal.
Marielle Heller directs the film with an immense amount of sincerity and sensitivity. She beautifully prevents the film from being too melodramatic. Marielle Heller her editor, Anne McCabe, transitioning from scene-to-scene by using the toy model from Mister Rogers Neighborhood, innocently convey the film's endearing sentiments on acceptance, forgiveness, and kindness. However, A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood does suffer from certain scenes that are oddly placed. Particularly a dream sequence, which didn't really retain to the genuineness that were present in the scenes prior to the sequence. The humor in these scenes feel out of place and could've easily been cut from the film. The use of songs, in small moments, feel a bit intrusive to the rhythm of the film's screenplay.
A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood is film that reinforces the idea and fact that a simple act of kindness can truly leave an everlasting impact on someone. This film reminds you that it is ok to convey your feelings. It is ok to feel sad at times. It is ok to make mistakes. Tom Hanks' beautiful and compassionate portrayal of Fred Rogers, Mathew Rhys and the entire cast delivering remarkable performances, a beautifully structured screenplay by Noah Harpster and Micah Fitzerman-Blue, and Marielle Heller's nostalgic and sincere directing style culminate together and craft A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood as being the most healing film of the year. As you leave the theater, you will truly feel that listening to others and being accepting towards everyone make life worth living. We should seek blissful moments of silence and think about all those people who have helped us become the person we are today. With moments of self-reflection, we will realize that, ""It's such a good feeling to know you're alive."" (-:"
"One of the all-time Hollywood snow jobs. Should have been titled Lloyd. Of course, no one would have come. 65% about Lloyd, nothing to do with Fred. 15% each Rhys with Hanks as window dressing, Lloyd & Rogers roughly equal Maybe 5% about Fred. I am really disappointed that Hanks lent his name to this farce."
"I literally almost fell asleep at this movie. Sure this movie has heart and Tom Hanks and Matthew Rhys are incredible at their roles but that doesn't take away from this all out snoozefest. The speaking is all monotone and the pace is slower than a turtle. My grandma said it best ""there's nothing happening in this movie"" and why Matthew Rhy's character has bunny ears, (yes that you read that right) I don't know but that's just another reason to skip this movie. But if you loved mr Rogers growing up or want to see a movie with a message of the power of love and forgiveness and in today's harsh world go ahead give it a try and see this movie.
If you dare..."
"Story os very good. Otherwis, Tom hank is a greatest actor inHollywoo. The movie become one of the best movie in this year........"
"Tom Hanks showing he worked very hard preparing for the role A+, bringing an alcoholic father into the equation to bring down the character of what could have been a nice wholesome movie, (no doubt Micha Fitz and Noah Harpster's idea), makes this one crash and burn. If you are a parent and remember Fred as he once was, watch re-runs and don't take your children to this film as it doesn't represent what a great human being he was."
"If you are a fan of Tom Hanks and you watched the trailers you will be surprised to discover that Tom Hanks is in the movie less the 15 percent. If you are a fan of Mister Roger's Neighborhood or Fred Rogers the man you will discover that you know less of him and his show then you knew before you watched this movie. You are not paying to see Tom Hanks you are paying to see other actors, their storylines, some surrealism, and Mister Rodgers' brand protection. It should be called, ""A Journalist Journey, The Lloyd Vogel Story.""
In Frances McDormand Oscar's speech, two words that she said comes to mind when you watch this movie, ""Inclusion Rider.""If you grew up in Pittsburg or another city watching Mr. Rodger's Neighborhood and you were that little Asian, Hispanic, Black, Native American, or a minority kid and watched the show you could tell that someone or something we're missing in Mister Roger's Neighborhood. Unlike Mister Rodgers' Neighborhood the show, the movie with Tom Hanks has a very diverse cast and paints a very delightful picture of his neighborhood as if it had impacted a group of people that were often omitted from the Nielsen ratings. The unique thing about television is that you can review the old episodes and enjoy them for what they were, not for what we want them to be.Fred Rogers created the show, the music, was the star, directed, produced, and wrote the show. When you watch the movie you get the feeling that they are protecting the ""Fred Rogers"" brand. In the movie, when Mr. Rogers spoke, he always had something profound and enlightening to say and if you were to meet him you would have had a spiritual or magical experience. Unfortunately, you will not gain any information about Fred Rogers's life, the friendship between him and the journalist, or the process of creating and maintaining the show. It is about a troubled journalist finding inspiration in his life to complete his article.If you are a fan of Lloyd Vogel or the actor Matthew Rhys then this is the movie for you.Some movie goers will tell you that you should have researched and read about the real journalist, his article about Mister Rodgers', or watched the documentary movie before see this movie as a prerequisite in order to understand, appreciate, and justify the movie greatness. If that is what you did before you watched ""Captain Phillips,"" ""Sully,"" ""Apollo 13,"" The Post,"" "" Catch Me If Can,"" and ""Saving Private Ryan"" then this is movie for you and enjoy."
"Actually, yes, another good pro-christian film with Tom Hanks nice and... warm? Very comfortable, but its 2019 and this stupid politics everywhere. I know maybe one who choose cast for this film was colorblind, but I am not and I think its really offensive when you change sex or race of real people, so 9/10 for black wife of Lloyd Vogel. And I don't want see a day when Luther King will be played by white or asian. We live in modern world and if we have some shameful stuff in the past like blackfaces or man's who portrayed woman's (like in greek theater or whatever) this is not mean that we really must continue this stuff that goes on and on and on. Can Hollywood just STOP with this falsifications?"
The movie is about a guy who is a writer in 90s and had a bad time experiences with his dad as a child and they come back and meet at a wedding but any ways the movie did not have that much of mr roger himself so that sucked
"Definitely the feel good movie of the year!
📽Audience REACTIONS at its World PREMIERE in September:
😄😄😄😄😂😄😄😄😂😄😄😄😂😄😄😄😂😄😄😄(20 laughing scenes)
😢(1 cry)
🎶(touching musical moment)
🤐(1 minute of complete silence!)
🤓(learn about true events)
🏆(strong Oscar potential for best picture, Tom Hanks for supporting actor, and adapted screenplay)A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood (Marielle Heller) is perhaps the most feel-good film of the year. Beautifully demonstrating that Mr. Rogers' lessons are for adults too, this film transports viewers through his world without imposing a confining structural narrative.It is intriguingly funny even though it explores inner pain and anger through themes of fatherhood, heroes, and role models. With perfectly tender scenes to push viewers emotions to the edge, the film portrays how we can all use a little more kindness in our world. This film draws the viewer in. At the screening we saw at TIFF, the entire theatre was still through a whole minute of silent reflection during the film, spellbound in Mr. Rogers' world. The remarkable achievements of A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood would not have been possible without the remarkable talents of Tom Hanks, who perfectly embodied this icon of so many childhoods. All the cast were brilliant but when it counted, Tom Hanks faded away and all that remained was Mr. Fred Rogers."
"Tom Hanks is outrageously successful and can take us on wild rides, but.... He ain't no Fred Rogers."
Tom Hanks is brilliant and the whole film is a wonderful commentary on how life should be lived.
"I dare you not to like this film. Tom Hanks is the perfect Mr. Rogers. (Even almost creepy now and then. Look for the scene in the coffee shop.) Matthew Rhys - the consummate actor from Wales who does Americans better than Americans - makes being a troubled soul seem effortless. (It's not easy at all.) Chris Cooper brings off one more disagreeable character, and he makes it quite different from any of the same characters you've seen him do before. Susan Kelechi-Watson - as the long-suffering, patient wife makes more out of the role than the script seems to give her. And Christine Lahti gives Ellen - the ""shut-up-and-get-it-done"" magazine editor - a subtle humanity that was barely expected and beautifully woven in. A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood is NOT about Mr Rogers; he's really a supporting player. But the story - which could have been told without him - would otherwise not have worked. I dare you not to like it."
"So I watched A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood yesterday. I have definite mixed feeling about it.On one hand Tom Hanks plays Mr Rogers brilliantly, the look, the mannerisms are all there. Every time he's on screen you are immediately sucked into the movie.On the other hand you have Lloyd Vogel, a journalist who the movie is really about, mostly concerning his friendship and transformation with the help of Mr Rogers. Unfortunately when his story was being told (which was the majority of the movie) the movie dragged.... a lot. I didn't really care for any of the characters on his side of the story and the family drama felt very manufactured.In the end it wasn't a bad movie, it was just one with a split personality with a majority of elements that I wasn't expecting. i.e. less Lloyd and more Mr. Rogers. The scenes with Mr Rogers I would give a 9 and the ones with Llyod I would give a 2 or 3 averaging out to 6."
"Reading other reviews it seems that the primary problem people are having with movie revolves around expectation. Perhaps the marketing team and trailers are at fault, but if you go in knowing what to expect you are in for a real treat. I would recommend reading the Tom Junod article on which the film is based prior to seeing the film. If you know what you're getting, you absolutely won't be disappointed.Tom Hanks is the only person I could ever imagine playing Fred Rogers. He does an outstanding job, but he isn't alone. All of the primary roles do an amazing job of drawing you in and bringing you along on their emotional rides. The film is also well put together drawing on elements and structure from episodes of Mister Rogers Neighborhood.Overall, do yourself a favor and go see this movie, just read the original article first so you know what you're getting."
No perfect Fred...nonetheless the movie told the tale of him and the way people responded to him. I loved this movie.
"Fred Rogers has to be one of the most fascinating figures in the history of television. His children's program was revered for its simplicity, kindness, and thoughtfulness...and reviled or dismissed for much the same reasons. No matter what side of the fence you may have once found yourself, I believe that Rogers' overall message of hopefulness and positivity (with healthy doses of realism sprinkled in) plays well in the current political/social age. ""A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood"" does a great job of capturing all those currents on the big screen.For a very basic summary, ""Neighborhood"" follows the tract of Lloyd Vogel (Matthew Rhys), a journalist tasked with a very simple blurb assignment of American heroes and thus sent to meet Mr. Rogers (Tom Hanks). What Lloyd finds, however, is that the tables are often turned. Instead of him interviewing Rogers, Fred deconstructs (in his genteel way) Lloyd's anger/sadness, largely stemming from a poor relationship with his own father Jerry (Chris Cooper).One of the highlights of the entire experience is how the film is structured very much like a classic episode of ""Mr. Roger's Neighborhood"", right down to the iconic sweater-and-shoes opening and intercutting the cinema widescreen with 4:3 letterbox shots of the trolley clanging along amongst the miniatures. Even down to the content itself, which starts off perhaps a little uncertain but then progresses to a place of harmony, this is very much like those episodes you grew up watching, and that just feels good.While the main plot (""guy with daddy issues"") is almost overly simplistic, it actually provides a perfect opportunity to showcase the unique style of Rogers to work through conflict. Instead of high drama or voice-raising, Fred uses calming strategies to work through anger, whether in his own life or helping the lives of others. Again, a sort of soothing balm for the heated rhetoric often seen on the nightly news or cable news talk shows.Hanks, as usual, is a revelation. His next bad performance will be his first one. Down to the vocal inflections and bodily mannerisms, he truly channels the spirit of the iconic Rogers. Not an easy task considering how well-known and almost ubiquitous the man was. Davis and Cooper also provide the dramatically-charged interactions that are a needed counterpart to Hanks' understated nature.To be honest, ""A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood"" night even be a slightly better than 8-star film. The personal reason I settle on that ranking? I had previously seen the document ""Won't You Be My Neighbor"", which covers roughly the same material (but just happened to ""hit me"" first). This one doesn't stray too much from the content in that doc (for good reason...that's the good stuff). For those getting these messages and visuals for the first time, it may be even more powerful.Overall, this is a wonderful film that can be enjoyed by the entire family (it truly is PG through-and-through). The internal, plot-related content is moving, and the extrinsic messaging of Rogers' goals as an educator and entertainer are an important lesson to counter that of the popular media of today."
"This is more of a biopic of Esquire writer Tom Junod, fictionalized as Lloyd Vogel (Matthew Rhys). Lloyd had issues with anger. His interview with Mr. Rogers (Tom Hanks) proved therapeutic. Having watched the documentary on Fred Rogers, I was not overly taken by Hank's performance. The film was interesting but not overpowering. In a year of weak nominations, it could win some awards."
"Though I'm not a parent myself, I do fear about how I'm going to bring up children. We have to accept that no one is perfect and we simply have to do the best we can. Still, that does make me thing about how I was raised as I think about the triumphs and mistakes my own parents have done. They are role models and I try to consider the other role models I've grown up with. One such man is Fred Rogers, the lovable host of Mister Rogers' Neighborhood. He's the prime example of a saint, someone who's dedicated his life to helping children and how he approached it differently.It was only recently we had gotten a wonderful documentary on Rogers in Won't You be my Neighbor. While that movie was a biography that dwelled into his personality and philosophy, today's movie tells a story about a man who comes to understand that Fred Rogers is a guy who's just as nice as he was on TV. It's understandable that one might be questionable about him, especially in an age where a lot of misinformation is spread and people are simply not as trusting. This story shine through in A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood.In the late 90's, a reporter Lloyd Vogel (played by Matthew Rhys) has won awards, but has also gained a reputation for trying to expose his subjects, and is finding it harder to get assignments at Esquire. At the same time, he and his wife Andrea (played by Susan Kelechi Watson) have just had their first child born. The prospect of having become a father has frightened him as his relationship with his own father Jerry (played by Chris Cooper) is very dysfunctional. When Jerry ends up saying some things to Lloyd, the two end up in a fight at a family's wedding.Lloyd is assigned to interview Fred Rogers for an article on American heroes. Though reluctant to take on a children's television host, he gets a phone call from him personally and travels to Pittsburgh. It's there where he goes to the set of Mister Rogers' Neighborhood where he meets Rogers (played by Tom Hanks) who shockingly comes off as nice as he is on TV. Lloyd is determined to dive into Rogers' personality but starts to understand that perhaps the man's kindness starts to make himself reflect on his relationship with everyone.It's already hard to hate or even dislike a guy like Mister Rogers. A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood not only shows that Fred Rogers was just as human as anyone else, but just how he emphasized the importance of being patient and trusting. In order for this film to work, they needed a great actor for Rogers and Tom Hanks proves himself again a great actor. I was afraid that I was only going to see Tom Hanks, but I'll admit there were plenty of points where I got lost in his portrayal.Rogers also happens to only be a supporting character. The story is really about Matthew Rhys as a cynical writer who changes for the better. He not only represents the soul whose closed off nature has made him a bad writer, but of modern society who has become more paranoid about people in general. His journey is not an easy one, and can be tough when confronted about his child and his father. The movie even has a trippy sequence where his insecurities are on display in front of Rogers'. But within the bigger picture, it's still a story about how far kindness can get you without becoming a victim to naivety.A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood is not just an impressive story, but it's even shot in an impressive way. There are a couple of moments where I felt like I was back to my childhood. Some of it is when it tries to recreate the show through its obvious video photography and even screen ratio size, and some it comes through the structure of the script which evolves in a gentile manner. It's like the movie really wanted to be a slightly darker and longer episode of Mister Rogers' Neighborhood.I'll give this nine red trolley models out of ten. This is a movie I recommend for the family, even above Frozen 2 (which I'm sure most have seen already). I even recommend it for adults on their own. If anything, this may have been Tom Hanks most challenging role in a while. Its worth it alone to see him play such a kind figure. It certainly is a beautiful day in the neighborhood, so please got out and see this."
A genuinely moving film and tom hanks does a brilliant job playing Fred rogers
"Tom Hanks is sensational as usual, delivering yet another incredible performance that is definitely Oscar-worthy. The film itself was brilliant, as it really captures the importance of what Mr. Rogers was doing. He is seen as a very loving, caring, and compassionate person, yet they don't forget to mention that he is still a human being. We all make mistakes, get angry, and struggle with our emotions, but there are lots of ways that we can deal with our troubles. The story follows Lloyd Vogel, a journalist who profiles Mr. Rogers, overcoming his skepticism, while learning about empathy and kindness. Matthew Rhys (Lloyd Vogel) is absolutely fantastic, providing the audience with a very relatable character who goes through a world of change. The cinematography is stunning, the emotion is raw, and the subtle quietness throughout the film is impeccable."
"The new ""Mr. Rogers"" movie, A BEAUTIFUL DAY IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD is gentle, warm, slow, kind and heartfelt - just the type of film that is antithetical to how life is bounding past all of us on a daily basis. It would be well worth your time to slow down, turn off the electronics, and take in this wonderfully loving film.Tom Hanks, of course, stars as Mr. Rogers - the beloved TV Host of the beloved children's show MR. ROGERS NEIGHBORHOOD and he does a remarkable job of bringing this kind gentle soul to life. Hanks embodies all of what is good and right to this character, while still making him a real person. Hanks, no doubt, will be named an Oscar nominee for this performance - but it is in what category that might be a surprise to most.For, it will be as Supporting (not Lead) Actor for this is NOT a movie ABOUT Mr. Rogers. It is a movie that Mr. Rogers plays a strong Supporting part.This film is about the real, true-to-life relationship that Fred Rogers forged with troubled writer Lloyd Vogel (Matthew Rhys). Vogel is assigned by his boss at Esquire (Christine Lahti - who it was GREAT to see in a film) to do a quick ""puff piece"" on Rogers. This hard-boiled reporter is hell-bent on peeling the layers back on this man. The surface of Mr. Rogers is just ""too good to be true"" to this writer. What happens, of course, is that Fred Rogers peels back the layers on Vogel to help him understand his troubled relationship with his father (Chris Cooper) - and it is this relationship that is at the heart of this movie.And heart is what is at the center of this film. This film is filled with love, understanding, warmth and HEART in abundance. Fred Rogers helps Lloyd Vogel to slow down and understand - and deal with - his feelings that are impeding his relationship with his father. And it is this heart and warmth that touched me. I was brought to the edge of tears more than once during the course of the 1 hour and 49 minute length of this film (and I am not a cryer) it was that well done - and emotional - without being cloying.Credit Writers Micah Fitzerman-Blue and Noah Harpster (both of TV's TRANSPARENT) for adapting Tom Junod's real life Esquire article on Rogers in such a way that it is powerful, thoughtful and effective. They accomplished this by placing the events of this film, loosely, in the format of Rogers' beloved TV show and it worked well.What also worked well was the Direction of Marielle Heller (CAN YOU EVER FORGIVE ME) like her previous film (which garnered Melissa McCarthy a well deserved Oscar nomination), Heller keeps her camera relatively still and lets her actors act - relying on tight. lingering close-ups and lingering, quiet pauses for the full effect of the emotions behind the words to land on the audience and resonate.She would not be able to do this without a strong cast - and a strong cast she has. Besides Hanks, Matthew Rhys (TV's THE AMERICANS) is a steady calm. angry presence that anchors the film in the ""no way Mr. Rogers can be that nice"" mindset that almost all of us have at the beginning of the film to be slowly peeled away to reveal what is really causing the anger and cynicism emitting from his character. The always reliable Chris Cooper (Oscar winner for ADAPTATION back in 2002) brings pathos and regret as Jerry Vogel, Lloyds father. The relationship between these two is the balancing point of this film and it is balanced well. They are joined by a strong list of Supporting Actors (like Enrico Colantoni, Susan Kelechi Watson and Wendy Makkena) that bring strength and warmth to the proceedings without stealing focus on the main players. They all are SUPPORTING players and they SUPPORT the events of the film wonderfullyI strongly urge you to see this film in a ""closed environment"" - a movie theater, in a darkened room - without distractions (turn off your phone, close the shades if you are home) and let the warmth, gentleness, humanity and slow-pace wash over you. You'll be glad you did.Letter Grade: A- (Did I mention that this film is paced VERY slowly)8 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)"
"I agree with some of the other reviewers, it isn't a MR ROGERS movie. He's in it but it is more about how a reporter saw him and how Mr Rogers helped him through a rough patch. Tom Hanks needs an another award here. He channels the late child psychologist perfectly. Every scene he is in makes you want more -- amazing, gifted man. The overall feeling is down though with a dream sequence thrown in the middle to make you question your meds. It was great, should get an award for Tom, but a bit off-putting."
Coming from someone that has seen the wonderfully documentary about Mr Rogers this looked as an easy hit but main character was just not that interesting. That being said Lloyd did make Mr Rogers an even more likable actor. If that was even possible.
"A wonderful experience throughout, Tom Hanks was impeccable as Fred Rogers! Numerous adorable parts and incredible acting where I just wanna give everyone involved an award. Matthew Rhys did so good, I love all the father parts with him and when he talks to his wife. So much endearing aspects I'm so glad I was able to see A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood with my mom and the fact that I used to watch the show as a kid 20 years ago."
Very touching story. Not an autobiography like some expect but a story of a tough journalist who upon meeting and knowing Fred Rogers finally gets in touch with his own feelings and connects with the awesome kindness that Fred Rogers represented and lived 100% as he sees the love Mr Rogers shared and that the world shared with him as well.
"It feels rare these days to find a movie willing to take its time and live in moments, to really steep in the spaces between words and simply let what's on screen be impactful all on its own. A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood manages this well. Yes, it can be slow at times, but slow in a way that's methodical and with purpose. It isn't rushing to blurt something out, to fill silences with inane babble but then this is a movie with a very clear purpose in mind.Fred Rogers, by all accounts, was a remarkable man. His impact on the lives of countless children can't be overstated and yet, ABDITN doesn't focus on Mr Rogers directly but rather on a journalist interviewing him and the impact that he has. Of course, a film like this doesn't work without great performances and those abound. All of our characters are well portrayed as they progress through their varied journeys. Hanks, to no one's surprise, manages to steal this movie despite not being the main character. That said, Matthew Rhys delivers a marvelous performance as well that really lets us feel what he's going through.This is not a perfect movie though, there were some distracting things that, while not necessarily flaws because they seemed intended, took me out of the movie. The transitions, for instance, all utilize the model sets from Mr Rogers Neighborhood, which is a fun touch but took a little while to get used to and acts as a constant reminder that you're in a chair watching a movie. There's also a prolonged moment where Mr Rogers looks directly at the camera in, again, a very intentional way that just felt... Weird and heavy-handed.People are fascinating though. Growing up, I watched Mr Rogers Neighborhood. As I got older, I remember the stories that came out. Tales of Fred Rogers the special forces soldier, the man that had to wear those sweaters to cover his full sleeve tattoos. Myths that arose because it was just too hard to believe someone could legitimately be that good. A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood believes Fred Rogers was that good and what's more it believes that, with a little effort, anyone can be that good. So many people have said we could use a Mr Rogers these days and I think they're missing the point of the movie. Don't wish for someone to be that, be that yourself. It challenges us not to be perfect, but to be better and that is always a valuable message."
This movie was so much more than I thought it would be. Tom Hanks is Wonderful as always. But I was surprised at how good Matthew Rhys was. This is the first time I've really watched him in a movie and he did an excellent job. This is not a happy movie nor is it all about Mr Rodgers. I'm not really sure how much of this really happened but it's touches the heart and makes you feel something. Go watch it.
Audience won't be able to sympathize with him. The story of the film is pretty good. I somewhat like seeing this overly pessimistic character being shown forgiveness and kindness from one of the nicest men on the planet. The film knows how to tug on your heartstrings and give a heartfelt story. Every word out of Tom Hanks' mouth is so impactful and powerful. There is a beautiful scene in the later half of the film where Tom Hanks talks about death. It was incredibly beautiful and powerful to me having had a relative pass away earlier this year. I also really enjoyed the opening 10 minutes. It's shot and looks like a Mister Rogers' episode that introduces the main characters and the main themes of the film which I thought was great.
"This film is a beautiful story that does achieve in capturing the overall essence of Mr. Rogers. The story is inspiring and reinforces the power that kindness can have in the world. Director Marielle Heller does an incredible job at reconstructing the world around Mr. Rogers. You truly feel as though you are immersed within the story. A problem that arises though is the inability for the audience to view Tom Hanks as Mr. Rogers. Fully capturing the persona of Mr. Rogers is nearly impossible, and is in no fault that of Hanks. It just hinders the story telling ability to go an extra step further that would have elevated the plot. Moreover, at times the evolution of Lloyd Vogel feels rushed, and the dream sequence scene felt out of place. Despite it's inherent flaws, the film delivers and enjoyable experience and is a refreshing reminder of the positive contributions Fred Rogers gave to the world."
"I knew going in that this wasn't a movie about Mr. Rogers per se. Rather, it was about his impact one one individual and by extension, all of his fans. Tom Hanks nails Mr. Rogers. It's not an imitation, more like a channelling. The effect is powerful and heartwarming. You want more of him; and welcome each scene he's in. It's a different kind of feel good movie and one that makes you appreciate how lucky we (and our kids) were to have Mr. Rogers Neighborhood."
"4 out of 5 stars (one of the best of the year)I didn't grow up loving Mister Rogers. While his soothing voice and quiet demeanor lured my younger self to sleep, I have since grown to appreciate Rogers for addressing real-world topics with kids rather than talking down to them. Similarly, A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood won't interest kids, but their parents will find an honest yet hopeful drama that, like the man himself, reminds us to keep a positive outlook and see the good in others and ourselves.Jaded investigative journalist Lloyd Vogel (Matthew Rhys) has spent his life angry over the misdeeds of his father (Chris Cooper), and has begun to let his work and cynicism overcome his marriage. That cynicism is challenged when his editor assigns him to write a blurb on Pittsburgh icon Fred Rogers (Tom Hanks), the only man who will sit down with him. While Rogers' childlike optimism initially rattles Lloyd, both men slowly open up each other, becoming better people as a result.I joyfully cried through most of A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood. Playing Mister Rogers would prove daunting for anyone, but Tom Hanks perfectly embodies Rogers' positivity and warmth. Rhys and Cooper are also strong, and flashes of humor keep the film from becoming depressing. A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood reminds us all of the importance of being decent human beings to each other and accepting that everyone has good and bad sides that make us who we are. I can't think of a better message to enter the new decade with, nor a better film to preach it.While a perplexingly trippy James and the Giant Peach-esque dream sequence and an overlong final shot prevent a higher rating, A Beautiful Day In the Neighborhood is a well-acted, optimistic outing that will leave a smile on your face, a tear in your eye, and a warm feeling in your heart. See it, and stay through the credits to see a clip from the real man himself.Rated PG for Some Strong Thematic Material, A Brief Fight, and Some Mild Language"
"""A Beautiful Day In The Neighborhood"" is the most beautiful film of the year featuring a performance from Tom Hanks like you've never seen before.

It's a whirlwind of joy and sadness, all together making you rethink your own life and how you go about it day to day.

"I was really looking forward to this movie from the trailer but I was disappointed when watching. Although Mr. Rogers was shown in the kind light, the movie for me was missing the charm and magic element. I think this is due to the main character Lloyd Vogel being not very likeable. The story is told from Lloyd's point of view and the drama of parental issues overtakes the movie. I was hoping for more"
"Not a straightforward biopic, instead telling the story of Mr. Rogers through his ability to help a reporter work through issues with his father. The movie was unexpected and quite heartwarming. Very beautiful cinematography and superb acting."
"Incredibly entertaining, sweet, and memorable, A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood is not just a wonderful tribute to the legendary television icon, but a wonderful film as well. The acting is quite great, with Tom Hanks obviously providing for a fantastic Mr. Rogers, and Matthew Rhys does an outstanding and poignant performance as Lloyd Vogel (aka the journalist) in the film. The script and transitions can be both utterly amusing and somewhat hard to follow, but the emotion delved into along the way is more than worth the trouble. The film is quite in fact beautiful on its own tale of human conflict and emotion and tells it with such incredible feat it's hard not to be moved by it. The film also looks great, with some brilliant cinematography, and a wonderful 90's look that seems more than fitting for the time and place it appears in. In the end, A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood is exactly what I wanted it to be and more, and is certainly an emotional ride that is worth watching again, and one I will never forget.
My Rating: 9.75/10"
It makes you laugh. It makes you cry. It makes you love humankind. One of the best movies I've ever seen! A true gift.
"Directed by Marielle HellerStarring Tom Hanks, Mathew Rhys, Chris CooperMr. Rogers is a well-known children's tv personality. I entered the film knowing little about him, the main motivation for me was the great Tom Hanks.I loved how the film used the normal opening for Mr. Rogers's show as an intro to the story. Lloyd is a writer for a magazine and he is assigned to write a piece about Fred Rogers famous for his kids tv show. At first meeting the skeptic writer could not believe that Rogers was such a good person. As he kept meeting Rogers he discovers more about himself than about Rogers.What a beautiful story and to hear the writer of the article from which the movie is based that minor few details the things shown in the film are true makes it even more amazing. Tom Junod was assigned to do a piece and he says that Rogers picked him because he felt he could help him, and he did. This movie inspires us to remember that we are all the same and how we can change someone's life just by being kind. It dis not sell Mr. Rogers as a perfect man, it just showed a man who cared and tried to bless everyone around him.The style of the film I felt was unique and really used Fred Rogers as a figure that moves the story rather than a bio-film about him. The story is about Lloyd really and it made it better that if it was just a bio-pic, it gave it heart.Tom Hanks, what else is there to say about one of the best actors of all time. He is wonderful in this film. He is in my top 5 this year to be nominated for Best Actor in Oscar's and Golden Globes. I did not know that Chris Cooper was in this film and he was also great. The cast really were are good, I don't know other films where Mathew Rhys has appeared on, but he did a great job at showing the characters transitions through the film.It is a sad story at times, but also a refreshing story about the power of love and forgiveness. I absolutely love it."
"While so many people are rushing to accomplish material goals and make a name for themselves, I truly appreciated the focal point of this movie bing the impact each of has on each other as well as the need to SLOW DOWN. The simplicity this philosophy of life is profoundly difficult to practice for most modern day society but it is the only thing that will be helpful for shifting the energy we currently see, the energy that is destroying our planet and sickening the minds of our human lives. An unexpected perspective is a childhood treasure that inspired me to show my children the television show to reclaim some of that experience. What power there lies in just being nice."
"After Hanks showed us his excellent comedic chops in ""Bachelor Party"" and ""Splash,"" he finally shows us what's to come in this wonderful drama (in which he also maintains his great wit). What truly sells this movie for me is the performance of Gleason after working in some incredibly dismal pictures in the years preceding. He finally shows that he still had the ability that he showed in his early work, and that he wasn't just picking parts for a paycheck.Don't pass up an opportunity to see this underrated 80's gem, especially if you're a Tom Hanks fan that is just starting to find some of his early works, or just to see Gleason's terrific swan song."
"Anyone who has had pain in their life or who has been angry about things that have happened to them should find a useful message in this film. That's probably a lot of us.The characters are well written and performed with a special emphasis on Hanks' Rogers. I went in wondering how such a well known actor would play such a well known person yet he did become our beloved Mr Rogers on screen complete with intentional slower pace and gentle nature.The true power of the film though, comes from the care that Fred shows for Lloyd, at times seeking him out to help him find his way through a lifetime of anger that came from resentment. Lloyd calls himself broken but Fred disagrees. How many in the audience might feel the same way as Lloyd?As someone who has seen most of Mr Rogers' interviews I was happy to notice some of the most important points shown in the film. I suggest you search for the interviews as they will give you even more of what you were feeling during and hopefully after this film.When this medium works it not only tells a story, it helps you become more aware of who you are and how you feel. This film left me missing Fred Rogers and understanding that I can be a better person to those I love and forgive those who caused me pain."
"This movie is based on an article a writer named Lloyd Vogel wrote about Fred Rogers. To be clear, Mr. Rogers was more than different colored cardigans, sneakers, and puppets. He taught children about important things like feelings, accepting themselves for who they are, divorce and death. Tom Hanks is flawless as Mr. Rogers. He has the voice and mannerisms down pat! In this movie, Mr. Rogers taught Lloyd to forgive his neglectful father before the man died. The always great Chris Cooper was the father.
I do wish they had the fish tank and I looked for it. I also am curious if the miniature artist who worked on ""Hereditary"" provided his or her services to this movie for the miniatures? In a way, his movie has something in common with ""The Legend of Lizzie Borden"" with Elizabeth Mongomery as Lizzie. She and Lizzie were distant cousins and Tom Hanks and Fred Rogers were 6th cousins.
I think Fred Rogers is watching Tom Hanks with approval from paradise because Tom's performance was that good!"
Such a beautiful movie. That sixty seconds had a huge impact on me. We need more people like Mr. Rogers.
"I want to start off this review by stating that I am a huge fan of Mr. Rogers. He had an amazing impact on so many people, including myself, and he was just an outstanding human being who deserves to be idolized and listened to by so many people. He helped so many children in an incredibly powerful way, and he deserves all of the goodness that reality has to offer him. On to my thoughts on this film, I found a few issues with this movie. I felt like it didn't focus on Mr. Rogers quite enough, and on this same note, it didn't make me care enough for who you may call the main character of this movie, a journalist named Lloyd who met with Mr. Rogers to do a piece on him, and he was trying to find faults with Mr. Rogers, but he couldn't do a good piece in that way since he saw how incredible of a man he was and he decided to write a good piece on Mr. Rogers instead. It felt slow and uninteresting to me at some parts because I didn't care enough about this plot involving Lloyd. I did to an extent, but it wasn't good enough for me to find it particularly interesting. I would have enjoyed more of a focus on Mr. Rogers and seeing more nuance in him. Although they did address that he was not perfect, it seemed a bit silly to me personally that Lloyd couldn't find many faults with him and the way that this was went about. I understand that that was the point of the conversation between Lloyd and Mr. Rogers' wife, the point of Mr. Rogers talking about his relationship with his sons, and the ending of the movie with him smashing his piano, but I would have preferred more of a dig into some of Mr. Rogers' imperfections. I have incredible respect for Mr. Rogers, and I think that he was an incredible man, but I just feel like a movie that's about how good of a man someone is should be more about how good somebody is despite their imperfections rather than them lacking imperfections, and I felt that this movie fell far more into the latter. I also didn't really love all of the writing and acting, and some parts of it felt a tiny bit corny and perhaps even preachy in the ways that they went about with Lloyd hearing Mr. Rogers' words and how they affected his life. I like the concept, but I feel like it could have been done in a better way, with how complex Lloyd's situation was. I didn't buy all of the situations that happened in the movie such as Lloyd saying that he has a lot of anger that he needs to take care of to his wife on the bench (how simply stated these words were with little nuance or complexity besides him feeling anger), saying that he'll take care of the kids for six months and that she should work, etc. near the end of the movie. I think that's sweet if that's what they both want to do, but for most people, I find these sort of situations to be a bit unrealistic. With all of that said, there was a lot of good stuff about this movie. Tom Hanks was great as Mr. Rogers. He really found himself in the role and did a great job- he consumed the role, even to the minor details, and you felt Mr. Rogers' presence through him, and that was wonderful. Some of the other acting was great such as Matthew Rhys who played Lloyd. There were some very good moments throughout the movie, such as a very unique moment of silence where Mr. Rogers breaks the fourth wall and tells us to think about people who shaped our lives and made us feel better, accepted us for who we were, etc. as the real Mr. Rogers did as well. It was a moment unlike any other I've seen in cinema, and that was special. The movie was very well-produced and well-directed. The best thing that the movie did was really capture the soul and spirit of Mr. Rogers. He deserves it. They showed Mr. Rogers in a very good and accurate light. Overall, I liked the movie. I didn't love it, and I wished that they had focused more on Mr. Rogers rather than the plot of Lloyd and showed more Nuance in Mr. Rogers' story and character, but it was enjoyable and captured what Mr. Rogers was about."
"I feel Tom Hanks got the gig because of who he is, not because he was the best choice for the role. There are great documentaries already which I recommend over this dull-fest."
"What on earth do they think they're doing dragging us down into their despair? 'The dead don't slip away they scream in agony.' Leave poor Mr. Rogers out of your hellscape. Bizarre film. The turn of century cultural narcissism of today can only frame Rogers as Machiavellian, sadistic, in the closet; how else account for his untrustworthy pleasure in manipulation? Like the anti-hero, he's an anti-antagonist. But that's Hollywood, baby. The film is an act of cultural subversion. Its labyrinthic psychotherapy is something it can't even hope to back--that is a serious cinematic study, so if attempting to toil with humanity's ghost one should be prepared to go all the way, vs stopping short at fortune cookie lessons. Because what's in it for us? The lead's narcissism is excruciating. It means nothing about life. It's repetitive. How about start with Rogers instead? Is goodness so lacking with the writers they need to make him as ugly as they are? To break down our wholesome icons the way Rogers breaks down Vogel? How about the article that would come from it was this profound summation with how Rogers so changed him, yet there is never any moment in the picture where the journalist isn't afraid, skeptical, or annoyed by him. Where's the spiritual connection the film pretends is there? (""He takes a liking to your kind..."" ""My kind? Oh, broken people!"") So...he targets broken people because... he's Hannibal Lecter... playing mind games with subjects he sees himself in? You see these Hollywood writers are a dime a dozen how they project their disappointment, neurosis, and cynicism on life since they can't simply believe any inherent goodness there, it's like the biggest crime is being a decent person. How about 'Winnie the Pooh has major depression disorder' next? But wait that was a thing too. This is like the eighth Finding Neverland, which was still the best for this treatise. How magical and beautiful that film understood the symbiosis of humanity and art doesn't overpower the halves; while here seems to view Rogers with belittling suspicion and has little respect for what he does."
"Tom Hanks is great, as always, and the other actors do very well. However, it is not really about Mr Rogers, as much as it is about how he helps this badly messed up guy. Overall, it was dark and creepy, even some of the parts with Hanks.
Would not see it again."
"""Beautiful Day"" was a touching movie - but not at all what I expected. I thought it would be more about the show - which would be fascinating by itself. But I think the essence is that Fred Rogers was a true friend when one was needed. He helped millions of children in many ways. Not just educationally but taught values without preaching. Without ""spoiling"" I will say that he helped one person in his time of need. When my children were little. I watched the show sometimes when I was home during the day. Along with ""Sesame Street"" PBS provided a great forum for children. Growing up in Pittsburgh, um, ah, ""a few years ago,"" I watched the Josie Carey Show where Fred got his start. Mr Rogers along with Julia Child, and Masterpiece Theater, helped build PBS into a unique network. I salute him for that. Great performances by the entire cast. Special shout-out to Matthew Rhys. My only criticism - some very slow-moving parts. But overall worth seeing."
The headline says all. There is honestly nothing bad for me to say about this movie. Tom Hanks did a wonderful job portraying Fred Rogers. Everyone else did just as well.
What a great movie! Coming of age for adults! Hanks delivers.
"The Mr. Rogers movie isn't about Mr. Rogers.It's a story about a man named Lloyd. It's story of how Lloyd met Mr. Rogers, became his friend, and how Mr. Rogers saved Lloyd's life.Lloyd's life wasn't in danger in the literal sense. Lloyd didn't have a terminal illness for Mr. Rogers to cure. Lloyd didn't have suicidal thoughts for Mr. Rogers to quell. Lloyd's life was in danger in a different sense. He was in danger of losing himself and the things he cared about most.""A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood"" tells the story of how Mr. Rogers helped Lloyd mend his psychological fractures and face the demons that had haunted him since his childhood. Through their relationship, we get a peek behind the curtain of the impact that Mr. Rogers had on the lives of the people he met on a daily basis. He helped many children, of course, but he also helped adults too.Some viewers may fret over Mr. Rogers' limited screen time in the film and the focus on Lloyd. I disagree. The time we spend with Mr. Rogers is plenty revealing and impactful. Lloyd is a sensible character on which to build a story, because he has glaring flaws and a development arc. The great legacy of Mr. Rogers is all the lives he touched and the good he gave the world. Lloyd's story provides a wonderful example.Tom Hanks as Mr. Rogers is every bit as perfect as anyone would have guessed. He doesn't try to overplay it by doing an impression, mocking Rogers' body language and the like. What he does is find a way to capture the essence of Mr. Rogers, the beacon of positivity he became. The teacher. The friend. The nicest man in the world.That doesn't mean Mr. Rogers is perfect. He's not an angel born to be kind. He works on being kind every day. Only through consistent effort and intentionality of goodness does Mr. Rogers achieve his rightfully earned reputation. He serves as an example to all of us that we too can be kind, and we too can live the lives we want to live.It's perhaps the most inspirational and most important message we'll see at the movies all year."
"I wasn't sure what I expected going into the theater. I had supposed it to be a biography of Fred Rogers life. I was not expecting to be overwhelmed throughout the course of the movie as I watched this man interact with everybody he met. He wasn't allowed
performer who created a character. Fred Rogers WAS Mr. Rogers through and through. I wonder how many times that scene on the subway car played out."
This was a beautiful film with multiple tear jerking moments. I am probably biased because I loved Mister Rogers Neighborhood.
"If Tom Hanks doesn't receive an Oscar nomination for this movie, it will cement what I've suspected for years now that Hollywood has put Tom Hanks out to pasture."
"It really made me view life differently and think about the way I interact with people. Mr. Rogers is an inspiration for everyone. And Hanks, of course, played it wonderfully. I got emotional any time he would talk"
"I'll be honest, I actually didn't watch Mr. Rogers growing up. But I have a good understanding of who he was. And I think Tom Hanks did a wonderful job playing him. He doesn't look much like Fred, but his personality, his mannerisms, the way he talks; it's all there. But that's not all, Matthew Rhys was really good as Lloyd Vogel. Lloyd is this man who holds a grudge against his dad. And now he has a chance to talk to Fred, a man who knows how to handle something like this. At times, it's clear Lloyd isn't very keen on Fred's ways, but at the same time, you get a feeling he is listening. Lloyd also deals with sadness from loss, but of course, Fred steps in to help. Everyone in this movie is doing a good job bringing the real story to life. There's one moment when something happens and it feels it might not happen in real life. But later on, you actually buy it. The whole movie almost feels the same way, but whether or not it did happen, this movie shows us how we should handle things and how we should treat each other. And that's why I think everyone should give it a chance.8.3/10 (Really good)"
"While I found this movie touching and heartfelt, it was more about the supporting characters than it was about Fred Rogers. I was expecting a movie in line with the 2018 bio ""Won't you be my neighbor?"". But I still give it a 7 out of 10 for the nostalgia and memories it provided with the sets, music and kindness that Fred Rogers created for all of us to enjoy."
I never really enjoyed the show although my kids did. After seeing this movie I have become a huge fan and hope I can watch all the reruns with my grandchildren. What a wonderful man and what a wonderful life he. lead
"We all know Hanks was ideal for the role. He glides through it like Forrest Gump. Its a sweet, good movie. Like chocolate. With his experience. Its no surprise he nails it although, its not Mr. Rogers. I also thought he lacked screen time. Might win Oscars. However. Big one. The doc witch he is the subject of made last year, rated 8.4, snubbed by the Oscars. Is far superior."
"Such a fuzzy feel-good heartwarming film, like putting on Mr. Rogers' big red sweater. The screenplay is incredibly well written in its approach and Tom Hanks is absolutely perfect as his sixth cousin.Unfortunately by the second half of the film, the sweater unravels into formulaic melodrama so structured that you realize you already knew the beats of the film from the very first scene. It avoids going full Ron Howard and keeps a small-world feel, but it never really achieves legitimate poignancy outside of the one-on-one scenes with Hanks.A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood humanizes a saintly hero into an ordinary humble man to help us realize just how capable we all are of the simple kindness Mister Rogers exemplifies. A family film worth watching for the golden moments, the nifty score, and a tender performance from Tom Hanks. Go see it with a friend in need of inspiration and a cup of peppermint hot chocolate."
