"This is what cinema is supposed to be! Amazing chemistry and acting by both leads, seamless CGI and practical effects to enhance the film, a firecracker script, a true story, pulse pounding soundtrack, booming sound mix, and edited so well that 2.5 hours flies by! Completely and utterly engaging . So good in fact I saw it twice within 24 hours . Once in Imax and once in Dolby cinema ."
"Rating 10/10
Inspired movie of the year. It is wonderfully made. A good story well told. Tightly written, well acted and directed. I hope Matt Damon and Christian Bale can winning an oscar awards because he already deliver the character very well. Thank you to all of you because make it this movie so amazing . A masterpiece !!"
"I was at the Philadelphia Film center premiere on 11/11/19 to view this terrific movie. At the age of 68 and a tifoso of Ferrari since age 8, ( 1959 ), this movie hit a nerve. Truth vs Fiction. This was a David vs Goliath movie, however Goliath wins. The movie recreates a golden era of auto Racing. It was seriously dangerous with death and injury a guarantee at every race. These drivers were absolute warriors and we're fearless. Now Ferrari winning LeMans six straight years in a row from 1960-1965 is actually the David in this movie. Ferrari for all their dominant winning form was still a tiny company that sold fancy $15,000 sportcars to support his racing team. Winning LeMans was a $16,500 team prize. These Ferrari drivers were salaried. The prototype class at that time was wide open with no upper limit on engine size. There was an under 2 liter class that Porsche and Ferrari dino control, but the over 2 liter was unlimited. I read carefully about the Ford move to acquire Ferrari, as daily news reports would cross the associated press. The movie is spot-on about Ford cars lacking desire back then. Chevrolet had the Corvette, Corvair and sporty looking Impala and Chevelle. Now Ford is the Goliath in this movie. They are the big corporate giant with unlimited resources. Ford paid for the Ford GT. It was really a Lola Gt with a Ford badge put on it. Ford put their name on every innovation provided by all the racing/equipment suppliers that went into that race car. Unlike Ferrari being designed, engineered and built handmade in that Italian factory. Ford spent more money on developing a racecar than the total price to buy Ferrari outright. Hired every Nascar team to provide expert pit crews, engine builders and offered 80,000-100,000 to each driver for one race . Now the movie, it's a movie that non race cars fans can and will enjoy. It shows how Shelby and Miles are really the heroes of the winning team. This was true. Their relationship is spot on in the movie and they know what is needed to win. They battle off the track against Ford executives and against Ferrari on the track. What is not disclosed in the movie is the quitting of the Ferrari ace driver John Surtees. When he left Ferrari, the team was devastated. He along with Ford's Ken Miles were two true warriors. Also not shown but lightly covered in the movie is the three years of disastrous outing for the Ford racing team. Did Shelby steal the Ferrari pits stop watches? Did Shelby actually throw spear lug nuts into the Ferrari pit lane to make the Ferrari pit crew think that the race car was missing a nut on the car out on the track? Did Enzo Ferrari actually tip his hat to honor Ken Miles? Who really knows. Everybody is dead. I remember the lug nut rumour in the 1960s, as that was a southern stock car trick. I never heard about the theft of Ferrari stop watches by Shelby. As far as Ferrari tipping his hat. Ferrari was known for or not attending many races. All that aside, did I as a Ferrari fan enjoy this movie. My answer is a Yes, Yes, Yes. With the exception of James Garner in Grand Prix, this is the best movie to deal with the sport of autoracing. Bonus is that it is also a great human interest story and they create the mood of the sixties as U vividly remember it. I rate this movie a ten and should be nominated for Oscars."
"Just saw F v F at the Telluride Film Festival and it is phenomenal. Perfect performances, incredible visuals and editing, immersive sound, and a riveting story. A real winner. Christian Bale lost 70 pounds Defoe the role and is a delight. Damon is spot on. Catriona Balfe is excellent. All the actors playing Ford executives are excellent as well. Masterful direction from James Mangold. A must see."
"Biopics can be a hard sell at times. Whether you're diving into the troubled life of an addict or exploring someone's sexuality, there are many touchy subjects these days. With that said, I feel there are also those that will stand the test of time, in terms of being able to please a wide audience. Ford v Ferrari is one of the latest true stories out of Hollywood that will be hitting the big screen soon, and here's why I believe it absolutely deserves attention.Following multiple characters throughout, Ford v Ferrari focussed on the fact that Henry Ford II was given an idea to create the fastest race car in the world. His mission is to take down the likes of the company Ferrari, who have held the title for years. Carol Shelby (Matt Damon) is approached by a member of the Ford team and is recruited, only to be the one finding himself recruiting the driver in Ken Miles (Christian Bale). That's the core premise and there's a lot to dive into from there.If you're a fan of racing or cars in general, this movie will be for you. This is a very well-directed film by James Mangold, and the racing sequences are quite long, taking up a good chunk of the nearly 150-minute run time. Luckily, they are very intense, practically shot, with a fantastic score to back it up, and sound effects to get your heart pumping. Everything about the exciting aspects of this film was top notch.Christian Bale and Matt Damon give stellar performances here as the two leading men in the film and I totally bought their rigid friendship that slowly developed. Sadly, without giving anything away, there is an incident that I feel was not explored enough, which slightly took away when a certain moment is meant to impact the movie. Other than that, this is a fantastic movie from beginning to end.In the end, Ford v Ferrari is engaging, emotional, and downright thrilling when it wants to be. I was invested in these characters and on the edge of my seat during the climactic races. I thoroughly enjoyed my experience with this movie. There is a missed opportunity in terms of emotion during a certain scene, but I was able to forgive that, seeing as the rest of the movie was so impressive. Ford v Ferrari is one of the best movies I've seen so far this year and it will be one to see when it officially releases."
"A lot of notes were hit by Ford v Ferrari. The characters are fleshed out very well and give you the emotional attachment you're looking for in a movie. Bale and Damon's performances are great; they pull you into the story and completely disappear into their roles. James Mangold proves, once again, to be a master behind the camera. The action scenes are shot to perfection and will have you biting your nails.The film's technical aspects were top-notch as well. Wait for this film to be nominated for sound design and editing. These technical aspects, during the climax of the film, will blow your hair back and give you goosebumps.All in all, this film provides a pleasing experience for the crowd that not many films can even come close to delivering. I loved about every second of it, despite its long runtime."
"I attended the screening at Fox Studios yesterday and It was so good I want to see it again in IMAX. Christian Bale deserves an Oscar nom and definitely so far, the Best Film of the Year!"
"When you think of great sports movies, Rocky, Remember the titans and Rush comes to your mind. This movie won't be know as the best sports movie of all time but would surely be among the top 20. Everything that needs to be said has already been said about the two leading stars in the movie but big shout out to the supporting cast including Jon Bernthal who was great.The story is good but it's a biographical drama so not much can be changed even though there were few liberties were taken with few facts that were presented.The sound design was excellent which made your heart race faster when you heard the roar of the Ford GT 40!Cinematography by Phedon (who was also the cinematographer for the pursuit of happiness) gives us some nice shots of the race which immerses you into action.I got to watch it as part of secret preview show! It will get few Oscar nominations but doubt it would claim any big prize.
Solid 9 out of 10 for me. A must watch if you are a racing fan or a fan of good sports movie."
"Jesus Christ - Bale does it again.Great script, great casting, incredible acting from everyone, but especially Bale."
"The Actors were magnificent, fit their characters so well. They're performances added so much to the movie.The story, which obviously is a true tell was emotional and I recommend not looking into anything before seeing the film if you don't know already. Though I'm sure if you know the story you'll still enjoy it.Shot well too. Highly recommend this film."
"You have to have a big dump in your pants if all you're gonna do is complain about ""historical inaccuracies"" of a movie. Extremely entertaining film. Great cast, fun movie. Bale crushes it per usual."
Both Matt Damon and Bales performances were fantastic and brilliantly directed by James ( by far his best directed film to date!)Along with the excellent duo Oscar worthy performances the racing sequences were upmost beautifully made along with the films cinematography!Im fully confident and expecting multiple Oscar nominations on all fronts for this joyful movie!!
"Based on A.J. Baime's Go Like Hell: Ford, Ferrari, and Their Battle for Speed and Glory at Le Mans (2009), written by Jason Keller, Jez Butterworth, and John-Henry Butterworth, and directed by James Mangold, Le Mans '66 (released in North American with the equally generic title of Ford v Ferrari) counts Michael Mann as an executive producer. This is notable, as Mann himself has been trying to bring an adaptation of Brock Yates's Enzo Ferrari: The Man, the Cars, the Races (1991) to the screen since at least 1993. Indeed, at one point, Mann's Enzo Ferrari was set to star Christian Bale, before he was replaced with Hugh Jackman. Whether or not it will ever be made is open to speculation, but it seems unlikely in the wake of Mann's involvement with Le Mans '66, an excellently made but unadventurous movie.Mangold is a fine director, but he's no Mann, nowhere near, and the film did, to a certain extent, leave me pondering what kind of kinetic brilliance Mann would have brought to similar material. In contrast to Mann's body of work, Le Mans '66 could never be accused of breaking any new ground or trying anything especially original - it hits all the beats, it hits them well, but it never strays from the formula. Looking at issues such as friendship, male pride, personal integrity, sticking it to the Man, art v commerce, individuals v corporations; it is, in essence, a thematically broad and aesthetically anonymous pre-auteur theory audience-pleaser made with the technology and aesthetic sensibilities of modernity. And whilst the individual parts may be unsatisfactorily safe and familiar, the whole is unexpectedly accomplished and immensely enjoyable.The film begins in 1959 as Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) wins that year's Le Mans, only to be told he has a heart condition and must stop racing. Cut to 1963, and Henry Ford II (a superb Tracy Letts, who steals every scene he's in) has just had an offer to purchase Ferrari rejected and been personally insulted by Ferrari himself (Remo Girone). Livid, Ford II determines to build a car capable of winning Le Mans, which Ferrari has won in 1958, 1960, 1961, 1962, and 1963. Ford Vice President and General Manager Lee Iacocca (Jon Bernthal) contacts Shelby, the last non-Ferrari driver to have won the event, and asks him to design a car. He gets to work but says they'll need a great driver as well as a well-designed car. He reaches out to Ken Miles (Bale), who has a reputation as one of the best drivers in the world, and is renowned for his almost supernatural ability to identify problems in test cars after only one or two laps. However, because of his volatility and unpredictable personality, few want to work with him. He comes on board, but immediately clashes with the Ford executives, particularly Senior Executive Vice President Leo Beebe (Josh Lucas).Le Mans '66 is somewhat similar to Michael Mann's Ali (2001), insofar as it uses the grandiose moments of history to tell an intimate story - Mangold uses the determination to win Le Mans '66 as the background against which to examine issues such as friendship and the clash between gifted individuals for whom success is its own reward and corporations who don't see value in anything unless it's monetarily successful. Indeed, the argument could be made that the film is actually a commentary on the Hollywood studio system, with Shelby and Miles representing independent filmmakers who love the craft and see the medium as an art-form, whilst the Ford executives represent the studio, always more concerned with the bottom dollar than artistic integrity, always getting in the way of the people who, if left alone to work, could produce something spectacular (we'll ignore the fact that the whole thing feels like it was made by an algorithm designed to hit as many clichéd feel-good moments as possible).The film is also extremely funny in places, especially in a scene where Shelby shows up at Miles's house, and the two get into a fight on the street. Miles's wife Mollie (an underused Caitriona Balfe) emerges from the house, looks at the two men fighting, goes back inside, and remerges with a garden chair, a drink, and a copy of Better Living. She then sits down to watch the action. It's a hilarious moment, but it's one with great thematic importance - this is very much an androcentric world (Mollie is virtually the only female in the entire film), but for this brief moment, the audience is allowed to pull back and laugh at the utter ridiculousness of competitive maleness - boys will be clichéd boys, always trying to outdo each other, and getting all worked up over something as pointless as a fast car.This thematic focus, however, is not to say the film ignores the intricacies of racing; on the contrary, there's a huge amount of techno-babble concerning vectors, aerodynamics, the mathematics of torque, the torsion of metal, and the ins and outs of physics. Additionally, although thematically, the focus isn't on the races themselves, there's no denying that the aesthetic design of these scenes is exemplary, albeit familiar. Mann would have done wonders here, but Mangold, cinematographer Phedon Papamichael, and sound designers David Giammarco and Jay Wilkinson have crafted some truly intense moments. For the most part, Mangold and Papamichael avoid any objective shots (for example, there are no overheads giving us a good vantage of the entire race), and there are very few shots showing us something that Miles is unable to see. The scenes aren't shot in the first-person, but our vision is anchored to his. This, of course, contributes to a subjective focalisation and creates the sense of being in the car with him, which brings a default level of intensity, as well as giving the viewer a perfect vantage point from which to see just how fast these guys are going and how difficult what they do actually is.In terms of problems, there are only two of significance. The first concerns just how safe and rudimentary the film is. Aesthetically, although the race scenes are kinetic and exciting, there isn't anything new or inventive in them; thematically, the film doesn't say anything we haven't heard before; and structurally, it walks a very well-worn path - chances are that everything that you think might happen in Le Mans '66 does happen. This is your basic underdog story, and it adheres rigidly to that template. The character of Beebe is a good example of just how rigidly. In essence, he's a poorly written token villain because you can't have an underdog story without a token villain (usually in the form of bureaucratic interference). In this case, when Mangold feels the need to inject some conflict into proceedings, Beebe will pop up to throw a wrench into the works. His motivation? Apart from some brief references to how he doesn't think Miles is a ""Ford man"", his antipathy is never explained - the character is a Swiss army knife villain who can be used for multiple purposes, a one-size-fits-all bad guy without an iota of nuance or interiority. The second problem concerns Shelby himself, who is disappointingly one-dimensional (at best), as we learn absolutely nothing about his personal life - for example, the film makes no reference to the fact that by 1963 he was on wife number three (of seven!). Who is the film's Carroll Shelby, and why should non-racing fans care about him? We never get an answer - he's Matt Damon wearing a Stetson and speaking with a Texas drawl. And that's about all the character development he gets.Although these issues are significant in isolation, the thing about Le Mans '66 is that it's so well made, it rises above the clichéd and overly-familiar nature of many of the individual scenes, resulting in a whole that is very much more than the sum of its parts. A film about friendship and integrity rather than racing, it doesn't take any risks, nor does it bend any rules. Indeed it does nothing that could be labelled innovative. For all that, however, I couldn't help but enjoy it. It won't surprise you, it probably won't move you, it certainly won't change your life, but the storytelling is clear and refined, and the journey is one well worth taking."
"Nice surprise at the Cineworld secret screening with this. Bale and Damon have great chemistry. I struggled with Bale's UK Northern accent occasionally, but a story of risk, achievement and friendship, with some great driving scenes. Would recommended, especially for any race fans.
8/10"
Honestly I went to watch this movie with zero expectation and knowledge of the plot. The film is a history of Le Mans '66 told with a thrill ride from Bale and Damon with stunning visual racing scenes. James Mangold has done a fantastic job as a director. Worth the watch in a movie theater.
"Ford V Ferrari is one of the best movies I've seen this year, and for someone who has little interest in cars besides minivans and SUVs, that's saying a lot. Just like the race cars produced by its namesakes, Ford v. Ferrari is sleek and fast; a powerful and expensive machine. A supremely well-balanced combination of corporate rivalry, on-track competitiveness and human drama."
"Le Mans '66 is a fast paced thrill ride from beginning to end. It tells the story of how carol shelby and ken miles built a car that could beat Ferrari in 24hr race at Le Mans where they had won the previous 4 years. The biggest strength in this film is the chemistry between the cast, good performances all round from Josh Lucas to Ray McKinnon but the whole film hinges on the chemistry between the two leads. it delivers on that front with the highlights of the film being scenes with Damon & Bale genuinely feeling like two old friends bantering back & forth about cars. Matt Damon does a great job as Shelby but can't help be overshadowed by Christian Bale who steals the movie with his performance as ken miles a man on the journey to find that one perfect lap. James Mangold does a good job with the direction you feel the gear shifts & the tension when the Ford Gt40 screeches it's breaks around right corners. There could probably more ambitious or creative shots in some of the races but in my honest opinion I think the performances Mangold got out of this cast outshines the technical stuff. The writing isn't the best and can come off as cheesy & predictable in certain areas but for the most part I felt it was well written and had a good pace to it. I'd recommend Le Mans '66 it's not 1st place but it's a near perfect lap."
"Despite the love affair cinema has had with cars over the years, the sport of motor racing on film has been patchy. Too often the drama on the track has been deluged with melodrama off the track, as in John Frankenheimer's ""Grand Prix"" from 1966. While recent efforts such as Ron Howard's ""Rush"" have brought modern filming techniques to better convey the speed and excitement, it is Steve McQueen's ""Le Mans"" from 1971 that had previously set the bar for realism in the sport. But even there, there were a few off-track love stories to interweave into the action.I wouldn't hesitate to suggest that ""Le Mans '66"" is a strong contender for the motor racing high-water mark.The film was marketed as ""Ford v Ferrari"" in the US. (What... do the American distributors think their film-goers are so stupid that if ""Le"" is in the title they will think it sub-titled foreign language??). But it's a valid title, since the movie tells the true story of when Henry Ford... the second... (Tracy Letts) throws his toys out of the pram at Ford's faltering progress. (""James Bond does not drive a Ford"". ""That's because he's a degenerate!"" snaps back Ford, which kind of typifies the problem""). Marketing man Lee Iacocca (Jon Bernthal) persuades retired hot-shot racer Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) to take Ford's blank-cheque to build a car to win the Le Mans 24 hour race.Shelby enlists maverick Brit racer Ken Miles (Christian Bale) to help design and drive the next-generation machine. But neither had banked on the interference of the hoards of Ford suits, led by VP Leo Beebe (Josh Lucas). An explosion is imminent! And its not just from the over-heated brake pads!What's really odd about this film is how linear the story is. While we get to see the family life of Miles (to add necessary context to what follows) these are merely minor diversions. There are no sub-plots or flashback scenes. It just relates the history from beginning to end, enlivened by some of the best and most exciting motor-racing footage put to celluloid.At a bladder-testing 152 minutes, this really shouldn't have worked. I should have got bored and restless. But I really didn't.In many ways - bladders aside - I think this will appeal in particular to an older breed of movie-goer. It's a 100% 'sit back in your seat and enjoy' cinema treat.This is the first film Matt Damon and Christian Bale have made together, and I understand that Damon specifically signed on since he wanted to work with Bale. And there is palpable chemistry there. The movie includes one of the best 'bad-fights' since Colin Firth and Hugh Grant locked horns in the Bridget Jones films. And Damon - never one of the most expressive actors in the world - here really shines.Bale also appears to be having a whale of a time. Not having to adopt a US accent suits him, as he blasts and swears his way through various UK-specific expletives that probably passed the US-censors by! He often tends to play characters in movies that are difficult to warm to, but here - although suitably spiky and irascible - the family man really shines through and you feel a real warmth for the guy.There's a strong supporting cast behind the leads, with Tracy Letts' fast-driving breakdown being a standout moment. I wonder how many takes they needed on that for Damon to keep a semi-straight face?! Also impressive as the son Peter Miles is Noah Jupe. If you're wondering where the hell you've seen him before, he was young (Marcus in ""A Quiet Place"").Where the film comes alive is on the track, and a particular shout out should to to the technical teams. Cinematography is by Phedon Papamichael (""Walk the Line""), film editing is led by Andrew Buckland and Michael McCusker. And sound mixing - which to my ear was piston-valve perfect - is by Steven Morrow. Also worthy of note is a kick-ass driving soundtrack by Marco Beltrami that genuinely excited. These categories are fearsomly hard to predict in awards season, but you might like to listen out for those names.If I was going to pick at any faults in the film, it would be that Ford exec Leo Beebe is painted a little too much as a ""boo-hiss"" pantomime villain in the piece. It could have been perhaps toned down 20% or so.James Mangold (""Logan""; ""Walk the Line"") directs in style. From the rather po-faced trailer, you might think this is a ""car movie that's not for me"". But it really is a tremendously fun movie, with some genuinely laugh-out-loud moments mixed in with edge-of-your-seat action and some heart-rending moments.Above all, this is a film that really benefits from the wide-screen and sound-system that only a big cinema can provide. As such this goes on my ""get out and see it"" list without any hesitation! It's going to make my movies of the year: and I'm off to see it again on Saturday!(Read the full graphical review on One Mann's Movies on the web or Facebook. Thanks)."
"I used to race cars, still spend a bit of time on the track, so I know this story,
even met some of the actual people involved here (I'm old), and I wanted to really like the movie more than I did. Of course the car porn was fantastic, the casual way in which iconic multi-million dollar cars were placed around the set and even some of the scenes showing the GT40 moving around the airport tarmac were very good. For the latter, they captured speed well here, which is very difficult. So, kudos. But the actual danger involved, although shown to some extent, was not given the attention really needed. I understand the dramatic demands for a movie, but I would think emphasizing the danger would only help. Just to be clear, there were two deaths in a five month period, Miles and Macdonald, although deaths and massive injuries were very common then, these deaths actually had an effect on the racing community. Also, to be clear, the Ford effort was massive, they simply hired the very best in the US to get the GT40 developed. It really was a huge disparity between Ford and any other team. In reality, once Ford got out the kinks, it was a foregone conclusion, no matter that Ferrari made amazing cars. In this regard, little was made of the genius and absolute necessity of Phil Remmington to the entire GT40 project, he was the actual development lead on the car and he was made out to be a Disney -like character, uncle Phil with almost no real role to play. Well, actually, the character of Miles, also an engineer on the project was a compiled character that included ""Rem"" but because Rem was the essential piece for GT40 development, they had to gesture towards him, I suppose. Again, it was an okay movie, very much in the genre, although a bit better acted, Damon and Bale fighting with each other, using food, a thrown wrench, the supportive, loving wife. Within the context of a buddy movie, the movie does work, but its too long and you feel it, although I did like the way Miles death accident was shown, not a lot of buildup, save for the music, and then a highspeed muffled crash, no huge histrionics after and then the both true and movie cliche line ""sometimes they don't come home."" I wanted more of the internal mechanics of that, I wanted more of Henry Ford crying in the car, a great scene, actually because both the absolute insanity of being in a racing car as well as his joy were conveyed, I thought that was a magnificent human moment, unexpected and worth the movie, on it's own."
"Once in a while, a big Hollywood film is made with big Hollywood stars, and big Hollywood production values and occasionally everything works to deliver a dynamic cinematic event.
Such is the case with director James Mangold's new film ""Ford v Ferrari"". Armed with superior talent in front and behind the camera, Mr. Mangold has directed his best film yet with bravado. A strong screenplay is the foundation of a great story involving the characters portrayed by Matt Damon playing American Car Designer Carroll Shelby, driver Christian Bale, and Tracy Letts as Henry Ford II, all involved in challenging the famous Italian car maker Ferrari at the famous race at Le Mans in 1966.
From the very first frame, James Mangold sets the tone with exciting, bold and energetic images that are visually arresting, alongside a great score that never overwhelms or feels generic. The editing is outstanding, as the pace is so fast moving, pulsating with nail biting excitement, especially in the racing sequences.
Cinematographer Phedon Papamichael, along with Production Designer Francois Audouy, and Costume Designer Daniel Orlandi, have created a rich canvas, always authentic in feel, full of subtleties resulting in a formidable palette that comes together beautifully.
Flawless performances are a high point under the guidance of James Mangold's direction. Matt Damon has rarely had the opportunity to show quite a range from confidant showman to a vulnerability we rarely see. Christian Bale as always disappears into his character and delivers another stellar performance, and Tracy Letts layers his performance with strength and flair.
Ultimately, James Mangold's master work delivers on all fronts, and on the whole one of the most satisfying films of the year, and certain to be a major contender for many well deserved awards !"
Excellent acting by the entire cast. The race scenes convey the power and danger of the races.
"Decided to make an account and write this review just because how much I liked the movie, the acting was spot on and so was the cinematography.
watch the movie, you won't regret it."
I generally don't enjoy going to the movies anymore since I can wait a few months and watch on our big screen in the comfort of my own home but I was excited to see this movie. We saw it the day it opened in our local theater and I was not disappointed. What a great film. Damon and Bale were fantastic from beginning to end. The characters were very well developed and you actually felt like you knew these guys! The whole cast was phenomenal. I'm not much of a race car fan but this movie had suspense and humor that made it entertaining for everyone! Well done!!
"Not a massive fan of motor racing or motor racing movies but i did enjoy this.
The major asset for the film is the cast, Matt Damon is very good but the real star of this is the fantastic Christian Bale, a superb performance from a great actor.
The story of an unsung British hero, a very modest and a very real hero, he did really drive a tank in WW2, is a tale very much worth telling.
It is long bit flies by - go see."
"This movie has as much traction and grip, as the car that won Le Mans 66!Another stunning performance by Christian Bale (without any body transformation this time!) and the same goes for Jon Bernthal! Yes, this movie might be 20mins to long, but it takes you on a long and exciting ride with an end you won't see coming, unless you spoil yourself with how the race in '66 ended - my advice: DON'T! it will pay off.I'm a Formula 1 enthusiast and occasionally watch the Le Mans races as well, so I wasn't aware how the race in '66 ended. I wasn't even aware of the rivalry between Ford and Ferrari back then, but this movie won't bore you with the details to much. It gives the necessary overview of the needed context, so that every viewer understands what's on the line here.I'd recommend a viewing in an IMAX for sure, to feel the sound and experience the race for yourself. Much like Rush, this movie manages to get the excitement of racing transformed to the audience, without focussing on any crashes or the (back then) still live threatening motorsport."
"You know the best part of the whole movie? It's not Bale, Damon or the cars. They and the cars are already on the respected list. It's the ""background music"". Every time BGM began, it pumped me up. My adrenaline rush felt amazing. It makes any car/bike enthusiast, respect their ride. I had some good cars and I'm missing them all so much right now. Returning back home from the movie, the music in my car was all the way to the sky and I sat for another few mins in the car even after reaching my destination. This is what the movie did to me.Peace out!"
"Outstanding acting, Great movie very refreshing to watch, watch this twice rather than watching Charlie's angels."
"One hell of a ride, your heart will beat and race faster while watching this movie especially if you are a fan of racing cars or etc. Directed by James Mangold (Logan, Walk the Line). Based on true story about American automotive designer Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) and British race car driver Ken Miles (Christian Bale), together they plan to compete against the race cars of Enzo Ferrari at the 24 Hours of Le Mans in France in 1966. The story itself was so emotional and adrenalin pumping, I'd really recommend if you haven't know the story yet before watching this movie. I'm not really a fan of racing cars but I'm not disappointed either with this one, either you fan or not- you'll enjoy this movie.It's not just about the cars even the race or the business, that's why I liked this movie. It is personal, heartfelt, and touching. With all the long racing scene it won't even bore you, I wasn't even know before about the rivalry between Ford and Ferrari back then but big bravo on the writer and director, the racing scenes had me sitting up on the edge of my seat! This movie manages to get the audience feel the excitement and thrill of racing. A strong screenplay with phenomenal performance by Christian Bale and Matt Damon, not to mention other supporting actors like Noah Jupe and Josh Lucas. The chemistry between Bale and Damon is engaging, their characters fit so well.Solid movie from start to finish, I'd really recommend you to watch it with IMAX. One of the best movies for this year. The ending may wasn't explored enough but if you know the real story, you might know why it wasn't explored enough. It is for the best I guess."
"Few movies I will pay the expense of going to see because of the high prices of theaters these days. This is one of those films. Just came back and must say. It delivered! Well thought out and told. Matt and Christian as always shined in this project. In my personal opinion Matt & Christian are two of our times greatest actors. They don't play a role, they live it. Go see this feature. You wont be disappointed. it's a great story that needed to be told, and in the hands of those two. Well worth your time. 5 Stars*****!"
"Laugh, cry, get the feels, this movie has it all. Christian bale shines as always and Matt damon loves chewing gum. I wonder what kind of gum he was chewing for 78% of the movie. Anyway it was great I just thought that was funny. If you love cars it's a plus. I almost skeeted my pants like 4 times during this movie."
"""There's a point at 7000 RPM where everything fades. The machine becomes weightless. It disappears. All that's left, a body moving through space and time. At 7000 RPM, that's where you meet it. That's where it waits for you.""Incredible movie! 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼 I've always loved car racing & this film that tells about the events in the 3 years leading up to & the actual 1966 24 hours of Le Mans race that showcases the rivalry between Ford & Ferrari totally brings home the trophy. Well written, acted, directed, edited, etc. it's the whole damn package. What heart & soul Christian Bale pours into the role of sports car racing engineer & driver, Ken Miles, with Matt Damon as Carroll Shelby (automotive designer & race car driver) coming in with a very close second. Great supporting cast with Jon Bernthal as the famous Lee Iacocca, Josh Lucas as Leo Beebe, Ray McKinnon as Phil Remington, Caitriona Balfe as Mollie Miles, & Tracy Letts as Henry Ford II. Not once in its 2 & a half hour run time did I get bored.The score by Marco Beltrami & Buck Sanders drove the movie just right & even has a track called ""7000 RPM"".Well done & major kudos all around. I predict some Oscar noms for this.."
"Matt Damon, Christian Bale and Caitriona Balfe thoroughly inhabit their characters - that's the best thing about this movie, I think. Each of them has multiple scenes in which they are alternately charming and sympathetic. I was a teen when the historical events depicted in the movie occurred, and I remember some of them, which made this especially interesting to me. Occasionally the film falters when it succumbs to cliche, for example when it depicts the relentless efforts of Henry Ford II's kissing, sniveling right-hand man to undermine our heroes. But when the focus is in the lead characters and the road racing, it's a strong pic. I recommend it, especially if you have any interest in international racing history."
"Ford v Ferrari was really a great movie. Just solid on all levels. Great script, acting, and story was told in a really great way. The driving sequences were really exciting and felt like we were there on the race track. Enjoyed this one alot!"
One of the best movies I've seen this year. A reminder that not all modern movies suck.
"Ford V Ferrari (Director. James Mangold)James Magild once again delivers us another bloody great film. Ford v Ferrari is wild and thrilling film which I seriously did it expect to enjoy so much.At 153 minutes, the pacing honestly flies by. I wouldn't say it needed trimming down at all. The whole film is a load of fun, thanks to brilliant performances, a great script and racing scenes which are brilliantly directed and filled with so much energy. The last race is honestly so well done, it is one of the best film moments of the year. The visual effects are for the most part spectacular. Even the more drama scenes are still just as interesting.
Also ther racing scenes are downright brilliant with their sound mixing and editing.
Christian Bale once again proves he is one of the best actors of this generation. He alone makes the film worth watching. Noah Jupe, Matt Damon, Jon Berthnal and the rest of the cast are so amazing as well.
Overall it's one of the most energetic and memorable films of the year. Mangold is such an ace director and his talent really shines here. It's a really stylish film and such a likeable film and definitely worth watching.Overall Rating: A-"
"I went into Ford v Ferrari a little unsure, as I'm not a huge racing fan, and wondered if the movie might be boring to me. My worry was unfounded - Ford v Ferrari is the best movie I've seen all year. It's surprisingly funny, completely engaging, historically accurate, and now my favorite Christian Bale movie. In fact, you'll forget you're watching Matt Damon and Christian Bale as they both completely disappear into their characters. So no spoilers here, just a recommendation to go see a great movie."
"The Movie is brilliantly edited With an all cast Christian Bale & Matt Damon together its a perfect match for likeness of their characters. Matt Damon has certainly grown as an actor with versatility and we all know Christian Bale Becomes any character he portrays and is well suited to play another amazing man, Ken Miles. I love how they showed us the true Politics of the Motor Industry. Great true story, but as a Ford lover, Ford couldn't see the Forest through the trees! If wasn't for Miles And even then!!!"
"If you're unfamiliar with the titular race, you won't slip behind. Le Mans '66 requires no prior interest in the sport in the same way that you don't need to be a boxing fanatic to enjoy Rocky. At heart, it's a character piece; a platonic romance between two men best able to express themselves behind the wheel. Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon, affable as ever) is a former racerturned-car designer. In the '60s he's hired by Ford to head up the ailing motor company's morale-boosting effort to win the famous 24 Hours Of Le Mans endurance race. And, more specifically, to beat the reigning Ferrari team while doing so.
Shelby brings in his buddy Ken Miles (Christian Bale) not only to help design the vehicle that Ford is betting the farm on, but also to drive it. The aptly named Miles is purely driven by his passion for the automotive arts and an unquenchable need for speed. Wayward Brummie accent aside, it's a lovely, warm performance from Bale. There's the trademark intensity - heightened by his geometrically sharp cheekbones - but here it's in service to a common goal, and a love of the sport. Miles doesn't suffer fools, but there's a sweetness to his family-man side and the sheer thrill he gets from racing, hooting things like ""Giddy-up!"" as he pushes the rev counter to its limit. If Miles is the heart of the team, Shelby's the head, bringing his own racing expertise to bear while also managing the expectations of the suits upstairs, including the irascible Henry Ford II (Tracy Letts) and smarmy marketing type Leo Beebe (Josh Lucas). (There's a barely hidden filmmaking analogy here, as the creative visionaries struggle to keep their ideas on track while placating the needs of the executives.) Throw in Jon Bernthal as another, more amenable, exec and the cast starts to feel a little bloated, especially given that the two-hours-30 runtime is generous for a film on a largely predictable track. Bernthal's good, but did we really need another middle-man in the mix, given that Shelby already occupies that negotiator role?
Le Mans '66 truly roars into life during the racing scenes, particularly the final act show-stopper. The visceral, pulsequickening laps instantly join the canon of great race sequences, and they're a testament to the skill of director James Mangold and his team, equalling the set-pieces in any more obviously 'bankable' blockbusters. But Mangold's film isn't quite as compelling when not behind the wheel of a record-breaking sports car. For one thing, the US title Ford V Ferrari is somewhat misleading - yes, Ford are looking to unseat the Italian giants, but the latter are so little seen that there's never a palpable sense of a head-to-head rivalry. In their minimal screentime, the Italians come across as scowling stereotypes. And on the subject of stereotypes, Outlander's Caitriona Balfe is lumbered with a limited supportive-wife role as Mollie Miles. It's clear she knows her way around an engine, but she's rarely required to do more that squint with concern at a radio while her husband races. The family scenes don't quite get under the skin of Miles' compulsions in the way that First Man explored the more selfish aspects of Neil Armstrong's pursuits. It's on the physical side that Le Mans '66 really delivers - not only in the aforementioned races, but in the lo-fi mechanics, and the pit stops that canon of great race sequences, and they're a testament to the skill of director James Mangold and his team, equalling the set-pieces in any more obviously 'bankable' blockbusters. But Mangold's film isn't quite as compelling when not behind the wheel of a record-breaking sports car. For one thing, the US title Ford V Ferrari is somewhat misleading - yes, Ford are looking to unseat the Italian giants, but the latter are so little seen take an eternity in comparison to modern-day refuelling methods. The film is a visual treat, an expertly crafted piece of sun-burnished Americana, with no shortage of big-screen thrills. Mangold's career to date has seen a mix of straightforward blockbusters (Knight And Day, The Wolverine) and character pieces (Girl, Interrupted, Cop Land, Walk The Line) but, for all its strengths, Le Mans '66 doesn't straddle that divide as effectively as Mangold's last film, Logan, did."
"I have to say, I am a big fan of fast cars. And I am a big fan of Christian Bale and Matt Damon. So this Movie should be good. But this Movie was Awesome! It has it all. You Laugh, you cry and it is exciting!This Movie is not made for Petrolheads only, its a Movie for everyone!"
"Ford v Ferrari thrills by simulating the record-breaking pace of the cars on the tracks, but really captivates because we care deeply about the men trying to make the victory happen.
Before his back-to-back dips into the comic-book universes of Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) and the X-Men - in the films Logan and The Wolverine - James Mangold nimbly danced through genres in search of compelling characters. He'd make a Tom Cruise actioner like Knight & Day, but add on a bumbling innocent character to spice up the routine spy genre. He'd plunge into a conventional biopic like Walk the Line, but reinvent it with the aide of two commanding performance at the head of his Johnny Cash story.
Mangold's back at the helm of a sturdy, red-blooded American story of ingenuity and stick-to-your-guns re-invention for the spectacular new Ford v Ferrari. You've probably seen this type of story told before, but rarely this well, with supreme talents overcoming nearly impossible odds to achieve a goal everyone tells them they can't get.
It's the late 1960s, and Henry Ford II (Tracy Letts) faces a serious issue. The Ford brand, time-tested and baked into the American popular culture, is struggling to contend against an onslaught of cooler, hipper cars. Kids coming back from the war hardly want to plunk down cash on the cars on which their dads used to depend. Ford needs bold, company-saving ideas, and Lee Iacocca (Jon Bernthal) has one.
Iacocca wants Ford to compete on the global racing circuit. Specifically, Iacocca wants Ford to go head-to-head with the dominant force of the international circuit: Enzo Ferrari (Remo Girone). To do that, Ford recruits two men with intimate knowledge of this field: celebrated automotive designer Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon), who raced in and won the annual 24 Hours of LeMans in 1959; and Ken Miles (Christian Bale), a hard-headed and short-tempered grease monkey who has a seamless connection to his automobiles, and might be the only person talented enough to drive the car Ford needs to build from scratch.
Even if you know the results of the 1966 24 Hours of Le Mans - and the outcome has been famous in the race world since the moment the event concluded - Mangold's Ford v Ferrari captivates and entertains with the peaks and valleys of the team's journey. The riveting drama spins a classic narrative of teamwork and ingenuity in the face of stifling adversity, as Shelby and Miles constantly had to convince Ford of the risks that needed to be taken if they actually wanted to win the race, and not just contend.
Mangold recruits two of the greatest male actors working today to play his leads, but they are overshadowed by one intangible co-star I like to call ""speed."" The racing scenes in Ford v Ferrari are breathtakingly innovative, with Mangold and his team routinely figuring out new ways to put us in the driver's seat of some of the fastest vehicles on the planet. The chief obstacle facing Shelby and Miles was making their protoptype race car faster, so the tests performed in the film had to convey that achievement. Ferrari thrills by simulating the record-breaking pace of the cars on the tracks, but really captivates because we care deeply about the men trying to make the victory happen.
Bale, in particular, is fantastic as the flawed and conceited Ken Miles, a dedicated husband and father who can't help but put his passion for cars ahead of the family he loves. He's conflicted by his desire to be around for them, but unable to resist the temptation that comes with the challenge of being right about the cars that Shelby fights to design. Arguably, Ford could not have competed at 24 Hours of Le Mans without Ken Miles' contributions, and I'd shudder to think of a version of Ford v Ferrari without Bale behind the wheel.
Under Mangold's watchful eye, Ford v Ferrari tells a stirring, inspirational story about professional pride, and tells it extremely well. The screenplay creates rich, complicated characters out of its underdog-sport template (though two supporting characters drag the main plot down with their unnecessary contributions), and Mangold's precision for filmmaking helps the ride stay perpetually smooth and swift. Hollywood used to specialize in these audience-bonding crowd pleasers. Now they are few and far between, so when one speeds along and is firing on all cylinders, so out of your way to support it."
A huge disappointment for racing fans ( and who else would watch this sort of film ?). No mention of the original designer of the GT40 Eric Broadley of British car maker Lola on whose GT mk VI the Ford was based. No mention of Denny Hulme who co-drove with Ken Miles. It's as if he didn't exist. WTF ?!The largely hammy acting by Christian Bale also a let down as Miles' brummie accent sounded more like cockney in Bale's portrayal. Really poor dialogue and not even close to the real story. The best thing about the film was the racing machinery used but in the driving sequences a car wouldn't have lasted 5 minutes the way Bale smashed through the gears.Nowhere near the class of the racing classics Grand Prix and Le Mans.
"Ford v Ferrari is a well-made, well-shot film with some very good acting. It is also an utterly boring, predictable, by-the-numbers sports/competition success story, and that is its damning flaw. The plot contains almost conceivable cliche that can be found in this sort of movie, hitting all the usual story beats. A hastily-assembled crew of outcasts being given a seemingly impossible task against an unbeatable sports rival, dealing with their personal problems and struggling against the interference of smug, suited corporate figures who do not like the fact that our heroes are not types who play by the book, and growing as characters along the way. Directing-wise, this plot comes with all the usual accoutrements, the most obvious of which is montages where the team of underdogs progress in their quest.The result is a movie where one can easily guess all the plot points and how the next scene is going to play out. Even the lighthearted, comedic moments happen exactly the way such scenes happen in every other movie of this kind. All of this especially becomes a problem when it is far longer than it should be. And despite the bloated runtime, some story elements somehow remain underwhelming. We know that the main characters are good friends simply because the script pretty much tells us so, but this is not properly set up. Some of the context and the events that drive the story forward are difficult to figure out, although this may be less so for viewers who are familiar with the racing context and the real-life events. In addition, it is sad that for a movie titled Ford v Ferrari, we never really see the events from the Italians' side, who remain bumbling foes beset by their overconfidence throughout the film.All of this is not the say that the movie is not well-made. It is, despite the obvious CGI-y look of some of the racing scenes, and this is pretty much the reason behind my 6/10 score. If you are a diehard racing fan, or -for whatever reason- have never seen a sports/competition movie of this kind, you might really like it. Otherwise, the redeeming qualities of the picture are not enough to save it from being pretty much a total bore."
"Automotive geniuses sell their soul to corporate bureaucracy in effort to develop killer endurance race car. Carroll Shelby, the most beloved car designer in American history, faces the music when it comes to dealing with the Big Boys. His desire for endurance race success coincides with Ford's corporate decision to get racier, inspired by Lee Iacocco (the father of the Mustang). After that it's all individualism vs. corporate bullxxxx. I think Damon is the most reliable star out there, and it's a stretch but not too much of a stretch for him to play country outlaw Shelby. Bale is also stretch but a workable stretch for the equally individualistic Miles, a Brit racer and car designer. Henry Ford II is also magnificently played. The CGI was under control, the movie ran long but not unpleasantly so, the wrap up was a tad awkward but that happens. Appears to have captured the basic facts and feelings of the true life events, for which it deserves kudos. Could be enjoyed by non-racing fans."
"Every year there is a film that has a little bit of everything to please anyone out there. A film that has heart, passion for a craft, strong performers, dreams that become reality - a film worth watching on the big screen, that keeps you entertained for 150 minutes. Well, Ford v Ferrari is that film.American car designer Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) and driver Ken Miles (Christian Bale) battle corporate interference, the laws of physics and their own personal demons to build a revolutionary race car for Ford and challenge Ferrari at the 24 Hours of Le Mans, the world's oldest active sports car race in endurance racing, in 1966.Shelby and Miles aren't doing this for fame or the prize at the end of the finish line, they do it because they love racing, building something from scratch and making it even better than ever thought possible. That's where the heart of this film lies. Just like those guys, you can tell director James Mangold and his team made this film with a passion for filmmaking. From production design, to camera movements in- and outside the race cars, to the attention to detail when it comes to costume design and historic accuracy. A true feat for Hollywood and for cinema goers worldwide.20th Century Fox/Disney does seem to want to attract an audience that's interested in cars and racing, but this film is more than just that. It's about business and family, the message this film tells without any hesitance is universal and will keep everyone intrigued for its entire two and a half hour runtime. There's never a dull moment in this what might seem boring on paper event-film. Even the longest dialogues are riddled with Bale's over-the-top face acting and writers Jez Butterworth, John-Henry Butterworth and Jason Keller made sure to have serious conversations supercharged with dry humour. Bale proves how much of an acting-chameleon he is - I've never seen him do anything like this before. Even Damon, who I'm personally not the biggest fan of, since I find him very one-note, deserves my recognition as being simply incredible as Bale's on screen ""co-driver"".The supporting cast might not be filled with household Hollywood names, but this cast is without a doubt one of the best ensembles you'll see all year. Noah Jupe (A Quiet Place) and Caitriona Balfe (Outlander) as Miles' son and wife will have many viewers look up their names. Jupe has a joyful screen presence that makes you want to protect him at all costs, while Balfe stands her ground with her mesmerising charisma. Her chemistry with Bale feels so naturally intimate, as if they're a married couple in real life - I found myself smiling every time they interacted with each other - magical! Jon Bernthal, Tracy Letts and Remo Girone each give compelling performances in every scene they bump and run.Although I said this wasn't just a movie about racing, it does have the most spectacular race sequences I've seen in years, thanks to Phedon Papamichael's off the charts cinematography, flawless VFX and the amazing sound design team. Following the cars on ground level in hair clip turns is sweat inducing and will have you gasping for clean air when stuff completely goes wrong. There's never a moment you won't believe it's not Bale himself who sits behind the wheel.Ford v Ferrari is the kind of movie everyone will enjoy. It has big Hollywood stars telling a timeless story about friendship and making dreams come true. In a year, full of sequels and remakes, what more do you want? This is one of the most entertaining films you'll see this year."
"One of the best films of the year! Great enlightenment of incredible acting and magic in editing! Christian Bale's performance is a spark of excellence as always, he's one of the best actors in this generation. If I had one complaint it'd be that Matt Damon chews way to much gum but part of me thinks that added on his glorious performance. I really hope Ford Vs. Ferrari gets Oscar praise, it deserves every bit of love."
"Passion, devotion, friendship. Absolute fantastic, fast paced and well written experience from start to finish. Loved the chemistry between the two main characters. Christian Bale was absolutely outstanding, and even though he had done this before, the body transformation from portraying Dick Chaney to Ken Miles still just makes me want to stand up and clap my hands. His determination and commitment to the role is on another level, not achievable to most actors out there. I've read that the main reason Damon wanted to do this movie, was to be able to work with Bale. Seemed like they two knew each other for years and have done dozens of movies together. The fight scene was hilarious!As somebody who didn't know the story at all or have had any interest in Le Mans, the racing footage was excellent and well presented. It really makes you sad when Ken was cheated out of winning it but you can see he didn't care. He wasn't in it for fame.Go and see it on the big screen while you can. It's a hell of a ride at 7000 RPMs!"
"From a production standpoint: this film is bloody brilliant. Expert craftsmanship all around from the photography, editing, acting. I imagine this was a very difficult film to make and was handled with expertise.The screenplay was very disappointing, however.The racing scenes are fantastic, but most of the non-racing scenes are just cookie-cutter and uninspired. If the racing scenes weren't so thrilling and engaging, this movie wouldn't have a leg to stand on. There are certain themes and elements which James Mangold does so well-and you can expect to see them in this film-but they're never really explored with much depth. Themes such as fatherhood, sacrifice, independence in spite of authority, what a man must do to take care of his family, a child's expectations of their father; all of these are just lifeless, dead on arrival.There's one female character in the film and she gets to sit at home and be the supportive wife to Christian Bale's character. That said, this is one of Christian Bale's best performances. He steals every scene he's in-but, unfortunately he only is ever given the same 3 beats to play. How many times can you watch him get angry when someone tells him he can't do something? Entertaining as it may be, it grows stale after a while.The two-and-a-half-hour run time feels like three. Fantastic editing not withstanding, at least thirty minutes of the film could have cut. Cut this film down by thirty minutes, and you have a serious Oscar contender. Keep it the way it is, and you have a real letdown of what could have been one of the year's best."
"Nothing really surprising or deep here, by the numbers script, showing the all-american cliches: manly American men, each more charismatic and talented than a hundred Italian men, their loving and hot American housewives, great professionals at wonderful Ford, etc. You know: USA Is No. 1. Yaaawn."
"It is inherently uninteresting. A mega corporation gives a blank check to win a race, and they do. The film's crime however is it won't commit to this-Americanism is unfashionable today, so it wants it both ways, they're soulless villains same time as the Italians are othered bordering on Red Dawn-esque (for the crime of being a competent boutique car company?) Similar to First Man they hope no one will notice the misfire. Plus too many scenes of life lessons and a trademark killjoy biopic wife extend this half an hour too long...how many times can they bring out the exact same scene of Josh Lucas being a jerk or the wife being movie-wifey? But that is a great Christian Bale performance. He knows exactly how to register and where to pinpoint every beat. He's like the ultimate older brother. It's an example where good taste should have brought others into its wavelength, expanding why what he was doing worked and pulling the monotonous and contrived Josh Lucas nonsense they hammer into the ground scene after scene."
"If you know bugger all about racing and don't care about an avalanche of Hollywood cliches, I'm sure you will love this. It's beautiful, Bale and Damon are wonderful as always, the sound it wonderful and there are more than one funny scene that made me laugh.However, if you are interested in racing and Le Mans, you will find this toe curling. First of all because of all the cliches are just standing in line for the full length of the movie. Most of all the ever-present protagonist-driver-changes-gear-and-reveals-that-he-hadn't-floored-the-accelerator-until-now stupidity. In fact they repeat this once every five minutes. And of course the drivers' ability to look over at other drivers for seconds at a time while they sit in a race car that does 974 km/h! Oh and of course the Hollywood cliche that never fails: Le Mans drivers that drive like it's stock car racing. Slamming into each other, going off the road intentionally, spinning and crashing out in epic fireballs ... they are all there in their vomit inducing glory. There's the totally unrealistic racing environment, handling of the race cars, driver and pit crew behaviour, a totally unbelievable person gallery and a farcical historical depiction. And of course there is the oh-so-evil suit and tie wearing villains and the oh-so-good heroes, which we are supposed to believe actually existed.Sigh! I felt absolutely nothing for any of the people at the end. Neither for the good guys nor the bad. If you are a racing fan, don't go watch this garbage."
"It's not a bad movie, but it's quite flat and nothing that you haven't seen before. Lacks in epic qualities and in depicting the true dangers of racing in those days. Forgettable soundtrack. See ""Rush"" for a far better outcome on all these aspects. The worst flaw is in the way they filmed the circuit De La Sarthe: first, there's no iconic shot on the Mulsanne straight, that's something I don't understand; secondly, they failed in showing what a grind was driving at 300kmh for three minutes, with a couple of very hard brakes. Also, they didn't show the slower classes of cars racing simultaneously, that were a true hazard. Overall, little remains for racing enthusiasts."
"Maybe it's because we know the race result, so the suspense isnt really there. Some good cinematography but the race sequences are so repetitive."
"Like many American films this title attempts to rewrite history.
The truth is that Ferrari were the complete underdog. What actually happened is that huge behemoth motor company Ford tried to buy the tiny Ferrari and Enzo said no. Ford threw their toys out of the pram and decided to build the GT40. With their limitless budget it took a few years for them to finally succeed at beating the tiny Ferrari company at Le Mans. And even when they did, Ford used a 5 litre engine versus Ferrari's 3 litre.
This film needs remaking to tell what really happened and who the reall heroes were. They would be wearing red overalls thats for sure."
Amazing movie... As usual Christian Bale and Matt Demon are amazing in their characters Ken Miles & Corroll Shellby.... Direction is awesome as well from James Mangold.... On of the best movies I have seen in longtime
"First Hit: I love good car movies, and this one qualifies as one of the best.It's been a while since I've been to a night showing of a film. In picking this evening time and this film, it was both pleasing and irritating to be in a nearly full theater. The fun part is that I often see films where there are less than 15 people in the theater, and seeing an almost full theater gave me hope that others will continue to support going to movie theaters.The irritation part is the noise that people make during the film presentation. Why someone thinks their remembrances of the period, or what they think about what their seeing on the screen is essential to spout out while the film is playing, is beyond me. The gentleman sitting next to me turned around just as I did the same thing and together we asked them to be quiet. It took us doing this twice for them to get that they weren't at home watching cable TV.
Despite the noise interruptions, this film unfolded in a fun way. Remembrances of the 1960s abounded with cars from the era on the streets. Yes, they were perfectly restored vehicles, but it was easy to gloss over the prettiness to enjoy the beauty of those old cars reflecting their time and place in my life. There were Shelby Cobras, Porsches, Ford Falcons, Mini, woody (fake wood) wagons, Ferraris, and Ford GT 40s.The film is about how Enzo Ferrari (Remo Girone) turned down Henry Ford II's (Tracy Letts) offer to buy 90% of Ferrari's car production company. In turning down Ford's offer and partnering with Fiat, Enzo made unflattering remarks about Ford and his cars to the Ford negotiation team. Angered by the personal comments, Ford vowed to beat perennial 24 Hours Le Mans race winner, Ferrari.Chief Ford negotiator, Lee Iacocca (Jon Bernthal), was then tasked with finding a car builder who will build a Ford-based car to beat Ferrari. Finding Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon), the one-time winning driver of the 24 Le Mans, to make the car, Ford believes they found their man. Henry Ford gives Shelby carte blanche to build this car.Shelby, in turn, hires his friend and race car driver Ken Miles (Christian Bale), to be his test driver and co-builder. The main reason is that he can trust Miles as he knows cars and feels their abilities and problems as he drives them. Miles is also creative when figuring out how to make cars work better. The downside of Miles is that he's a maverick in his thinking and hates to conform to rules and being told what to do.Miles is married Mollie (Caitriona Balfe), who's amused by her husband's friendship with Shelby. There are couple scenes that this loving amusement shows up. One thing the film makes clear is that Ken is a loving devoted father who loved showing his son Peter (Noah Jupe) the ins and outs of racing.The film spends time showing Miles and Shelby developing the GT40 to race in Le Mans, but when it comes time to ship the car off to the race, Leo Beebe (Josh Lucas) Senior VP at Ford, chooses another driver to drive the vehicle at the Le Mans race.Shelby is pissed, Miles is severely disappointed, and of course, the new driver doesn't feel the car like Miles would have and ends up blowing it apart during the race.Ford wants to fire Shelby for the failure, but the meeting between Ford and Shelby is fantastic because Shelby convinces Ford that he, Ford, has Ferrari where he wants him, scared. Scared because Shelby's car, with another driver, was faster than the Ferrari, especially on the straightaway at Le Mans. This was a great scene. It's reflecting Shelby's legendary ability to sell anyone on anything.Ford tells Shelby to fix the car and get it ready for the next Le Mans and that Shelby has control over the driver.The rest of the movie shows how they develop a stronger, lighter, faster GT40 car. But when Beebe intercedes again about Miles being the driver at Le Mans, Shelby takes Ford out in the GT40 and scares the crap out of him, literally.
Then at that moment negotiates with Ford to let Miles drive. As part of the deal he offers Ford his Shelby American company if Miles races and loses.It's scenes like this that are fun to watch and reminded me of the time that a friend of a friend, gave me a ride in a Lamborghini Miura, and scared the crap out of me while racing around a sizeable empty factory parking lot at a very high speed.There were sections of this 152-minute film that could have been trimmed, but I was engaged enough to not care about the lulls of uninteresting or engaging material. Other characters added to this story and made better. One such person was Chief Mechanic Phil Remington (Ray McKinnon). His ideas about creating a way to change the brake assembly were brilliant.Bale was intensely and independently outstanding in this role as race car driver Ken Miles. His ability to show tenderness and love towards his family and aggressively focused on making the car faster was terrific. Damon was wonderful as Carroll Shelby. The scene with Ford after the first loss and his fight with Miles in front of Mile's home reflected the off-told stories about the legend of Carroll Shelby. Bernthal was good as the famed Iacocca. Balfe was convincing as Ken's wife. Her support and understanding of her husband were excellently portrayed. My favorite scene shows Balfe driving Ken home while pressing him on his whereabouts. Her focused intensity was sublime. Letts was priceless as Ford II. The bullying ways he used around his staff and factory followed by his being humbled by the spin in the GT40 were terrific. McKinnon was excellent as devoted Chief Mechanic for Shelby. Beebe was appropriately arrogant, self-serving, and sharp as a foil to Shelby's vision. Girone was satisfyingly perfect as Enzo Ferrari. Jez and John-Henry Butterworth wrote an expansive script that could have been shortened and made crisper. However, there are some outstanding scenes in the film. James Mangold directed this film. To his credit, racing scenes can get old quick, but the excellent editing and cinematography made these scenes come alive.Overall: I liked seeing this film for multiple reasons, including that the subsequent Ford built Shelby Mustang GT-350 and GT-500 had parts made by my father's company in the late 1960s."
"Wow, what a movie that was!
The whole thing about this movie is that it's not about racing. If you're expecting a racing movie, better go and watch earlier installments of Fast & Furious franchise. This movie is about a great friendship and one of the most famous rivalries in the history of motorsports. Yes, it is a drama, that tells us a very sad story, that I won't tell now in order to avoid any spoilers.
it's amazing how good were the writers and the director, who managed to make an intense movie for a motorsports fan like myself. Knowing the story in details, I was sitting there an watching the movie living every second of it. Amazing work!
Matt Damon and especially Christian Bale are outstanding.
There are slight differences with the real story, but my guess is that it was done with purpose, to make the story more interesting/dramatic.
Overall one of the new additions to the my favorite movie list.
Go to the cinemas, grab a huge pop corn and enjoy more than 2 hours of an excitig story, some very well done racing sequences, great acting and some very good humor.
10/10 stars."
"Ford v Ferrari is an incredible and thrilling racing drama and in my opinion, one of the best films of the year. Christian Bale and Matt Damon both give incredible performances and they have perfect chemistry, although Christian Bale does steal every scene he is in. Jon Bernthal and Tracy Letts are both great. The pacing is incredible as it does not feel as long as it is. The music by Marco Beltrami is amazing. James Mangold's direction is fantastic and the film is extremely well filmed, resulting in genuinely thrilling racing sequences throughout. It's also surprisingly very funny in certain parts and emotional in others."
"Technically dazzling and well-acted film, but the script is a dull thud. Scenes are often contrived, sometimes exasperingly so, such as when Ken Miles (Christian Bale) explaiins the details of the Le Mans circuit to his son (Noah Jupe), or Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) demonstrates the need for a first-rate driver to Henry Ford II (excellent Tracy Letts). Come on, writers! Couldn't you do better than this?Very much a boy's adventure pic with a slight seasoning of 'vulnerable man' stuff thrown in as a sop to 21st century sensibilities. In the only female role of any consequence, Caitriona Balfe is strong and supportive, but, for all the difference her character makes to the story, she might just as well not be there.In the manner of all films about motor racing (e.g. GRAND PRIX, John Frankenheimer's 1966 movie), the race footage is what it's all about, and some of FORD v FERRARI's is genuinely thrilling. The story that surrounds it, interesting though it is, inevitably seems tame by comparison."
"Having just stepped out of an advanced screening of le Mans 66 or Ford vs Ferrari if you prefer, I was really looking forward to this film and I wasn't disappointed. As a fan of the 24hr race I found the racing scenes to be heart pounding, adrenalin pumping and visually breathtaking. The core performances from Bale as Ken Miles and Damon as Carroll Shelby really sold the film to me as a couple of die hard car fanatics with a complicated friendship put together beautifully by James Mangold in the big chair. It's not just thrills either. There are genuinely touching moments in this film with a great supporting cast and a great villain in Enzo Ferrari. I loved it and if you have an interest in the source material you won't find a better petrol fuelled film this year. SA"
Truly awful. A more appropriate title would be Ford: the meaningless death of Ken Miles. Nothing is done to make any characters meaningful or interesting. Ferrari is absent from the film almost entirely and Italians in general are portrayed as foolish caricatures. Ford management is made to look so dumb it is a wonder the racing program even existed. This movie is not fun or entertaining. Cinematically it is also a dud. I have never been so bored looking at a GT40. The driving sequences are nonsensical and without consequence. Save yourself the embarrassment and watch James May's Grand Tour GT40 film instead.
"There is some really good acting from all the principals in this film, but the direction is slow and shoddy and the script itself calls for too many shots of people changing gears, cars moving around the track, etc. Equally disappointing is the failure to once mention the Corvette, the raison d'etra for the Mustang in the first place."
"I'm no petrolhead. What little knowledge I have of classic cars I gleaned from playing Top Trumps as a kid. I do remember that if you had either the Ford GT40 or a Ferrari card, there was a very good chance of winning the hand, unless, of course, the two cars came up against each other. Then you had to choose wisely.In the mid-'60s, Ford and Ferrari fought it out for real at Le Mans, a road race that lasts almost as long as this film (jk). At a whopping 152 minutes, director James Mangold's biopic is no quick win, but buckle up and sit back for the duration and you will be rewarded with a film that delivers great performances, a gripping tale of determination and courage, and some truly spectacular racing scenes (real or CGI? I couldn't tell).Matt Damon plays car designer Carroll Shelby (the man who gave us the AC Cobra, another good Top Trumps card) who is hired by Ford Motors to help build a car that can beat Ferrari at Le Mans, thereby improving the company's image in the eyes of young Americans and putting the Italians in their place at the same time. Christian Bale is Ken Mills, the man chosen by Shelby to drive the car against the wishes of Ford executive Leo Beebe (Josh Lucas).A classic underdog story, the film follows the team as they design and test the new race-car, experiencing various setbacks along the way (some of which are orchestrated by Beebe, who wants to see Mills fail), before finally making it to France. American viewers will no doubt feel a sense of pride at Ford's remarkable endeavour, but it'll be us Brits who'll be cheering the loudest (at least on the inside), for it is Englishman Ken Miles (a likeable turn from Christian Bale) who is the real hero of the film, pushing himself and the car to the limits.The legendary 24-hour road race itself delivers all the thrills and spills necessary for an edge-of-the-seat finale, with Mills making a mockery of the Ferrari team as promised, but anyone geared up for a feel-good finish will be sorely disappointed, reality rarely being the fairytale we would like it to be. Remaining true to the facts, the film's final lap delivers a double-whammy of a downer that drives home the fact that, sometimes, life just sucks.7.5 out of 10, rounded up to 8 for the hilarious scene in which Shelby takes Henry Ford II (Tracy Letts) for a quick spin (and I do mean quick!)."
"Really low effort, made-by-committee fare with no soul here, sorry.Absolutely hated Christian Bale's character and his family. Bale played a Brit loudmouth with a temper, his wife and kid played stereotypical posh Brits with a heart of gold and zero personality. They all came across as phony. Every character in this movie seemed like they were playing their modern day selves, just on a sixties set with sixties clothing.Matt Damon basically plays himself, almost like he walked off the Bourne set and put a cowboy hat on. Bam, that' was the extent of his attempt to play Carol Shelby. Total joke, I wouldn't have paid him a dollar to play this role. They really could have found someone better.The movie was an hour too long. It was dumbed down for the Thanksgiving Dinner crowd. If you didn't see the documentary, you wouldn't know what was going on. There really was nothing about the engineering that went on with making the car. It was all about Carroll Shelby and Ken Miles.Things about the movie were just weird. One character had a bubble jacket that I don't think would have been around back then. Matt Damon's character goes to meet Ken Miles' wife after a certain event, doesn't go speak to her...also, in spite of a tragic event recently happening, she and the kid act like nothing is wrong and life is great. It's really bizarre and lazy directing.I can't recommend the movie, it was terrible, sorry. The documentary is far superior. This was just bad."
"I've never taken Christian Bale for a great actor. His appeal is for people who enjoy some kind of technical perfection and fake authenticity over substance. His performance should keep rubes occupied, thinking they have witnessed something genuine, an example of what acting is supposed to be.Moving on to the story. Naturally, much of this didn't happen. The pitting of big corporatist Ford Motors against Miles the humble car racer was all made up and I guessed it while watching the film - they just put these cliches in knowing that millions of not so bright members of the public will never get tired how many thousands of times they have experienced these tropes. Anything to get people punching their fists in the air and rooting for their hero. Read the facts of the Miles story if you care at all.The only real recommendable parts of the film and the reason I bothered seeing it, were the racing scenes which are thrilling. The rest, acting, plot are still somewhere on the starting line."
"Matt Damon and Christian Bale both gave terrific performances, but I felt like the movie was lacking something throughout. In a movie about trying to build the world's fastest car they never show anyone actually build a car. It sets up a problem and then cuts immediately to the solution. I also feel like the ending is 20 minutes too long."
"James Mangold somehow turned what could potentially be a boring subject into one of the best films I have watched all year. Utilizing the strength of its cast and buoyed especially by a superb Christian Bale, this film was a true crowd pleaser.It was exciting from start to finish and the race sequences had my adrenaline pumping and had sweat rolling down my forehead. The sounds in this movie is superb and definitely adds to an immersive experience. This film, despite its run time, was never boring. Two hours and thirty minutes simply flew by watching this.A well directed film from start to finish. You have to see it in cinemas for the complete experience."
"This is not about Ford vs Ferrari. This is not about 24h Le Mans. This is about Shelby and Miles, dramatized Hollywood style."
"Who would've thought that the year's most purely enjoyable cinematic delight would come to us in the form of what on paper appears to be a petrol heads delight?Low and behold though, James Mangold's magnificently filmed, scripted and acted true life tale of motorsport legends Carroll Shelby and Ken Miles is not only a cracking biopic accessible to those of all ages but one of the year's best filmed big screen treats that is sure to be a major player at the upcoming awards season.Stepping behind the camera for the first time since he delivered big results with Logan in 2017, Mangold maintains the form he found with the well-respected comic book adaptation to give Ford v Ferrari (also known as Le Mans '66 in many territories) a consistent energy and heart that maintains an almost flawless ability across its two and a half hour run-time to keep us glued to the screen throughout.Mixing both character beats and high-octane spectacle, the race sequences in Ford v Ferrari are a site to behold, Mangold's managed to do what Ron Howard did with Rush a few years ago and make a car film for everyone as those seeking 4-wheeled action will be happy just as those that are seeking out character beats and focus will be.Working off a genuinely funny and heartfelt script by Jez and John-Henry Buttersworth and Jason Keller, Mangold's exploration of the typical American hero Shelby and the deadest driven and wild Ken Miles work with Ford in 1966 to create a machine that could take down Ferrari's reign as Le Mans champion may follow a formula we've come to expect from such a film but it does so in such a fun, energetic and soulful way that Ford v Ferrari feels fresh and new, with two killer central performances to boot.Teaming up for the first time in their varied career, Matt Damon as Shelby and Christian Bale as Miles create one of the year's most memorable double bills, an on screen relationship that will make you laugh, fist pump and possibly even shed a tear or two as the two motor racing geniuses battle against the odds, a bunch of Ford suit and ties and themselves to achieve their goals.We've come to expect a certain standard from these two performers but both Damon and Bale excel here, with Bale in particular delivering another awards worthy turn as Miles, who in the wrong hands could've become downright unlikeable but here comes out as a man we can't help but respect and admire. While its unlikely Bale will walk away with any significant silverware in such a crowded year for male performances of note, there's a good chance his turn here will be fondly remembered as one of his best.With these two fantastic lead turns front and centre throughout and a raft of memorable supporting performances from the likes of the always great Jon Bernthal, the slick Josh Lucas and a scene stealing Tracey Letts as Henry Ford 2, Ford v Ferrari is the all-round package, a trial against the odds underdog story that is a film everyone should check out, not just those already in the know about this wonderful true life tale.Final Say -A winning delivery of a tried and true formula makes Ford v Ferrari a ride worth taking, further enhanced by some immaculate direction and some wondrously entertaining performances, James Mangolds racing epic is one of the year's most memorable big screen events.4 ½ ruined bags of groceries out of 5"
"In spite of being a Motorsports fan I can truly say this was a great film. Brilliant casting of Matt Damon and Christian Bale and Ken Miles wife Mollie was spot on also. But it was the story that held you in suspense, especially during the racing scenes unexpected climax to the Me Mans race but still true to the real story. Dramatic ending when Ken died but again true to the story. Try to see this film even if you are not a Motorport fan"
"Just returned from the cinema. Another great performance from Bale and Damon. Great character development. The movie moves so fluently that it was felt much shorter than 2,5 hours. Instant Blu Ray purchase when it comes out. Another brilliant piece from the director that gave us Logan and Walk the Line."
"I don't recommend it. The drama was all about unconvincing excuses for depicting violence. Dramatic scenes and loud sounds does not in itself constitute good cinema. I had the thought that watching the move was like watching paint dry, but loudly.Techincally it was well done but there is no real story there, just famous names (both the actors and the characters depicted)."
"Ford v Ferrari is terrific. An old-fashioned movie but in a good way. A crowd pleaser. This is exactly the film movie studios don't make anymore. The race car scenes are authentic and exhilarating. The acting by Damon and Bale is spectacular and the friendship that grows between the two characters throughout the movie, going from competitors to friends, is enjoyable to watch. Movies like this are being released in theatres less and less so it's nice to see a drama aimed at adults in a movie theatre."
"This is the most entertaining and one of the most satisfying films I've seen in years. Don't let viewer reviews by racing snobs deter you from seeing it. Two and a half hours flew by. The script is tight and efficient with great pacing and just the right amount of drama, the racing scenes are thrilling and all the performances are excellent, with Christian Bale the standout. My husband and I have very different tastes in movies and this is one of the few that had enough action for him along with a captivating story for me; we were both riveted throughout. The whole film is as exciting and fun as the previews conveyed, which is rare in my experience."
2.5 hours and not a single second boring. Good actors and story. Very good directing by Mangold. Racing movies should be like this one because you think your the driver of the cars. This movie is made for theaters and not for TV. A must see.
"I must say .I'm not big fan of cars, especially sport cars . But I must say I feel the adrenaline in me when I was watching the movie on big screen. Christian Bale is just perfect,you can feel that very well ,just brilliant . I love the times also ,no internet,no smartphones,no plastic packing. The best taste of Coca-Cola is from glass bottle and printed label on it xxx"
"Great story and great acting, bit unsure about Christian bale's accent but that aside was good, although it was quite a long film it didnt drag, the dialogue was solid the action sequences great and you felt like you were there with them"
"Okay, where do I begin ? I personally think the movie is bad, I mean really bad. That was torture."
"Let me preface this by saying that I am quite a car guy. Not the type whose entire life revolves around cars, but I own a sports car and enjoy the odd track day. This means suspending my disbelief in a car movie is always a hard thing...... but this movie certainly doesn't make it easy! For a car-movie aimed at car people, it was strange to find it packed with inaccuracies and car cliches. The idea that a car explodes whenever it rolls or makes contact with a hard object had finally died in most of Hollywood's mainstream products. Why bring it back in a car-movie?Here are a few others:
-Ken's car seems to be so fast that he can catch up from with everybody whenever he decides to. Why isn't he winning in the first place?
-There's this cliche that racers can overtake each other in a straight line by deciding to press the throttle harder. Again, why aren't they already doing that?
-Brake fade and braking points obviously don't happen that way, and swapping out a knuckle assembly to cool the brakes is like buying a new phone because the home button is dead (oh wait...). Ford did come up with a quick brake-change solution (which almost every new car uses), but it looked nothing like this.
-the 7000rpm ramble present from the opening lines of the movie (and the movie's overall interpretation of RPM) is rather detached from reality. Different engine architectures behave differently at different RPMs, trying to pin that on a single value is strange and unneeded
-Sorry but car guys would never use ""her"" to refer to their automobile! It's not a ship!With that out of the way, on to the movie stuff:
-the writing team tries very hard to make the story overly dramatic, by utilizing lazy writing tricks (the Daytona bet, for example), which really shouldn't be necessary considering how fascinating the base story already is
-Christian Bale is a very good actor, but he really overdoes the Ken Miles character. There is close to no footage of the actual guy, so he had the opportunity to build whatever character and mimics he felt like. Why he chose to go so incredibly over the top (both in accentuation and behavior) is beyond me
-There's a lot of CG going on during the races. Quite a lot. It is not badly executed, but was it really necessary? There are historic races at Le Mans they could have taken footage from rather than leave us in the uncanny valleyIt's not all bad though. The story's a highly interesting one, and Matt Damon's performance is very good. His relationship with Ken Miles is touching, and having them compete against their own headquarters makes for a great double-sided challenge. And while the production's runtime is on the longer side of things, it never feels so.To sum things up, it is a more than decent movie (hence the 7/10 rating), and probably does a great job at translating what car racing feels like to people who aren't into it or know little about it (my wife had a really good time and enjoyed the movie's constant suspense, as well as its visuals and performances, so it's got to be doing something right!). However, it's neither Oscar-Winning, nor even remotely accurate when it comes to car stuff."
"I don't think this movie is gonna be groundbreaking or anything, but every single thing it does, it does it extremely well. From the acting, to the story, to the directing, etc. Everything in this movie is awesome. It feels much shorter than its runtime, it's exciting and also very emotional when it needs to be. I loved every second of it. Oh and the sound was amazing in the theater I went to, definitely watch it in theaters, maybe IMAX if you get the chance!"
"Director James Mangold known for many movies including Girl, Interrupted, Walk the Line, 3:10 to Yuma has directed the movie Ford v Ferrari based on American car designer Carroll Shelby ( excellent acting by Matt Damon) and driver Ken Miles (Christian Bale known for American psycho, The Fighter, Vice, the Big Short). Shelby knows Ken is an excellent driver and can easily compete and win a race. Ken is married to Mollie( actress Caitrona Balfe) and the couple have an adorable son Peter( Noah Jupe ..seen him in A Quiet place). Peter follows his dad to the races and autobody shop. Ken is a simple man. Tracy Letts as Henry Ford II has to decide if Ken can enter car race in Le Mans, France and represent Ford. Josh Lucas plays role of Leo Beebe , right hand man for Henry Ford II and does not like Ken's appearance and mannerisms. I particularly liked the scene when Shelby has to tell Ken that because of his image ,Ken cannot be Ford's race car driver. Matt Damon was terrific as Shelby who has money and power to make decisions in favor of Ken but has to get over hurdles created by Leo. I really enjoyed the scenes when Shelby talks to Ford about how folders had to change hands so many times before reaching Ford and impact of decision making involving too many people. Christian Bale as Ken Miles exudes enthusiasm and passion for race cars and abilities to handle speed. Miles is happy to run the race and not too concerned about winning. Jon Bernthal ( movies The wolf of wall street, The Accountant) did very well as Lee Iacocca who agrees with Shelby's faith in Ken's race car driving abilities. Good ensemble of talented actors. Oscar worthy acting by Matt Damon . 2 hrs 32 minutes of Cars, mechanics of fast cars and differences between Ford and Ferrari manufacturers was truly interesting and very well presented. Excellent Direction."
"Storyline, acting of each characters is totally amazing."
Highly recommend watching this movie. Such a great story to be told.
"This is as simple as a kids Movie and the stereotype characters and simple-minded dialogues made me laugh. Womens (beside Ms. Miles) are completely missing. A lot of scenes are ungainly constructet (wheel nut, stopwatch, ...) or just boring. And why the hell Mr. Miles carries everywhere in the world everytime the same coffee pot? And beside all this to me the race scenes weren't really thrilling."
"Had a personal day yesterday and picked out a movie I figured my girlfriend didn't want to see (and boy was I right, for multiple reasons).Bale phones in his performance with a subpar Cockney accent that doesn't fool ANYONE, the script is predictable and the dialogue is flat and boring and makes you cringe so many times you start fearing for your health.I was close to leaving the theater at multiple occasions, and I was never as close as during the ""fight"" scene outside Bale's house. At that point, one thinks someone in the crew should've had the integrity to raise his or her voice and say they should just go ahead and scrap the whole thing. Cut their losses.It felt like a two hour and thirty minute Disney Channel-straight-to-DVD movie that could've easily been compressed to 60 minutes.The only demographics I see enjoying this are kids, and male car buffs in their 60s that still daydream about winning ""that"" race and riding down into the sunset with that girl from high school they were too scared to speak to speak to 45 years ago.For Bale, whose been on a roll in decent years, this movie is blemish of the worst kind. Sucks."
Matt Damon slayed it. Enjoyed Christian Bale. Caitriona Balfe is a one dimensional Actor doesn't really add to Movie other than they needed a woman character for the Movie. She needs more acting classes or something
"Christian Bale and Matt Damon together in one IMAX frame is just mind boggling ! And it is sensationally directed by James Mangold !!
James carefully articulated each frame to make the audience feel a real-time experience of a passionate driver and passionate race car designer while reliving the rivalry between FORD & FERRARI."
"So many epic scene.
Both Matt Damon and Christian Bale are brilliant actors.10 out of 10 indeed."
"Le Mans '66I saw this at the Cineworld secret screening and my heart sank having already condemned it from the trailer. I loath movies about racing cars and I hate Christian Bale with a vengeance. Well despite these ""minor"" prejudices this was a really great movie.Centering on a biopic of Ken Miles life as a racing car driving, played by Bale, and his friend Carroll Shelby, played by Damon. These two central roles were delivered with passion and some very fine acting. I could be wrong but Christian Bale's diction was so much better in his native english rather than the mumbling guttural we are usually straining to unjumble.The elongated driving sequences were exhausting and to long for me but I could see others around me lapping this up. The entire ensemble were brilliant and really created the atmosphere of the racetrack and the maverick sportsmen of the 60's.With regard to awards my mind tells me that there are merely supporting actor nominations here because neither of the leads here displayed any comprehensive array of emotions and that discounts them. Ditto for best movie."
"I saw this at a mystery screening at my local cinema. When I saw the title card, I was dismayed. First because I have no knowledge of, nor interest in, motor racing. Second, because from the start I was expected to root for Ford, when in all sporting events involving an American team and a non-American team, I always root for the latter as a point of principle.
I'm glad I stuck it out, as the film had me sold almost from the start. How true or accurate it is, I neither know nor care, as I was totally involved in the story. Yes there are cliched elements (the interfering company executives etc), and there were rather more dramatic gear-changes than we really needed - but the film revolves around two terrific performances from Matt Damon and, particularly, Christian Bale as a man who not only lives and breathes motor-oil, but regularly showers in the stuff as well.
Petrolheads will love it. Non-petrolheads will love it as well."
"Brilliant performance by Christian Bale as Ken Miles. I'm not sure ANYONE could play Carroll Shelby but Carroll Shelby, but if you didn't KNOW Carroll Shelby, Matt Damon also turns in a wonderful performance. But the RACING...and the whole ""world"" of racing...is just so satisfying and exciting. If you can see it in IMAX or ScreenX that will definitely enhance the experience.There is a also a new documentary called, ""Shelby American"" that goes into much more detail about the racing events documented in ""Ford v Ferrari"" that I would highly recommend you watch before going if you aren't already familiar with the Shelby/Ford/Ferrari drama that played out in the 1960's.My husband saw Ford v Ferrari and at first was nit-picking the details. He's a hard-core Ford nut and knows the real story upside down and backwards. So we went to see it again together and THIS time he just relaxed and enjoyed it instead of comparing it to what really happened.Caution...when you walk out of the theater you will feel like driving really, really fast.This movie deserve a bunch of Oscars. Christian Bale especially but Best Picture would not be out of the question."
"I saw the good reviews for this one got curious finally checked it this is a great movie!! (And I'm not even a car guy) good story, pretty good characters you feel the race sequences!! Did take me a little while to know the characters at first and some scenes can drag but overall great surprise of a film for me worth watching in the theater ( watch in row 3 or 4 so closer for the racing scenes) it's a must see if you're car person and if not still recommend it you might like it like I did;)"
"An absolutely terrific film. It's been a long time since a movie had such a brilliant cast-literally, every single performance is spectacular. Matt Damon, Christian Bale, Caitriona Balfe, Noah Jupe, Jon Bernthal, Josh Lucas, McMullen, Letts, McKinnon, and Girone all play their roles to balanced perfection. James Mangold's direction is spectacular, the film's cinematography is jaw-droppingly brilliant, the editing is masterful, and the score of Marco Beltrami and Buck Sanders is excellent. Brilliant acting, direction, cinematography, score, and editing; pulse-pounding, jaw-dropping, and thrilling; laugh-out-loud humorous yet incredibly emotional-this is literally everything you could want out of a film. Excellent."
"Great movie from an another age...
... an era, when there was no computer assisted driving aids (ABS, ASR, etc).
When there was no climate change hysteria, no pc-culture.
When man's was masculine, women's was feminine, and nobody mixed up things.
Mat Damon and Christian Belle are gorgeous.Ps.:
In the movie Ken Miles wife, Mollie (Caitriona Balfe) was a big, heart warming surprise for me.
She loved her husband till the very end, and support him in good and bad times well.
It is very hard to find a woman like her, these days...
She still loved and support her husband, when he told her that they lost everything, and they are broke as can be...
The IRS closed down the garage, etc...The '60s...
Another times, another world, another moral."
"James Mangold has really proved himself as a reliable, versatile and extraordinary director over the years. He has made many remarkable films and appears to keep improving with age. Ford v Ferrari is no exception and I think it is about time Mangold take home some awards at the next Oscars, although there is definitely a good likelihood both Bale and Damon will get plenty of attention for their stellar performances. This film is absolutely fantastic and for a film that is 2.5 hours it definitely didn't feel long thanks mainly to the superb direction, cinematography and sound which are all pronounced in every racing or driving scene. I am very excited to see Mangold's future work and would highly recommended Ford v Ferrari."
"The movie was done really, really good. I enjoyed it very much and i have no cons to disclose. The movie was simply fantastic, and you'll learn a few critical things as well about the history of Ford & Ferrari. Two thumbs up."
"A beautiful story/rivalry very well told. Christian Bale at his best, indeed a Oscar worthy performance. Sets, cars takes you back to late 60s, you get fully immersed into it. Racing sequences are also very well shot, enjoyed it thoroughly. Apart from racing legends Ken Miles and Carrol Shelby, you'll get to see automotive legends Lee Iacocca, Henry Ford II and Enzo Ferrari. One need not be a car race lover to watch this wonderful movie. Go for it, you'll love it for sure."
"Amazing performance by the lead actors - Matt Damon and Christian Bale, their chemistry is palpable. Christian Bale delivers another moving performance in this movie. The workings of a big ugly corporation like Ford was captured very well in this movie. I loved the small details such as Enzo Ferrari tipping his hat to Ken Miles while Ford and everyone else is congratulating the winner. Shows that Mr. Ferrari is the true lover of the sport and a thorough gentleman."
Petrol heads will probably enjoy this and the racing scenes are well done but there was nothing that really gripped me about this movie. The two central characters were pretty good but the film could use at least 20 minutes of trimming. Not bad abut also not great
"James Mangold is a highly acclaimed filmmaker, who have made the Copland with Stallone, the very good Walk the Line, featuring Johnny Cash, who played Joaquin Phoenix himself, and the Logan, an extremely good movie, what gave depth to a superhero character , whose name is Wolverine, all in a way that been taken very seriously and we could feel Logan's drama and fulfillment. As you can see from our director's filmography, he has done quite a variety of film projects and has not done two films on the same subject, until now, since he has made again a biographical film, just like Walk the Line, to our luck.The story centers on two passionate and unwavering figures, Ken Miles and Carroll Shelby, who are avid racing enthusiasts and experts. Carroll was a Formula One pilot, who has become a car designer, and as a rider and a car designer, he has great success. Carroll's friend, Ken, a wildly talented pilot is trying to make a living from repairing cars, but not very successful. In addition to buffering cars, he enjoys his passion for racing in his spare time. His wife is very supportive with her husband and they are trying to solve their financial problems together. Their little son, Peter often goes to his father's races, which his father wins all the time. Carroll supports his friend's competitions, because he knows, that he's a huge talent, but he can't control his temper, what making him a difficult man to handle. Because of this fervor, he cannot break out, even though he is an ancient talent. One day, however, the Ford looking for Carroll to build a vehicle in a relatively short period of time, that will be able to push down the big rival Ferrari. He hesitantly asks Ford management to hire Kent as a pilot for Ford.In the lead roles, we can see famous actors like Christian Bale, who plays the hotspot Kent, and besides him is Matt Damon, who plays Carroll the ex-racer and professional car designer. The cast of the two protagonists have done well, their roles are very good and the chemistry is working very much between them. Christian Bale had to lose 20 pounds, after being cast in the Vice, while in the aforementioned movie he had to lose nearly as much weight, but this is not new from Christian Bale, the master of physical transformation. The whole cast is well-selected, however, the two main actors take over the rest actors, and these actors are not even close to the main performances. Mangold's work is full of passion, emotion, for example, the moment, when Ken listens to the radio and he lists the mistakes, what they made during the race, even though he doesn't even see the event. Ken's relationship with his son has also been very emotional, as the father, who is not the best at expressing love, is trying to establish a kind of bond with his child through his passion. Carroll's character could not be presented in such depth, but nevertheless it did not become a superficial character, only he hasn't got as many layers as Ken, played by Christian Bale. We also need to mention the photography, which is wonderful. Some of the film's races are simulated by real-life stuntmens, and some are solved with CGI, but needless to say, the real and CGI footage are almost indistinguishable, because if the good camera settings and cuts. There is nothing brilliant about the script, the dialogues are character-based, so this part of the piece is totally good.The Ford v Ferrari has become an exceptionally good workmanship carried by the giant actors and by the masterfully composed sequences. I recommend this movie to everyone. To get the full effect, don't read the story, if you don't know it, because it made it even more enjoyable for me, so my rating is: 7/10"
Saw this as part of a preview screening event. The dynamic between the 2 main characters (Matt Damon as Carroll Shelby & Christian Bale as Ken Miles) is electric and really emmersed me into the story. In America this film has been titled Ford vs Ferrari though personally I didn't think Ford came out well from this biopic. Nevertheless one of the best films of the year so far!!
"It's not easy to make car racing look interesting on film, as shots of cars going around corners and faceless drivers shifting gears start to feel pretty repetitive. Though the many scenes of fast driving do add some adrenaline, the film has to rely on a dramatic arc that hinges on the possibility of building a fast car and getting the right driver. Unfortunately this dilemma advances all too predictably, and features static characters in cookie-cutter relationships that feature no real tension and no development whatsoever. The characters are drawn well enough to elicit a few laughs at unexpected juxtapositions, but mostly they just go through the motions, and we literally hear the same overblown lines at the end of the film as we do at the beginning, as though the film wanted to remind viewers that nothing actually happens in between. Some nice period touches and decent turns by some supporting actors working with limited material demonstrate that the filmmakers were at least trying, but the flat relationships and tepid dialog keep things moving at a snooze. Maybe watch it on an airplane if there's nothing better?"
"This long movie is quite involving and the races are exciting. The in the driver's seat point of view makes the races exciting and the David v Goliath thing always gets you rooting for the underdog. Enjoyable even for non race car enthusiasts. The actors are good from main to supporting. Bale is convincing as the driver. Damon looks suitably tired and puffy as the ex driver turned designer.Some faults - Some scenes could have been cut. The wife's hissy fit could have been cut. Josh Lucas' mini nasty character was over done for the sake of having a villain, Jez Butterworth the screen writer wrote plays that have made it to Broadway and are excruciatingly and unnecessarily long. Don't understand some of the strong accents of Christian Bale and his wife. The movie should have ended right after Le Mans. Less of a downer if they had."
"Good ride! That's the best summary. Ford v Ferrari is a good drama about the Ford company wanting to out-top Ferrari in the race tracks. It tells the story of Chelby and Miles and their crusade to win the Le Mans 24 hours race.Damon and Bale are top-notch here. Great acting, great scenes. Might make you even cry.Soundtrack is good and keeps the tone of the movie.Movie kinda drags for a while sometimes... it could be a little shorter. Sometimes it's just some drama filler to build up for what we are waiting for: the Le Mans race.Nothing to say on the events credibility because I'm not familiar with the real facts, and that doesn't bother me as well. It's supposed to be someone's take on the story, and that's ok by me!Overall, I'd recommend it if you like racing and drama combined."
"Directors can kill a good script, or the movie can be spectacularly well done like this one.I kept marveling at the wonderful sets that made the movie feel like it was the 1960's.There was well placed humor throughout.The CGI was also quite well done.It's been a long time since I've watched a movie as well done as this one."
"Eventhough it might look like another generic racing movie, Ford v Ferrari is actually a very engaging and emotional story about two people who work against the various obstacles they face in order to achieve their aim. The performances by Christian bale and Matt Damon were top notch and both their characters are throughly fleshed out. The storyline involving Miles's family was also executed very well and helped in further developing his character. The hard work done by Miles, Shelby and their team, in order to win the race at Le Mans as well as the constant interferences from the executives, form the central narrative of the movie. The movie portrays the contrasting perspectives of both these sides quite well. The racing sequences were directed magnificently by Mangold and keeps you at the edge of your seats. It was done primarily using practical effects and very little CGI and its impact is clearly feltThere are a few cliches that we usually see in biopics like this, especially the villain. There are also a few parts where we might find it predictable. But other than that, it's an engaging and excellently crafted movie that keeps you engrossed from the beginning, with well developed characters and a lot of heart"
"Cast, acting, story are really good, before watching I thought it may be boring, but no. It was interesting every minute. Nothing too crazy, but sad in the end 😞"
"Greetings again from the darkness. 7000 RPM. Racing legend Carroll Shelby describes that as the moment of racing bliss in the opening of the film. We are reminded of early test pilots breaking the sound barrier, or explorers reaching the peak of Mt. Everest. What follows is two-and-a-half hours of history, rivalries, egos, and sport. The racing scenes are exhilarating, and the men are driven by testosterone and compelled to be the best. They are throwbacks to a different era. An era that wasn't about fairness and feelings, but of determination and focus that produced results - either success or failure. There were winners and losers, and the ceremonies awarded no participation ribbons.Who are these men? They are Carroll Shelby, Ken Miles, Henry Ford II, and Enzo Ferrari. Director James Mangold (LOGAN, WALK THE LINE) takes the 1966 24 Hours of Le Mans and turns it into a rivalry between car makers, a friendship between racing icons, a look at corporate buffoonery that still exists today, and an old-fashioned movie that is fun to watch ... regardless of whether you know the first thing about racing or cars.Matt Damon plays Carroll Shelby, the war veteran race driver-turned-designer hired to push Ford racing into world class status. Shelby is an industry icon who won the 1959 Le Mans before retiring due to a heart condition. He then founded and ran Shelby-American for designing and improving cars. He wore cowboy hats that were only eclipsed in size by his bravura in most situations. Christian Bale plays legendary driver Ken Miles, another war veteran and bombastic friend of Shelby, who can best be described as a race car savant. Contrary to the film's title, the story belongs to these two men, and the film belongs to these two actors.Co-writers Jez Butterworth, John-Henry Butterworth, and Jason Keller take some liberties with the script and bend a few historical details to make the parts fit a Hollywood production ... but for the most part, the story is pretty accurate. Just a few years after the Edsel fiasco, Henry Ford II is agitated at the state of Ford Motor Company, and after a bitter and personally insulting failed buyout of Ferrari, Mr. Ford (played with proper arrogance by Tracy Letts) decides to engage in motor-measuring with the Italian company run by Enzo Ferrari (Remo Girone). He hires Shelby to elevate Ford racing to elite status with one main goal - beating Ferrari at Le Mans. Shelby's cocksure approach manages to keep Miles onboard despite the internal battles with Ford executives, especially Leo Beebe (a smarmy Josh Lucas). Beebe doesn't see Miles as ""a Ford man"", and in what is all too common in corporate life, prefers style over substance.The film could have easily been titled Corporate vs Cars. Although the Henry Ford vs Enzo Ferrari segment is quite entertaining, most of the time is spent with Shelby and Miles trying to reach their dream while negotiating corporate obstacles. These two men have a love for racing and each other - in an old school, manly-respect kind of way. They are simpatico in their quest for the perfect car, and as Miles explains to his son (Noah Jupe) in a terrific scene, the perfect lap.Additional supporting roles include Jon Bernthal as young visionary Lee Iacocca (who died earlier this year), Caitriona Balfe as Miles' supportive wife, and Ray McKinnon as Phil Remington, the lead engineer on Shelby's team. Of course, Iacocca went on to become Chairman of Chrysler, where he brought in Shelby to consult on the Dodge Viper, among other models. Supposedly Le Mans racing legend and 6-time winner Jackie Ickx appears in a crowd shot, but I missed it.There is a stark contrast between the Ferrari factory and the Ford assembly line, but the egos at the top are remarkably similar. A bruised ego lit the fuse for the rivalry, but it was the car guys who made it happen. The racing scenes are adrenaline-packed and the sound in the theatre, combined with Cinematographer Phedon Papamichael (SIDEWAYS, NEBRASKA) close-ups inside the car, allow us to feel the rumble and vibration and speed sensation inside the Ford GT40. Damon and Bale are terrific. Damon struts with Shelby's confidence, and Bale (after a huge weight loss from his role as Dick Cheney in VICE) captures the cantankerous genius of Miles - plus seeing his yell at other drivers during races is hilarious. There is a comical rumble between Miles and Shelby that will remind no one of Batman and Jason Bourne, but as difficult as it is to make popping a clutch exciting on the big screen, Mangold's team comes through."
"From the director of ""Logan"", ""Walk the Line"" and ""Identity"" comes a true story about Ford's attempt to take Ferrari from the throne of Le Mans.
This film is an embodiment of a careless and fun experience. Because of the perfect pacing, the film manages to keep you engaged and entertained for 2 and a half hours.
This film could be separated into two sections. The first one is a preparation for the minor races and the big finale. The second section would be racing itself. The first two acts are about the relationship between Damon's and Bale's characters. Although, it's not anything new or spectacular, their relationship was very well executed and you could've believed that they were good friends. They didn't show that at all times, but you could feel it because of the tight script which elevated both of their characters. Besides their relationship, the film focuses a lot on a behind the scene conflicts in a Ford company. Yet again, because of the script that ended up being very interesting. The rest of the film focuses on a racing, and I was actually surprised by how much runtime racing took. The grand finale takes almost a whole third act, and because of the way it was filmed, you don't even notice that. When the film gives you the opportunity to immerse yourself into a racing contest, it doesn't let go of you. That brings us to the best part of the film, and that was the way it was filmed, and also the whole production design. It's impressive that they managed to almost completely avoid the usage of CGI. Instead, they shoot the racing sequences in the cars whilst driving. When you're shooting that in a practical way, it's easier to get the audience invested. You notice appealing camera angles, immersive sound design, production design and all the details that went into designing this film. One of the reasons why did they choose that approach is James Mangold, who is the creator of that idea. He had a vision and he accomplished to achieve it. He's slowly becoming one of the most versatile directors working today. He touched almost every genre there is, and yet, he did not make a terrible film so far. Besides his visual decisions, he managed to pull out incredible performances from the whole cast. Matt Damon and Christian Bale were incredible. Damon in a bit subtle role and Bale in a showier role, both of them delivered. It's a shame that both of them are being campaigned for a leading category at the Oscars, so they are probably going to cancel each other's votes, but nonetheless, they were at the top of their game. Besides them, I would like to compliment Jon Bernthal, who in his short time on the screen put a damn good performance.This film is definitely one of the better technical achievements of this year. If you're interested in seeing this film, check it out whilst it's still in cinemas. Watching it in cinemas certainly elevates the experience, and it emphasizes the huge amount of attention to details."
"Here's my review of Ford v Ferrari . So F v F is the true story of how Ford established a name in racing over a feud with Ferrari while also being a Ken Miles biopic , and James Mangold does both like a master and knocks it out of the park. Christian bale got down to his og English accent and absolutely kills it as Ken Miles with his method acting , Matt Damon too was really good as Carrol Shelby and so were the rest of the cast . The story is an underdog tale about Ford , a company which makes cars for the common man , teaming up with former racer Shelby and his Man behind the wheel , Ken Miles. None of their pasts are revealed or even hinted at and yet you care for these characters , the movie makes you realise that by throwing in a will he die / won't he die based on reaching the rpm limit throughout the entire second act . Also , this movie is masterfully shot by Phedon Papamichael known for walk the line and Ides of March and he makes every frame look gorgeous , which is aided by sleek editing , music and sound design. In the end , Ford v Ferrari is a well directed , masterfully shot , brilliantly acted biopic with neat dialogue , powerful characters , passion towards a goal , a rush of adrenaline , one chameleon called Christian Bale and Ford's marketing strategy ironically said through tons and tons of coca cola product placement."
"The director of the film James Mangold himself claims in interviews that he shot 'Saving Private Ryan' in the reverse, a film that unfolds gradually, and in the third act shows all its beauty, in a monumental scene portraying the course of the great and one of the toughest car races in the world - Le Mans, during which racers drove all day and night.At first, however, I would like to briefly address the loud and polarizing opinions about this film that have already appeared.
So the ultra-left side (swjs) already thinks that this movie is a step backwards, because it focuses on the friendship of two white men and generally it is a movie packed with alpha men fighting for power. Of course, this is unfair simplification and not true.This film tells a classic story of David vs Goliath, a story of beautiful friendship between two passionate people. On the surface this is a film about a duel between Ford and Ferrari in Le Mans, but if we dive deeper, it is truly a story about eternal struggle between corporation and artists (which can also be transferred to the film industry itself).Therefore, people should forget about politics at least once, especially if we are in the world of art, cinema, film, because pushing politics into everything becomes really devastating and toxic, art / films are given contexts that simply do not exist in these specific cases. Ford and Ferrari is a nostalgic return to the old cinema, yes, it talks mainly about men, but also about their passion, family and love. About small- big things that are simple and present in everyone's life, it is a film for everyone.Other opinions that I heard are that the whole story is too simple and predictable, and the characters are not shown enough off the race track, too little character study. First of all, the allegation about the simplicity of this story is absurd, because the director clearly wanted to make such a film - it's not just a car film, but a classic western as the director himself confirmed in an interview for The Times : ''As much as I felt like I was making a race movie, I was making Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, a movie about friendship "" - he said. And it's true.This film ticks off every known point in the classic western story, in which you can find a duel between the good and the bad, fight between the charming 'outlaw' poets of the wheel and the great, bad, big bosses of something much bigger. Perhaps, as some say, Mangold's mistake was focusing too much on the conflict of bureaucracy - the racetrack, but as I read in interviews, the script was re-written several times, it was supposed to be an old classic cinema about male friendship and hardships and it works. And yes - from time to time, we need to take a break from the over-intellectualised and psychologically intense cinema and we simply need such pure entertainment, with a dose of pathos, emotions, great collective scenes and two very pleasant acting performances.And now back to these two main characters. Bale and Damon play two geniuses, one of whom can communicate with the rest of the world like a normal human and belong to a larger community (Damon's Shelby) and the other (Bale's Miles), is a total freak, an outsider incompatible with anyone and anything except maybe his wife and son, exuberant eccentric. But it is exactly this '' separateness '', internal life, loneliness and quirks of Miles, that can lead to the defeat of the invincible Ferrari. These two make the film from beginning to end and the chemistry between them is great. The duo dynamics provide us with a few really hilarious scenes, one of which deserves special attention - the fight scene near Miles's home. Bale and Damon are excellent comedy-wise in this scene, as middle-aged daddies pathetically trying to knock each other down with bread or a trash can lid.For me, these two performances deserve recognition, because Damon and Bale did what they could with the script they got. They both did a lot of work.However, if I had to choose one, I would choose Bale. Bale plays Ken Miles, the maverick British racing driver really brilliantly. His energy, the entire digging into the psychology of the character, but also into his physicality - Christian is a master of total acting. Pay attention to the work of his arms at the cinema - just like Miles, and yet there are so few video clips with Miles. Bale's acting is not at all 'too big', Miles is just like that in this movie - explosive, impulsive, full of passion, but also has a tart language without a filter for those who want to manipulate him. Also, let's not forget that Bale spoke personally to Miles's son Peter, as he prepared for the role.Miles was a bona-fide eccentric, and his cockpit monologues have something of Top Gear about them.""Learn to drive, you pillock!"" he roars as someone cuts him up. ""More of that please, giddy up!"" he shouts when the car responds. ""This feels like a bag of squirrels!"" he yells when it doesn't. Miles was from Birmingham, but Bale's version has more than a touch of Yorkshire. He is basically an unholy hybrid of Jeremy Clarkson, Alan Partridge and Geoffrey Boycott.""Christian had this remarkable list of Brummie expressions he made on a wadded-up piece of notepaper"" Mangold said in The Times interview ""I'd like to frame it. People said that Miles liked to talk to himself while he was driving and we hadn't really written any ongoing mutterings for him. So between takes when he was in the car, Christian had this piece of paper: 'Your face is redder than a spiked arse . . . let's not go round the Wrekin (Black Country slang for going the long way).' "" I find this anecdote hilarious.According to the director, double-decker rigs allowed Bale and co to be filmed in the cars while they were driven by professional drivers sitting on the roof. ""So the actors are moving through space at 100 miles an hour, they're amid other traffic all being driven by pros, but they're allowed to act, remember their lines, take notes."" Or, in Bale's case, swear like a trooper.Bale's character is certainly, heightened (but as I wrote this is Miles in this story) hurling wrenches as freely as he chucks insults. Mangold thinks the performance expresses ""a lot of the joy in Christian's soul. So many of his roles, in a very direct contradiction of who he is in life, are just very grim. The playfulness rarely gets a chance to shine.""With Phoenix, as with Bale and Daniel Day Lewis, ""you're not even sure where the acting stops"", Mangold said. ""There's a kind of danger.'' and he added : ''Matt, Christian, Joaquin, Russell Crowe, Vanessa Redgrave, Robert De Niro: they come to the set to play. They're the opposite of tricky - they want to be directed and they've worked with many great directors, so they have a great deal of trust.''And for all these reasons, for me Christian Bale is actually the most fascinating actor in today's film world. He is the most unique and unpredictable actor of modern actors. He always turns left when everyone else turns right, and vice versa - goes straight when the others turn. His choices are quite unusual, they never go with fashion, with mainstream.In the previous year, he played without hesitation in the very polarizing '' Vice '' and there is no doubt that he angered many on the right side of the political scene, and today he plays in an old-fashioned western - sport film about purely male friendship, which, as I can see, has already annoyed some feminists and ultra-leftists.But Christian only goes his own ways, just like Ken Miles, and chooses roles that challenge him, not because of political correctness. As he has shown more than once, he does not care who he can anger with his dark, witty, sardonic and self-deprecating sense of humor (you can see it in many interviews) and I absolutely love it.Finally, that's why Christian is a brilliant actor, one of a kind, but also a chameleon - because I've read thousands of comments online about him and no one actually has a clue. But James Mangold, who is friends with Bale, gave a great IndieWire interview about the film and Bale, one great quote: '' I felt the role was close to Bale and prayed he would do it. He's a model to me of artistic perseverance and flexibility. He'll text you with thoughts and free associations about the character. It's all incredible food. He's a wonderful father, loving husband, great friend. He's not interested in being famous. He drives a pickup truck, he's grounded in the world, he raced motorcycles but had to stop when he got hurt, when he had kids. There are so many parts of Ken in Christian, who's a perfectionist. He's trying to achieve something for himself. It's magical to direct someone like that because they draw you into their own idealism. You feel that energy; it permeates the set''.Like Once Upon a Time . . . in Hollywood, Le Mans '66 is about ""the transition moment for men in the Sixties as the world is changing from underneath them"", Mangold says. With their nonchalant machismo and hands-on practicality, Miles and Shelby are an endangered species, as Leonardo DiCaprio's and Brad Pitt's characters were in Quentin Tarantino's movie. Mangold seems a bit like that too. Not a dinosaur, but one of those muscular all-rounders who would have thrived in the golden age of Tinseltown.He smiles. ""I'd be very happy 50 years ago, in the Hollywood system."" He says he's trapped, but he has always been ""a wanderer in terms of genre"", from cops to cowboys, asylum inmates to country singers, superhero pensioners to retro racers. He thinks his versatility has been ""almost to his detriment"". Nonsense. Mangold is just that quaint, old-fashioned thing: a really good director.Let this be the ultimate encouragement. Ford vs Ferrari is an epic, old-fashioned cinema, no CGI, they had car replicas, for that reason only it's worth watching in the cinema, on a big screen."
"One word: boring. Whoever thought this was a good idea for a movie should learn programming computers to perform specific functions. They should certainly never work at anything requiring interaction with the public. No good guys, bad guys, twists, or payoffs on the supposed expectations. I don't viscerally hate many movies. This is one. I usually like Damon, Bale, Berndahl, and many of the other cast. I had to force myself to sit through the whole thing. If you really want to check this out, wait for free streaming somewhere. This is clearly one of those movies that critics are pushing to demonstrate their ""influence"" or get paid, and there are so many fake 9/10 and 10/10 reviews here it's hard to trust IMBD anymore."
"I wont dinied ford v ferrari has quality in it which is hard not to have when mangold is director and damon and bale stars and it will be great watch for some,but to me it wasnt,i was never fan of cars and racing so i coudnt invest myself in story and at some points it became for me boring and to long,ford v ferrari will probably win some awards and for that i say it deserves,but at the end i myself would rather watch something else"
Incredible well made. Beautifully shot and and surprisingly emotional. Loved every second of it. Hope it does well in the awards season.
"I had zero interest in this movie. It didn't look bad but it didn't seem too interesting to me. Main reason I had little interest was because it was directed by James Mangold(I've never been disappointed in his movies, especially with logan) and this was amazing. Great acting and chemistry between the two leads. Bale and Damon were amazing together. Had a very interesting story as well. Great racing scenes throughout. At 152 minutes the movie was never slow or boring, and always pulling the viewer in. Didn't feel long at all. Very sad ending. Makes me want to know more about this event. Mangold's best film , besides Logan. Really great film. Hope it gets some oscar noms."
"For what it was, well done, but didn't have much drama, excitement, or emotion and there is two and a half hours of it.I'm well versed in the story having and viewed material about it many times over the years.Was worth a watch but can't recommend it for your average viewer. There's just not enough there for your average viewer. If your a car person, specifically car history it's possibly more your speed.I've fallowed Ferrari and the GT40 as far as Ford is concerned; but I'll probably never watch this one again.Good n then for getting it make but there's not much here for most people."
"Just finished it, they absolutely killed it! Christian Bale and Matt Damon deserve awards for their performances."
"Ford v Ferrari just adds to the growing list of amazing films to come out in 2019, it delivers one of the most entertaining films I've ever seen, the film is 2 hours and 30 minutes long, but it doesn't feel like that at all because of how exciting and engaging the film is. James Mangold has proved that he is a seriously underrated director and needs to be considered as one of the best working today. The cast is fantastic especially Christian Bale who should be in Oscar talks this year. He delivered what I believed was the best performance last year in Vice and he once again gives such an amazing performance alongside Matt Damon who is also awesome in the film.The film also explores dynamics such as: A father son relationship and being proud of who you are as a person which were really poignant. The sound mixing and editing is Oscar worthy with the cars sounding so awesome. It also explores all the aspects to racing that are rarely explored in film such as: The strategy behind winning the race, finding the right driver for the car, the business behind the racing and all the politics that are associated with it.The only nitpicky thing I could find is that some audiences may find the beginning to be a little slow and would like 5-10 mins cut out from the film so that it is a tighter package however it didn't really bother me at all.Overall Ford v Ferrari treats its subject matter with care, the film has great direction, fantastic acting and explores such interesting themes that I think it transcends the genre so people who aren't even fans of cars and racing will still love this film."
"Ye Gods, what a dreadful film. What is that Christian Bale character supposed to be? That cockney accent (I think?)... Dick van Dyke springs to mind. And his 'missus' - coom in fora cuppa. But that doesn't go near explaining how dreadful it all is - the two cars racing side by side, for miles(!) with the drivers staring across at each other. Yeah. At two hundred miles an hour. And how many cliches do you want? Ferrari are Italian? Lets make all their team and mechanics, like.. excitable. Peter Sellers could have got the gig. And Ken is on the bus on the way to Le Mans.. it's France! Let's sit two nuns behind him. He gets off the bus. We'll have two gendarmes walking past. Christ, send for Sellers! Get him out that Ferrari gear. He now should speak like zees! I nearly walked out. Y"
"I sat down front with the surround hi-tech sound vibrating my whole body as the revs passed 7000 causing my adrenaline to kick me into high gear. And the movie was good too: acting supreme, the car fast beyond imagination, and the people just as real, keeping me riveted to the screen 'til the very end. I don't doubt that was exactly how it played out.The only downside was that every time I instinctively reached for the gear shift, it was on the other side. But I'll get it right after a few more laps!"
"Wow when I heard 2.5 hours, i calculating how many times I could go to the washroom just to take a break. Not once did I get up..not for a minute.
The story, the visuals, the acting..oh Mr. Bale you have to get nominated again and throw one in for Mr. Damon too because their onscreen chemistry was electrifying and super fun. Coming from a female who has no interest in racing cars, this was a joyride in itself, watching the cars go around the track, the speed, the adrenal and Mr. Bale's facial expressions while driving was truly a delight to witness. Thanks for the great ride guys. Loved every moment."
"This is a great movie. Casting, visuals, script and actual story! Definitely did the car movies justice and should go down as one of the all time best. Don't wanna give anything away but damn, FvF is outstanding!!"
Few will understand the dynamics and commitments necessary to be in the league that this movie portrays. Enjoy the ride and learn about what it takes to perform at the level of winners!
"The plot is given straight away with Henry Ford II insulted by Ferrari and vowing to win the Le Mans race by building a race car. But what makes this movie amazing is the narrative and performances from Matt Damon and Christian Bale that makes you feel you are in the driver seat. The scenes where the culture at Ford affects the innovation and Shellby's pitch to put Ken Miles behind the wheels are wonderful and makes the movie realistic. The narrative is very engaging and doesn't bore you a bit. Special kudos to the sound effects team as their work reminds you of the movie when you hear the 'vroom' sound in the lanes. Finally, its worth 7000 RPM!! Go like hell!!"

"The movie does an amazing job keeping you at the edge of your seat when the races are on, it has a very good development and Christian Bale does an amazing job. The movie builds an amazing climax due to the races and even if you aren't acquainted to race cars, you are going to love this great proposal of James mangold."
The best movie of 2019!And finally a real car movie! Not like fast n furious who started as good car movies and just turned in to another action movieI want to see it again!
Christian Bale again proved to be a very great actor over here. The whole story was very good directed and the chemistry between the actors and actresses are thumbs up! Damon and Bale definitely nailed it.
"I love racing history, the old races, the grit of the track. This film exceeded my expectations, since most productions coming out of Hollywood have to add the political correctness aspects. Thankful for a straight-up story of racing history without the in your face propaganda. Excellent film, highly recommended."
"When you see ""v"" or ""vs"" in the title of the movie you naturally assume that it would be about a rivalry between the two of the main heroes and this movie can disappoint a lot considering it's absolutely not about that. But if you put aside a misleading title you can have a lot of fun along the way. Matt Damon and Christian Bale are a hell of a team and you enjoy every second of their truly outstanding performances. Bale delivering his lines in his native British accent nails it perfectly whereas Damon's attempts at southern accent executed not always flawlessly but still very good; overall the movie feels really unimportant, with no clear meaning behind it - it is a part of the big company's history and not much of a story in my opinion. We don't see the characters grow, their backgrounds don't change; the only thing that's impressive besides the two main actors are race car sequences but we can watch the sports channel for that which makes this all in all good movie absolutely unnecessary to watch."
"""Ford v Ferrari"" (2019 release; 152 min.) brings the true story of the showdown at the 24 hrs of LeMans in 1966. As the movie opens, we see Carroll Shelby in a flashback win the 1959 LeMans. We then go forward a few years when Henry Ford II address the Ford factory floor asking for some good new ideas. Up-and-coming executive Lee Iacocca suggests buying the struggling Ferrari car manufacturer but the deal fails. In a parallel story, we get to know rebel driver Ken Miles.... At this point we are less than 15 minutes into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest film from director James Mansfield (The Wolverine; Logan). Here he brings to the screen the heated rivalry between two very different giants in the car industry: Ford and Ferrari. The movie starts promisingly, but pretty soon we are bogged down in all kinds of corporate background and infighting that play out for way too long. Honestly, the movie could've been trimmed by 20 to 25 minutes in the movie's first half, and would not have lost any of the movie's essence. Matt Damon en Christian Bale are terrific in the lead roles of Shelby and Miles. The actual racing sequences are entertaining and loud, very loud.The movie opened wide the previous weekend, too great acclaim and box office success. I saw the movie in its second weekend of play, and the Sunday early evening screening where I saw this at was attended very nicely. Positive word of mouth will likely result in continued strong business in the weeks to come. If you have any interest in car racing, or are simply interested in a well-made and entertaining movie (even if a bit overly long for its own good), I readily suggest you check it out, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD or Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion."
"It was entertaining, but it was not the movie I had hoped for.They skipped the Mark I and Mark II entirely and went straight for the Mark III.Nothing was mentioned about all the hardships and failures - even the crashes resulting in the death of the driver - all during races Ford lost.There was no struggle to overcome. I had hoped for a movie which included the design engineering to resolve the problems.The true story is so much better!"
The two male leads do things that may. It make sense - but guys will get it. My wife enjoyed it too.
"Part of me wonders if I have stronger connection, a deeper investment to this film and the material as a born and raised Michigander that grew up immersed in automotive culture despite never really being a car person. Ford isn't just some company, it was a cornerstone of our economy and even our cultural identity. I say this because I got a legitimate rush out of this movie and when Ford is battling Ferrari I find myself wanting to get up and cheer them on.Furthermore, Bale and Damon should be in more movies together. The chemistry and the performances they deliver are exceptional. That's not to say the rest of the cast isn't pulling their weight, there are good, convincing performances all around, which does wonders for the immersion into this story.Also aiding in the immersion is the cinematography. Auto racing bores me in the real world and yet while watching this movie I found myself gripping the arm rests around the hairpin turns. As far as I'm concerned, that's an achievement of this movie, that it really draws me into what's going on.The only real drawback is in the ""villain"" who, at times is just extra awful. Aside from that though, I loved this. Definitely recommend it and, more than that, I absolutely think it's worth seeing in theaters for the full experience."
"Disappointed Ferrari was a minor theme in the movie.
Really only Enzo.
Expected character development from both teams.Ferrari racers, car models not even mentioned.
As explained in another review, Ferrari main driver quitting, not shown.
Nothing Ferrari. Just a footnote.The difference between 7000 rpm Ford vs Ferrari 9000 (8 cyl vs 12 cyl) not even mentioned.It is not Ferrari vs Ford.It was about an American company and its directors, about its icon Shelby, about its racers.
Well just one team out of 3.Really really lacking in history and confrontation."
"After what feels like an endless stream of appallingly made movies full to the brim of woke politicising, finally, finally a movie that just wants to tell a good story in a fluent and thrilling manner. Bale is absolutely perfect as Ken Miles, Damon less so as Carroll Shelby but still very decent. The racing scenes are totally engrossing, the settings are evocative and the film flies by despite coming in at more than 2:30hrs. Do yourself a favour and go see it."
"Often times this time of year it's tough to find a crowd pleasing film. The blockbusters are rare and the Oscar movies are everywhere, albeit typically a ""downer"" or more ""thought-provoking"" than something you're on the edge of your seat for. Ford v Ferrari certainly accomplishes the latter with two winning performances, sharp direction from James Mangold, and a cheer worthy true story to base it around. Heck, this movie even had some laugh out loud humor, something Christian Bale's filmography isn't full of. I would love to see him try straight comedy at some point. In all, Mangold has another win on his hands with one of the best films of the year. Here's hoping it's honored during awards season!8.9/10"
There seem to have been a lot of movies in 2019 based on factual events. This movie looks at Ford motor company's attempt to conquer the motor racing awards in the 1960's. The company was in need of some good PR in order to restore it's reputation. As with all fact based movies you are always left wondering which parts are true and which are artistic license.The movie tells the story of how the Ford team try to beat the all powerful Ferrari team. Matt Damon plays Carroll Shelby who heads up the team. His friend and lead driver is the rather unlikable Ken Miles played by Christian Bale. I've always been a big fan of Christian Bale and he's on form again here.This is a great racing movie and well worth a watch.
"What this movie does really well is get you emotionally invested in the characters, due to great acting and strong screenwriting. They built a star studded cast for this movie with Matt Damon, Christian Bale, Jon Bernthal, etc. and it really payed off with them all giving great performances. The racing scenes were exhilirating and excellently shot with great audio editing to make you feel like you're in the car with the great Ken Miles. All of this combined makes this movie easily a top 5 movie of the year for me."
"Drama - Racing movie based on actual events.Follows the rivalry in 1960's between two iconic car manufacturers.Ford wants to improve its image, so enlists Carrol Shelby to design a new sports car and gives him 90days, the objective is to beat Ferrari at Le Mans.There's great chemistry between the level-headed designer Carroll Shelby and his unpredictable, very hothead driver Ken Miles.Very exciting racing scenes with very little CGI that delivers realistic driver's perspectives, passenger perspectives, track-side perspectives and crowd perspectives.Highly recommended."
"A very nice old fashioned type of filme - one of those big Studio movies the Studios don't do that much anymore. One that really concentrates and cares for their characters and takes time to develope them. It was both storywise and also technical wise a true winner. The Performances were great. Christian Bale was just phenomenal. Especially if you consider that just last year at the same time he was playing a totally different character in ""Vice"", physically and also Motivation wise. Here he gives us an ordinary man with exatraordinary abilities and quite a tough mindset. He is great and once again proves he is one of hte most verstaile actors out there. Matt Damon was also good but definitely stayed in the shadow of Bale. Also because I think the characters were much more intersted in developing Ken than Carroll. And this is one of the very few flaws of the film. Another worth-to-mention perfomance came from Tracey Letts. and on a lesser extend Jon Bernthal.
James Mangold understood perfectly to Combine strong characters in a very solid Story with many great technical aspects to make one of a Kind of Hollywood film I dearly miss. Sound and editing were pitch perfect. The final race was one of the most exciting Moments in Cinema we had this year. And in the end it even almost brought me to Tears. A true winner Picture."
"Well done movie. Great casting. The movie moves as fast as the Shelby Ford and I didn't notice it was 2 1/2 hours. If was riveted to the story. I wonder how true to life the story is because Ford and his minions came off kinda bad. In any case, it's a great flick. Nice to see a movie today without all that condescending PC/feminism polluting the story. This felt real, not forced into today's narrow PC Hollywood storylines"
"Every minute of the movie is interesting, even if you are not a motorsports fan. Take your time and dive into a historic event, with a lot of big personalties that try to reach their dreams without losing everything they built in their life."
"'Ford v Ferrari' - underwhelming title, but exceptionally put-together sports biopic about the 24-hour endurance Le Mans motor race in 1966. If that puts you off, the good news is that the film's not all about racing - probably only ~30% - with much of the focus on Shelby (Damon), Miles (Bale) and Miles' wife, Mollie (Balfe) and son, Peter (Jupe). There's also the tension with Ferrari, where Ford executives Iacocca (Bernthal), Beebe (Lucas) and Ford (Letts) are trying to take the racing crown from Ferrari (Girone) and Agnelli (Cirfiera)It's nice to hear Bale using his actual English accent and the rapport he has with Damon carries the film. All the actors are good, but their relationship is what has you caring about what happens, rather than just the cars. The pacing is quick and it feels faster (pardon the pun) than 2.5 hours. This would be as good as, if not better than, 'Rush' and 'Senna'.Great directing from Mangold (coming off 'Logan') throughout, with a nice balance of family time, racing scenes and the car politics. The fact the 24-hour race is condensed to less than 20min and feels both quick and like it's been a marathon is a true feat. If you don't know the story, don't Google it and let the ending be a surprise. There's good editing, cinematography, authentic 60s cars and soundtrack throughout."
"Drama
I don't feel like crying from the drama in the film, the death of the protagonist is presented as something not very tragic.Soundtrack
It is terrible, it does not fit, does not immerse him in the atmosphere. Successful only the sounds of the races themselves.Scenario
There are quite a few deviations from reality, but this did not ruin the picture.Actors
No questions, so goodCharacters
In the film there are a lot of character branches, secondary characters are disclosed quite well. But Shelby is practically not disclosed. The villain is too stupidGraphic arts
Everything looks pretty good, but the camera work does not reach TaxiAtmosphere
The atmosphere of the races is well conveyed, the film immerses well"
"Interesting story overall, great acting, and a surprise ending for this true story. It would be hard to image non auto racing fans not enjoying this thrill ride."
"A story about son and father. A son who owned his dad's dream with all senses and trusted him more than anything. What a sweet fairytale! A movie about true friendship between two passionate but little crazy guy who love racing and taking challenges but not focused win only. A movie about two giant company was fighting for their glory on the mid-'60s.Le Mans '66 (Ford V Ferrari) a true story based film. A beautiful narrative of Fearless British race car driver Ken Miles and US Automobile designer & Racing Driver Carrol Shelby.Christian Bale did a mind-blowing performance again. Matt Damon was very neat and tight and delivered exactly what it demanded from the character.A MUST watch movie who likes real-life drama, challenges, determination and madness to achieve something."
"Just when you think that Hollywood has but strained all it can out of ""American underdog victory stories"", it toots out Ford vs Ferrari. Ford is struggling and bound to shut down its production line unless someone can save its ass. The idea comes, to tackle Italian giants Ferrari at the greatest endurance race, Le Mans.Enter Shelby (Damon) and Miles (Bale). Together, whilst battling their own demons, they build and drive the one and only...Mustang. The story plays out but it's both Damon and Bale that really do excel in this film. They bounce off each other with effortlessly ease, which clearly makes this an enjoyable film.Not many sports orientated films are made that are of this calibre, but every now and then you get one that hits the bullseye."
"I love this film!!! I experienced this in 4DX for the first time in Pico Rivera, California. The high price of $20.25 for admission was really worth it. 4DX put me in the driver's seat. This is a cinema technology from Korea that gives motion to a group of seats in the theater. The cinema that I attended had the seats arranged in groups of four. Imagine a roller coaster simulated in a movie theater. The seats also let you feel the rumble of the car engines and lights in the auditorium add the finishing touches such as sparks.Ford v Ferrari is a movie about the Le Mans, France 24 hour race that pitted the Ford Motor company vs. the all-time winner Ferrari. More than that, it is about the friendship between American car engineer Carroll Shelby and the unsung hero English car racer Ken Miles.Have you ever wanted to experience what it's like to be in the pilot's seat of a race car? This is the perfect film to test drive the 4DX system at a theater near you. I recommend it."
"I've been down on Hollywood lately. In that regard this film was refreshing.
This film puts an interesting perspective on LeMans, and how the US got there with the GT40.
I grew up in the 60's. I was 15 when this race occurred. Carroll Shelby was a God and the GT40 a dream.
It was a time when things could get done in this country. JFK said we're going to the moon.....we did. Carroll Shelby wanted to eat Corvettes on the track and he did with the Cobra. Henry Ford II wanted to beat Ferrari and with Shelby and Miles and the GT40 he did. Pull out the stops, damn the corporate committees, just a ""git 'er done"" mentality.
It's a fun film that doesn't get lost in the racing. It is a story of friendship, attitude, determination and yes, Le Mans.
It is also a fantastic ode to some the greatest icons of Automotive history, Shelby, Miles, Iacocca, Henry Ford II.
Go, watch and enjoy,"
"I'm not a big car racing fan when my wife dragged me to see Ford. But with all the personalities involved, I was hooked shortly into the movie, which never let me go.
Sure, the car racing action is top-notch. But what got me super interested in this were all the different characters portrayed, from Ken Miles, the iconoclastic driver/mechanic, to Carroll Shelby, the race car innovator, to yes, even the villain of the movie, Leo Beebe, Ford's marketing executive. All the gears meshed perfectly to create a palate of memorable players fighting against and with each other to achieve different goals.
Go see it, you won't be disappointed."
"Fantastic performances, fantastic cast, amazing movie!"
"This academy award star studded fact based is a must watch. Even if you are not motor racing fan, you will like the brilliant performance of Christian Bale (Playing Ken Miles a racing car engineer), Matt_Damon (Playing Carroll Shelby American automotive designer, racing driver, entrepreneur) even less familiar Jon Bernthal (Playing Lee Iacocca- man behind Mustang) will never fail to engage you. In terms of racing movies this looks more real, thrilling with great sound, excellent cinematography and meticulous directions. It's several notches ahead than fast and furious. It is now one of my favorite 5 movies.For me It's a must watch again."
It is great but it could have been shorter. Also Ken's death is sad.
"This was a good story well-executed. The casting choice of Lee Iacocca was strange to me, but acted well. Finally, finally, a viscerally good balanced story."
"I've gotta say that I came to the theatre with lower expectations since some people were complaining about the story sounding boring. I only to came to watch because it had two of my favorite actors in it, Christian Bale and Matt Damon. After the movie was done, I was blown away.The story is exactly what it says, but those words can't describe the experience of watching this. Right away you get to know the characters and they're not so generic as I thought they would be. Christian Bale was the best part of this film, and his performance is very compelling. It feels totally separate from what he was in the Dark Knight and American Psycho.As time passes, the stakes get much higher. There are always barriers added along the way, whether it's the dangerous conditions of racing or the people involved in it. You will definitely love some characters and hate some as well (you'll know who I'm talking about).This is the ideal drama we should keep getting from Hollywood. The performances by Bale and Damon are fantastic, and this'll bring many awards."
"Watched this in IMAX, incredible. Its the true story about one of our nation's most successful people, a revered racer and the legendary American race car that won the most prestigious race in the world 4 times over. Amazing acting and very genuine."
"Christian Bale is one of the most ironclad, reliable actors on the planet. You pair him with the equally reliable Matt Damon and the well cast, sleazeball-ing Josh Lucas and you get a spot-on, co-starring team. Damon and Bale don accents and trade torque/throttle in Ford v Ferrari (my latest review).Ford v Ferrari's true story goes like this: A car designer named Carroll Shelby (Damon) and a hard-edged race car driver named Ken Miles (Bale), try to best Enzo Ferrari's souped-up automobiles via the 1966 Le Mans. In truth, Ford v Ferrari is a longing film that ends on a down note but it's not without a touch of energy and the almighty whimsical.Ford v Ferrari's running time flies by even at 152 minutes. Most of these minutes involve mild emotion undercut with some heart-pounding, endurance race sequences. If you like a superior sense of time and place, then Ford v Ferrari will give you your mid 60s fix. And if you wanna see a more sophisticated version of say, Days of Thunder, then Ford v Ferrari will make you forget about that commercialized, Tom Cruise vehicle (no pun intended).Directed by New Yorker James Mangold with its vroom vroom scenes shot at ground level, Ford v Ferrari is the type of flick that needs to be seen with the best movie theater sound system possible. Mangold knows how to film racing action no doubt. He avoids all the Fast & Furious BS and instead opts for minimal flash and loads of stash. Yup, it's about the clamor here. You can hear the fuel burning, the tires screeching, the engine humming, the studs spinning, and the racers rubbing. It's decibel, ear orgasmic.Now Ford v Ferrari does fail to fully flesh out its 2-3 main characters (that's rare for a 2 and a half hour pic). And yeah, the film's first half has a lot more collared, dramatic momentum. Still, with smooth direction by James Mangold, some capable editing by Michael McCusker, some sleek rides, and a bleached out, beach blanket be-bop look, Ford v Ferrari provides the viewer with an old-world night at the cineplex. Call it ""stampede for speed"". Rating: 3 stars."
Just amazing. Does not get much better than that. Jason Bourne vs batman in the street with wonderbread! Amazin!
"My Rating : 6/10Extremely average movie, OK for a one-time viewing.The high ratings are absolutely fake according to me.Just 'good'."
"Bale (Driver) and Damon (Car designer) spun magic on the viewers with their tremendous chemistry, stellar performance which seems very real ! Bale's acting requires a special mention which seems to make the movie even more top class ! Great story and portrayal .. The cars roaring on the tracks will linger for sometime .."
"You'll laugh, suffer, love, and feel every corner raced. It is an accurate story, and the cast is near perfect. I'd see it again!"
Perfect actors for the role! Can't say anything but a great movie
Breath of fresh for the film industry. Really enjoyed this one... I regret watching it on a small screen!!!
"Great movie Amazing performance and acting, The Amazing soundtrack"
I love this movie from first minute. Amazing acting and chemistry between Mat and Bale. i lost trust that the American Cinema will come with amazing movie but here we are with this masterpiece. i think this will own Oscar.
"When you accept that this is a mainstream movie you enjoy the (real) story and racing scenes. We can complain about how we get to see main character's life so little even his devastation at some point. However, they did really great job on racing scenes. Only thing that i can complain about is that the ending could be more painful to win(maybe some suspense). It was kinda all about victories throughout the whole movie and nothing really bad happened. But yea anyway it was fun to see."
"An old-fashioned Hollywood movie with great performances and exciting racing sequences.Them testing the car and clashing with Ford executives is fine, but the movie really is at its best when it focuses on racing. Even then, the performances from Bale and Damon are so good that they make even the rockiest parts of movie watchable.The third act is so much fun it mostly makes up for many problems I might have had with the build-up.It feels like the movie is a big allegory for movie studio interference and how it can prevent greatness. I like that, even if even comes with the cost of makong the Ford and Ferrari execs feel like cartoon villains, but then again, old-fashioned Hollywood movie.This was a lot fun."
"They should do a Sequal about the accomplishments that Carroll Shelby did later until he cross the river, like he used to say
I own the Last car built by Carroll Shelby, that beat Ferrari. . GT350- R Concept. Built by Shelby and Ford racing Team to beat modern Supercars in 2011.
After they won, They interview Carrol, he said... I'm so happy, I am ready to cross the River........
Months later, the Legendary Carroll Shelby Passed Away.
If they do a sequel, that would be a great ending. Carroll on the track, doing what he loves. Beating Ferrari one last time. The image freezes. Letters come out on top...... Months later........ the Legendary Carroll Shelby passed. Away. He did what he loved til the end....."
Its fun and all but it lacks the real story and the tension.. thats where it lacks.. it's fun.. but.. not accurate.. if u can get me
"With a gripping story, interesting characters, AAA acting, pitch perfect sound design and some of the most visceral racing action put to screen, FORD V FERRARI is an incredibly well oiled machine!"
"This is a very good film about the battle between ford vs ferrai leading up to Le Mans in 1966. It also is about the evolving friendship of Caroll Shellby played really well by Matt Damon and the great Ken Miles played brilliantly by Christian Bale. This film has some great racing scenes in it but it is more about the board room scenes and how companies battle each other. There are some thrilling scenes, great acting and dialogue and great music. Damon and Bale really played well off each other and this was a very entertaining film. I do recommend it. I think it will be remembered come Oscar time"
"This was all round a really good movie, it was funny, emotional, exciting and interesting all at once. The characters felt real and managed to capture genuine human interactions and it all built to provide a very emotional ending.The sets were great and really gave you a feeling of being back in the 60's and there were some very interesting little tidbits thrown in showing how ww2 had left its scar on many people. It did this while maintaining a careful view of its priorities, it wasnt there to tell you what the 60's were but to use it as a backdrop for a real story.The acting was superb throughout, Damon really gave a strong performance and Bale really managed to convey well the good and bad character traits with real respect for the person he was representing. Also, although Caitriona Balfe was playing a supporting role I think her performance really needs to be called out. Caitriona managed to portray real strength and respect in a female character, she never went around screaming she was better than men, she instead portrayed real emotions, real reactions and genuine heart. I felt her supporting role was very well done too.Overall this felt like a movie which had some respect for its audiences intelligence and managed to really provide both genuine escapism and tell a very interesting and engaging story. Highly recommended viewing."
"There comes a moment in one's (professional) life when one's own passion, drive, skill, and one's immediate team and opportunity - all line-up. Few of us are able to embrace that chance to become the best versions of ourselves and set benchmarks for generations to follow. This movie celebrates that spirit of pursuit of perfection at one's craft both individually and as a team.Caroll Shelby & Phil Remington built and Ken Miles raced the Ford Shelby GT 40 which defeated the most brilliantly engineered cars at the time - The Ferrari in the most demanding and enduring race in the world - 24 hours of LeMans in 1966 and it went on to win for 4 consecutive years. And to date, it remains the only American car to do so.Yes, the movie has all the adrenaline pumping, engine revving, nail-biting action that we expect from a race car movie. But it goes much beyond that by bringing out the amazing comradery and personal journeys of Caroll Shelby and Ken Miles. It shows how a small team of committed and talented people who set themselves an impossible target can actually make God (Ferrari) bleed by sheer will power, raw talent, and good old hard work. It also beautifully shows how family believes in you when others give up.Christian Bale and Matt Damon are impeccable.Visuals are awesome, all real cars, real drivers, shot from the perspective of the driver - Behind the wheel and on the track. Above all, the perfect harmony of man and machine with endurance is on display here.Guys, this is the one to watch on IMAX !"
"It is a car film so you need to be a little into that but also so Office films.
It is a good movie, i liked it."
Surprised a car movie would have these goofs! (They should use me to screen vehicles.)
"This is a great biopic that tells a compelling story between the American and Italian car makers in one of the toughest races in the world. As a person who likes cars and has a passing familiarity with Le Mans and car mechanics, I thought this move was excellent for people who only had a surface level knowledge of these things and had plenty for every type of movie goer.Damon and Bale are obviously excellent, with Bale donning a proper English accent and lots of eccentricity and Damon pulling off the forced retired racer and now car designer smoothly. The supporting cast was extremely well done, with special call outs to Tracy Letts, who played an absolutely excellent Henry Ford II and had one of the best scenes in the entire movie. His ability to display such a wide range of emotions really sold the audience to how invested he was in this character. Caitriona Balfe as Mollie Miles, Bale's character's wife, was also excellent. She has a few of her own scenes where she steals the show and is the perfect compliment to Bale's character's own ad hoc lifestyle at times.In fact, most of the scenes involving Ford Execs were so good that they warrant their own biopic with their own characters. The political battle between Ford's VPs was interesting and infuriating at the same time, showing repeatidly that they are their own worst enemy.In terms of direction, this movie was executed well. Conscious decisions were made to have Italian dialogue not translated in certain scenes, allowing the audience really understand visually the scenes without giving it away. Most shots are very clean and the driving sections are well done to build tension while also not becoming boring.The movie does throw a lot of you in terms of details, mentions of gearboxes, lift, brake roters, tire swaps, etc... all show that a proper gear head would enjoy the jargon. The Ford GT40 in general really shines here and takes center stage multiple times in the film. There is one particular scene where Damon's character take the car for a spin and you really do understand the absolute power behind the car and its eventual final designs that lead it to be successful.At over 2.5 hours, this movie does not leave anything out and truly does tell the compelling story of the Americans at Le Mans. Overall the movie comes well recommend and is definitely worth a watch."
"Fantastic movie!! Christian Bale nailed his portrayal as Ken Miles. Worth every penny. Far too good from Rush.
May be the best Racing movie ever made.
A must watch movie, and guys u should go for it without any hesitation.."
"CHRISTIAN BALE. CHRISTIAN BALE. Yes, Matt Damon was good, but CHRISTIAN BALE! He completely became Ken Miles, and he was mesmerizing! After Vice and then this, you can see what an incredible actor he is, with an unmatched range. The movie was directed very well, and had great scenes of race car driving. I also loved it for what it lacked...no gratuitous sex, violence, etc, that permeate today's movies. Just a great story! Do yourself a favor and see this movie!"
"""Ford v Ferrari"" juggles enough fast cars, heart and fine performances to entertain you all the way through.
.
In this sports drama based on a true story, a team of determined engineers make it a mission to build a Ford vehicle fast enough to beat Ferrari in the 24 Hours of Le Mans.
.
Running a little over two and a half hours, ""Ford v Ferrari"" can be tighter, but the film overall is a fun ride and a solid underdog story. Matt Damon and Christian Bale are a dynamic duo and offer viewers two whole-hearted and grand performances. Director James Mangold (""Walk The Line"") makes you feel like you're on that race track and also makes you want to stand up and cheer. An entertaining piece of automotive history that not many people know about and well worth the watch."
"This movie makes me hate Ford. I wish I would've known that this has a sad ending, I would not have gone to see it. Very disappointing movie."
This movie was so good that everything in it was perfect. Hats off to all cast and crews. All the action sequence were amazing and the plot was also moving with character development. James Mangold once again proves himself as a superfine director.
"ALMOST everything about this movie was so good. The acting, the dialogue, the sound design, the cars! It also just looks so beautiful. Whatever is shown on screen matches with the tone at all times, and the colours are gorgeous throughout. The sound track was also really good, especially during the race, and the race scenese had clutching my palms the entire time.The thing is, though, the story is just so weak! To me, the ending is just super depressing without reason. A tragic ending like that should feel deserved, but it didn't. If the movie ended with Miles losing first place, it would been a bittersweet ending, but I felt like they had to just shove his death in there. (Why is there a major plot point in the falling action?) I usually get so emotional during movies, but I literally felt nothing here.They changed the story so much already, couldn't they have just changed it a lil' more to make narrative sense? I really wanted to like it because I'm such a big fan of the actors, but the more I thought about the story, the less sense it made to me."
"I only know a little about cars and I effing love it! Ford v Ferrari is a movie that non race cars fans can experience such thrilling historical moments and I'm sure they'll enjoy it.I heard that this American sports drama was adapted from a memoir called The Carroll Shelby Story which was published in 1967 by Pocket Books. The memoir describes his days as a race car driver, the challenges, the victories, and the crashes--the worst of which he describes as an ""explosion."" The memoir also discusses the genesis for the revolutionary car he created, the Shelby Cobra. In Chapter 21, Shelby describes his life changing win at Le Mans in 1966 with driver Ken Miles against rival car manufacturer, Ferrari. (Anyway, this passage contains a little bit of spoiler, although in fact, it's not. It's merely a flash info I got from wikipedia right after I got out of the cinema and mesmerized).I like the idea of how Shelby and Miles are really the heroes of the story. Their relationship in the movie is spot on, portrayed really good by James Mangold and his team. My only complaint about this film is that, unfortunately, their in-depth story (relationship and adventure) wasn't dug deeper. We get to see the huge intrigue between two corporations. But that doesn't ruin the whole story. This drama is based on true event of an unsung hero. I didn't know all the true story until I watched this epic biopic the other night. I'm happy that I learned something from this movie. Even Matt Damon himself--in one of his interviews along with Christian Bale--didn't know the real story till he read the script. The way I see it, this film's not about winning or losing; this is all about ""achieving the goal"". I'm so impressed. It's totally worth to watch. No, it's actually a highly recommended film of 2019. Go ahead and see it in imax for better experience!"
"Went into this movie knowing almost nothing at all. I knew the two main actor, Christian bale and Matt Damon and that it was a true story about a race between Ford Vs Ferrari in a le mans 1996 race but I had no idea what happened or how it went down! However this movie was amazing for me and it told a story which was oh so much more than just a race. The chemistry between the two load roles were fantastic and really shined through, not even scared to say I may of shed a little tear during this movie! Defitnaly worth a watch for anyone who wants to be inspired."
"Even though this is a movie about motor racing, specifically Le Mans, I found that even non-enthusiasts would enjoy it. It's about the journey Shelby and Miles go on. The 2 hours 30 minutes don't feel like a drag which is a testament to the flow of the movie.Matt Damon was really good as Carroll Shelby, I mean really good. Christian Bale as Ken Miles on the other hand, phenomenal. Oscar worthy performance as he completely throws himself fully in the role.The sound mixing and editing just felt on point and could well be award winning too.Go out to watch it, it's worth the hype and lives up to the trailer."
"Well written and almost similar to the true events. Enjoyed the movie, matt damon and christian bale played their parts brilliantly."
"Fact"" if you wanna watch this movie You don't need to know anything about cars , this Is a true story is not all about Racing, though ;
The title should be Miles And Shelby and the rest vs Ferrari ,
""Miles"" played played by the one and only Christian Bale who delivers one of the best performance this year outstanding,
""Shelby, Matt Damon on his top as always
Breathtaking Movie From the beginning to the end gives you that kinda boost that kind energy you want as a viewer , just wonderful movie !! Bravo!!
One more point to the director Amzing Job Sir ."
You must watch this incredible movie. Everything is perfect.
If you saw this Movie With IMax sound you know exactly why i am giving this 10 stars
"Loved it! Matt Damon was particularly strong, his face can say so much in the expressions, and facial movements that speech isn't needed.
I did laugh at the 'fight scene' as it was reminiscent of The Bourne films!! 🤣
Really great story, acting, photography, well done x
Working out who I can take so I can see it again."
"During certain scenes in the movie my heart was pounding so hard and breath was literally taken away. I didn't expect that intensity and masterful director's work, but even after 8 hours I am still contemplating the stuff seen.
Easily 10/10"
"My first review was for the movie Andhadhun. After a year, this is my second review. Ford vs Ferrari is a gripping movie till the end. Better to not watch the trailers before you watch the movie."
I cant say much.. Bale's role as Ken Miles is so fantastic and memorable.. He must compete with Phoenix in Academy Award for the best actor..
"As a petrol head I suppose I'm biased and although I wouldn't have chosen the two main actors in their roles I'm so glad they did as both were just brilliant. From start to finish it was telling the story but without any frills bells or whistles. It's a story of friendship and passions when a lump of metal with a beautiful sounding engine grips you and becomes part of your life. The photography was as it should be and wonderfully put together. I saw this at an I MAX sitting at the back and with accompanying soundtrack made my day. I'm sure the purists will find fault somewhere but for me seeing a picture like this, in this format is what it's all about and ticked all of my boxes."
This was an awesome movie to see with my sons and talk about for hours later. You feel like you are right there with them through ups and downs.You also feel the rush and the speed of the cars.Just a great movie all around and so much fun.
"Two words....Timeless epic! Went into this movie thinking it was another attempt to use a star studded cast to take my money and grab my Interest. That's exactly what it was and I've never been happier. Film is expertly written, expertly performed and expertly directed. One of those once in every two years kind of film, one you can pull out on a rainy night in 10 years from now and be ever so glad you did. It Is long....it is a typical testosterone film....but it's so worth the watch!!!!! Brilliant!!!!"
"This is a great film in its own right and even as fiction would be superb but as a true story it is truly compelling watching. When I saw the length of the film I thought I bet there is 20 minutes they could have cut out but I was wrong, the film goes by like it's 10 minutes long with not a minute wasted.Damon and Bale are brilliant in their roles, both should be up for oscars, Bale in particular really makes the character and is almost unrecognisable. The CGI is great while not getting in the way of the film and even the sound is fantastic.Is it the greatest motor racing film of all time? It has to be in with a shout and I can't wait to see it again."
"I will be honest... I was totally blank while entering the theatre... I did not even know that it was based on a true story! It was after the movie was over I searched for it on Google coz the movie felt so real.
I went in because of Christian Bale and Matt Damon and I wasn't disappointed. In fact it exceeded my expectations. I am not that big of a speed/race kind of person but damn I loved every single minute of the movie from start to end... The performances stand out, the Direction is perfect and the seemless CGI effects and stunts used made me wonder how did they even shoot those racing sequences with that level of continuity... All in all this is one of the best movies this year. Definitely go check it out on the big screen!!!"
"As an ex NASCAR driver, I was excited to see this movie, and it didn't disappoint at all!
Truly well done movie, really drew you in and made you feel like part of the story, and Christian Bale's performance was perfect for the part, and really I couldn't think of a better actor for the part...
This movie made me want to race again...!
This is a must see movie...the best of the year in my opinion!"
"I have never written a review here before, but this movie inspired me so much, I just had to say something. FvF felt so much like my all time favorite movie, ""The Right Stuff,"" I was duly impressed. The acting, the cinematography, the script and direction were just spot on. I at first didn't want to see it because I absolutely hate Christian Bale, but his performance IMHO was Oscar-worthy. The racing scenes were exciting and visceral, the CG locations were perfect; everything about this movie just drew me in. I highly recommend FvF for the whole family!"
"So good! We loved it. The history was great, the cars were so cool."
WHAT A GREAT MOVIE!!! This is what movie theaters were made for! It grabs on & holds you until the very end. Bale & Damon are fantastic together. The sound effects engulf you. I was laughing & crying....it has something for everybody.
"I watched this film in IMAX to get the full experience. The racing was thrilling to watch, it feels like you're there rooting for the main character to win. I recommend watching this movie!"
One of the best racing movies I've seen. Must see. 10/10
This movie is a roller coaster ride from start to end it will bind you. Christian Bale is outstanding in this movie. Matt Demon and Christian Bale steals the show. Go for it a must watch for everyone.
"What a movie!! Amazing acting, super script, great direction.
BALE has did it again, unbelievable act by him once again.
BALE & DAMON works as a team, which will hold you to your chair."
"James Mangold is a great director and has given us amazing films like Walk the Line and his last film Logan which has impressed us immensely. His newest film, Ford v Ferrari, is another entertaining and well made film that adds to Mangold's filmography.Ford v Ferrari tells the story of car designer Carroll Shelby and driver Ken Miles who build a race car for Ford in order to defeat Ferrari at the 24 hour race known as Le Mans in 1966.This movie is one of the best of the year which audiences and car enthusiasts will enjoy throughout. You can tell how much care and effort was put into this project once you watch the film. The racing sequences were really well shot and a blast to witness. None of it felt fake or seemed like a CGI fest because of how practical everything seemed. It must have been really difficult to film those scenes but the crew pulled it off beautifully. The overall look of the movie was gorgeous. It really captured the essence of the time period this film is set in which contributed to the authenticity of everything shown.The acting from everyone was amazing. Matt Damon gives a solid performance and his partner in crime, Christian Bale, also provides the same result. Both stars have great chemistry with each other and are a joy to see. Jon Bernthal was also great as well as the rest of the supporting cast.The film clocks in at 2 hours and 30 minutes but it didn't feel like that all. The first half did drag a little bit as it mainly consisted of business meetings and proposals but it doesn't affect the pacing much. Once the racing starts, the time flies. James Mangold does an excellent job directing especially during the racing scenes which flowed well and was easy to watch. He adds a level of intensity to them through the visuals rather than using loud music or crazy slo-mo which I admire. The screenplay had great moments of character and a surprising amount of funny dialogues. Not once did it feel boring.I have to admit I wasn't expecting Ford v Ferrari to be THIS good! The characters were engaging, the acting was spot on, the races felt intense and the aesthetics were great. If this film were to be nominated at the Oscars, I wouldn't mind. Hats off to everyone who worked on the movie as they gave it their all."
Ford take challenge and fulfill on the hard work of Ken and Shelby. But ken didn't get the credit because of their cleverness. It was a wonderful racing movie. I started feeling like they are part of my family and it's wrong with Ken and Shelby. But the truth is today no one knows who won the race everyone know Ken. So his sacrifice is taken care of.
"Simply put, I LOVE this movie. Bale and Damon are next level, Mangold's direction is at his best, and the supporting cast is brilliant. If you do not know the story before going in, DO NOT RESEARCH. This was a story I had no idea about before hand and it blew my mind watching it unfold. If I have maybe 2 flaws, I wish some sympathy could have been put on Ferrari, as they seem like the stereotypical ""bad guy"" in the movie, and the 2nd half-hour does drag just smidge. Overall, in the words of Christian Bale's Ken Miles-- ""It's bloody brilliant!"""
"Both leads are just amazing. First half is bit slow but the second half is great. I'll definitely tell others to watch it. Go for it. Lovely Biographical movie. Bale and Demon both are just perfect in the role. After Rush (2013) i find this movie great. Nicely written and directed. Loved the way of screenplay. Short review because reviews can't explain the movie or the direction/good or bad part of the movie. It's just about the taste of what you like. (sorry for bad English) - itsbymayank

"Released in the U.K. and other markets under the far better title, Le Mans '66, Ford v Ferrari is an exhilarating biopic telling of Ford's attempts to challenge and outdo the beloved cars of genius Enzo Ferrari in the world famous French 24 hour motor marathon.Seeking the prestige of the Ferrari badge, Henry Ford II (Tracy Letts), is humiliatingly rebuffed in his attempt to buy a controlling interest in the Italian motor manufacturer. In a fit of pique, he orders his executives to create a car that can turn the tables on Ferrari. Retired racing car driver now designer, Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon), is engaged by Ford executive Lee Iacocca (Jon Bernthal) to do just that. Shelby in turn recruits the cantankerously bloody-minded British racing driver Ken Miles (Christian Bale) to put his foot to the floor and hopefully secure the chequered flag. The project is to be overseen by Ford Senior Vice President Leo Beebe (Josh Lucas).The film is centred on the dynamic between Shelby and Miles, their awkward relationship and history of confrontation ameliorating as they are both driven, no pun intended, to achieve victory. Their efforts are constantly frustrated by the unhelpful and self-serving Leo Beebe following his own agenda.Direction from James Mangold (Walk the Line) and cinematography from Phedon Papamichael are both first rate. The racing scenes are truly immersive and you smell the octane. Screenplay from the British pair Jez and John-Henry Butterworth with American Jason Keller, never gets bogged down in technical detail, it simply allows the story to flow, a story so engaging that the running time of two and a half hours never flags; it's not just for petrol heads. And it says much of Matt Damon's progression as a film actor that he easily holds his own in his many scenes with Christian Bale. Irish actor Caitriona Balfe as Miles's wife Mollie provides a strong foil to her husband's headstrong ways.Is the film slightly formulaic with stock characters? Maybe so, perhaps. Henry Ford II is shown as a bombastic bully, Leo Beebe an unctuous Uriah Heep-style sycophant. But when all other aspects of a film come together, who cares? Besides, most people love pantomime villains. And whether unwittingly or not, the film shows that maverick genius needs the boring business acumen and the politics inevitably attached to succeed. Both Shelby and particularly Miles are shown as pretty hopeless in their business dealings, neither would've got a car anywhere near Le Mans without the bean counters from Ford. The film is also mercifully free of modern day political analogies, concentrating instead on telling its tale without distraction.I have a feeling this film will become a perennial public holiday favourite.4.5*"
"Just back from the theater after seeing Ford vs. Ferrari and it's totally enjoyable. It never dragged and never really felt rushed either. Matt Damon and Christian Bale are two of the most watchable moviestars we have on hand these days, and their interaction can easily be seen as the bedrock of the movie.The racing scenes? We get pretty well all you could wish from the famous 1966 races at Daytona and LeMans where the Ford GT Mk II made its mark in racing history. I think in screen time they add up to almost an hour's worth of the 2:32 runtime of the movie, and they're filmed as well as (or better than) any other racing movie I can think of. Full disclosure here though: I personally think auto racing is obscene most of all because of its flagrant waste of fossil fuels, and anyone who argues that it's responsible for all kinds of auto design improvements is just blowing smoke. If and when this whole sport dies its inevitable death, good riddance.But OK, this is a movie review -- how about the cast? Matt Damon is just fine as always. He doesn't exactly have ""range"" -- he just plays himself in any movie (like Tom Cruise) -- but that's just fine. I have no idea if Carrol Shelby is really like that, but Damon is so comfortable and engaging in whatever he does that it always works. Christian Bale is much more of a technician, a method actor, and I'm sure he worked hard to nail the eccentric Ken Miles, the race driver and engineer/mechanic who values the pure experience of the business on absolute terms. It's fascinating to see him work.Two or three of the minor parts stand out. Catriona Balfe (best known for ""Outlander"") plays Miles' wife and gives her some depth -- much more than just a placeholder. And Tracy Letts (as Henry Ford II), Jon Bernthal (as a young Lee Iacocca) and Josh Lucas (as the smarmy, vindictive corporate suit Leo Beebe) are all good. I don't have any idea how much of the infighting and scheming within the Ford corporation shown here is realistic, though I suspect much of it must be fictionalized to amp up the drama. But it makes for an engaging night out. Have fun!"
"This is the ROCKY of car racing movies.You'll smile, you'll cheer, you'll laugh, you'll pump your fist, and by the end, you might even cry.Matt Damon and Christian Bale are reliably great, and the racing scenes adrenaline-:inducingly exciting.Highly entertaining, highly recommended."
"Back in the 1960s, Ferrari's racing team was the one to beat on the track. This is the story of how Ford Motor Company took on Ferrari in 1966 and won, with the help of automotive designer Carroll Shelby and race driver Ken Miles. The Ford team constructed the formidable GT40 which emerged victorious at the 24 Hours of Le Mans. Those who were previously unaware or oblivious of this juicy bit of history will find themselves captivated by its reenactment on celluloid. The film runs two and a half hours, yet it does not drag, thanks to a tight script and solid performances, superbly-edited racing sequences along with a music score that enhances the action onscreen. Matt Damon once again proves why he is one of the finest actors of his generation; he is absolutely spot-on in his portrayal of Shelby as a man with passion, confidence and determination. I love watching him in movies like this one and also Invictus. Christian Bale's performance as Ken Miles, while a little more mannered, still manages to beautifully capture the character's extremes of tenderness and cockiness. Also noteworthy is Tracy Letts as Henry Ford II; he shows that the magnate can have a commanding presence yet break down upon experiencing an epiphany. Ford v Ferrari brings a nugget of racing history to life through this well-assembled movie which is worth catching especially on the big screen."
"Plot writing was great from start to finish. They didn't missed every detail from the truth event. They told the story perfectly from point A to B. The character development was great for Carroll Shellby and Ken Miles character. I'm not sure about Leo Bebee character cause I found him just another cliche movie villain. The dialogue written perfectly well.The cast performance was great and engaging. Matt Damon and Christian Bale did a great job as their character. I really enjoyed their chemistry in this movie. They nailed their character perfectly without any flaws.The action sequence was great and perfectly shot. No CGI,no shaky cam, and not messy cut. That's what I can describe for the racing scene. You really need to experience better on cinema by the way.The cinematography looks beautiful especially during the Le Man's race scene.Overall, this is probably best racing car movie since Rush."
"Great acting! OMG! Every actor/actress was on point, absolutely no dull moments! Finally a real story about real people, real super heroes! And real villains! Our family loved it and we've been talking about the most memorable scenes ever since. Well thought out. The movie is genius. More like this please!"
"I learned this has very little CGI. I was sure to watch this in a theatre with great sound. Man was I happy about the decision, a fantastic movie with great history to be learned. Even if you aren't a car but, this is a moving and at times funny story with amazing actors and scenes, extremely well put together. Question is, when can I go watch it again?"
"To fully enjoy the racing scene, thus movie needs to be scene on the big screen. Jumped out of my seat on a couple of car collisions. Christian Bale & Matt Damon deserve Oscar nominations, but I give the nod to Bale."
"Le Mans '66 is a new sports biography directed by James Mangold, director of Logan and Walk the Line.In the film, the American car designer Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) is asked by car company Ford if he wants to make a racing car for the company, so that they can participate in car racing so that they can also sponsor their company in this car world. Ford also hopes to be able to compete more with the Ferrari car company. They try to do this during the 24-hour Le Mans race. To have a good chance against Ferrari, they also have to find a suitable driver. Carroll proposes to ask British driver Ken Miles (Christian Bale) to race for Ford. Ken Miles has a passion for cars and racing, but is also somewhat rebellious. For example, he does not seem the right driver to promote Ford in a positive way with their brand and new racing cars. Shelby and his race crew see that Ken is the only one who has a real chance to successfully drive the Ford race car and a real chance to win the race. Shelby and his crew now have to decide to stay true to Ford's rules with another driver, or to keep the race with Ken Miles as a driver, so they have a chance to win the 24-hour Le Mans race.
For a true story, James Mangold knows how to tell the film in an interesting way. You also don't need to have any knowledge about car racing or the true events of Le Mans '66 to be able to follow and understand the story. You will receive the necessary information in the film. If you are familiar with all or a few of these things, there is more to enjoy in the film, because there are enough jokes and comical references in the film for the connoisseurs. The race scenes are also filmed as if you were in the car as a driver or passenger as a viewer. Thanks to the sound effects of the racing cars, it also feels as if you are actually watching a race or you are actually participating in the scenes in the car.The film is not really about the battle between car companies Ford and Ferrari. This is part of the film, but the film is more about the fight that the car designer and racer have against the company's board members, which they must keep satisfied. This film shows so beautifully how people sometimes have to choose to continue to follow their passion and own thinking. Or that they neatly follow the rules of the company and the manager, even if they have to put aside their passion and their own ideas. Apart from the race, they also know how to create excitement in the film with the different choices that the characters face. As a viewer you usually do not know which choice is the best and which is ultimately taken by the characters. The film also shows how heavy people are who are slightly different from society due to poor health or a developmental disorder such as PTSD. Despite In the face of these handicaps, they still have to follow certain rules of society, which is not always easy for them.The acting is also good and credible in the film. Christian Bale steals the film as Ken Miles a car and racing enthusiast, who looks with critical eyes at how others treat their cars or drive their racing. He knows how to share his critical opinion in comical ways with the other characters in the film. For this role he deserves to be nominated for various film prizes such as an Oscar. Matt Damon also does good acting as a car designer and later as the boss of a racing crew, trying to keep both the rebellious driver and the strict Ford board members happy. For this, he must choose one of the two, which often leads to conflicts. Although the two sometimes go against each other, they still have good chemistry thanks to their shared passion for cars and racing. The rest of the cast such as Josh Lucas, John Bernthal and Ray McKinnon also provide appropriate acting as members of the race crew or corporate management."
"Car enthusiasts should enjoy the movie, great racing scenes, superb acting by all, awesome cars and as it's based on a true story you may learn some historical facts too which was interesting and prompted me to do some more research on the events after watching the film, well done A+"
"Friendship, family, little guys v. Corporate hacks, and the most exhilarating car race depictions you're likely to see. Bale & Damon at their best; Balfe & Jupe fleshing out roles that give the story depth, rather than filler; terrific performances by all supporting cast; writing, production, direction are all top notch. I very much enjoyed this film, and can't wait to see it again."
"Without any spoiler and long talk, this is the movie of the year. Go watch it if you haven't already"
"Wow!!!!it is not one of the best,it is the best as far me"
"Ford v Ferrari is the most average and mediocre film to release at this point in the year. There is nothing great, good, bad, or terrible about this movie. It's just okay. But considering that great movies do exist, mediocre movies feel unsatisfying by comparison.The acting is by far the best part of the film. Matt Damon is amazing, Christian Bale is pretty great, and everyone else is just average, which is disappointing considering the notable cast. The child acting wasn't all that good.The writing is pretty unspecial and average. It takes the classic American underdog trope and does pretty much nothing original with it. There's almost nothing to say on this subject because of how little substance the writing has.The editing was alright but nothing special. The shot composition was alright but nothing special. The soundtrack... I've already forgotten everything about it, only a day after it came out. The adr was super noticeable and terribly implemented.Watch this if you are into racing or this story in particular, but for me it felt like a futile attempt at sweeping the Oscars."
"I live 70 miles from the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. Our yearly family gathering from Orlando, KY & NE come for the Indy 500, NOT Christmas like most families, so YES, we're race fans. I saw this opening night with my son & 11yo grandson who could say ""Helio Castroneves"" clearly before he could say ""oatmeal."" From the beginning, it shows the thrill of those who truly live & love the sport and ONLY stop driving when they must yet stay involved in whatever way they can to BETTER IT, using their unique talents, come hell or high water. Does age stop them? Nah, not when you have the needed talent and a friend who believes in you...BUT even he also has to bow to ""corporate culture"" at times to get to where he ultimately wants to be. He knows he'll be ABLE to. He just has to wait for HIS right moment. You'll LOVE IT when he does! It makes you realize if you have special talents, you may need to wait for the right moment to make your move for success to come but then it will. What IS success in the end?"
Story was really good but the editing and scenes seemed out of place. The background music was horrible.
"****** Warning mild spoilers ******.
I have always been critical of the 1971 Le Mans movie mainly due to the seemingly tacked on love story presumably put in on the behest of the studio to make it a movie rather than a documentary of the 1970 Le Mans race.However now that I have seen the latest Le Mans movie I have a nostalgic yearning for a movie with a pointless incomprehensible love story sparingly threaded in between fantastic racing footage and non CGI stunt work.Which is the complete opposite to what you get in Le Mans 66 which has instead threaded rather sparsely CGI heavy Le Mans racing footage in to a Bale/Damon star vehicleAt nearly 3 hours long it feels like watching a less than classic year at the 24 hours of Le Mans in its entirety, the story of how Henry Ford 2nd anger at Enzo Ferrari's apparent deception in Fords attempt to buy Ferrari is over simplified and rushed which would leave a viewer who had little or no knowledge of the true story behind the film baffled as to why Henry Ford was enraged enough to throw so much money at the GT40 project.Anyway eventually about just over half the movie run time we get to Le Mans in 1966 and we start to get what we paid for 'classic cars racing in a classic race' albeit CGI'd to the max.My advice wait for the movie to get on the streaming sites so you can fast forward through the porridge."
"""Ford v Ferrari"" is a new American/French co-production that is mostly in the English language and this could be one of the big players this award season. The director is James Mangold and with ""Walk the Line"" being a personal favorite (also because of the subject) and ""Logan"" that I also really enjoyed, I was definitely looking forward to his newest project. Mangold was not part of the writing team here this time, but it was nonetheless three people, namely the Butterworth Brothers and Jason Keller. But while none of them are rookies amymore, the only really experienced one here is the older Butterworth. Still looking at the film's massive running time of 2.5 hours, slightly over even, it is not too surprising that there are three writers credited. Must have been a really long script. Now as for the cast, it is basically two names only: Oscar winners Christian Bale and Matt Damon. There are experienced supporting actors in here too and you will maybe recognize their faces such as Bernthal, McKinnon or Letts (plus surprisingly familiar faces from NCIS and Prettly Little Liars in minor roles), but nobody comes remotely close to the star potential of the two in the lead. But they are both Team Ford here and not one of them Ferrari as you could have guessed from the title. Now this is major car racing movie, perhaps the biggest since Rush from over half a decade ago and if you liked that one, then probably you will like this one here as well. However, we are not inside Formula One this time, but instead the focus is on a competitive racing occasion mostly that is probably more famous in the United States and less famous here in Germany. I am talking about Le Mans or (if you want the long version) the 24 Hours of Le Mans, even if there are references to other races too like the one Bale's character needs to win in order to be allowed into Le Mans by Mr. Ford.So the movie is packed with racing references. However, there are other subjects too like family life, company policies and also the fact that riding sports cars will always be linked very closely to danger, maybe life-threatening danger even. Well certainly the latter. Even today, it is a dangerous sport and back then, it was even more the case. There is that memorable reference on several occasions that as long as you are getting out of the car you are fine. Otherwise... But lets not include further spoilers. Let me just say that the film of course stayed close to reality, so they had to include these developments at the end and certain other parts as well, even if a lot in here was fictitious and added for drama purposes. Which is okay. I knew I was not watching a documentary. For example, while Leo Beebe is not fictitious, but also based on a real person, I genuinely wonder how much about him in here was actually exactly like they showed it. If I was from his family, I probably would not be too happy about the way they depicted things. Aside from that, I thought it was slightly shallow and not too inspired how they depicted him as the antagonist, also with his sucking-up to Mr. Ford for example. The idea behind how he manages to ""steal"" Bale's character his glory was good though and nice not to have a really happy ending. Now let me also add a few words on the two central characters. As for acting and depth, it is really all about Bale, much more than about Damon. We do not even find out about Damon's family backgrounds and really the only thing we do find out about his background is very early on that he was a successful driver as well, but had to end his career because of health concerns and went into engineering then. And all his baitier scenes are basically also empowered by other characters like the carte blanche moment. It's not a too well-written character and I don't think Damon will get a lot of awards recognition here. If any at all. As for Bale, he may get more because he definitely has the better material and there is no denying he is also the more gifted actor. However, he is as always walking the fine line between really going all in and creating something great and going over-the-top and maybe for his character here he tried to make him too special. But maybe it was just my perception. Or the writing. For example when they are telling the guy about how it is not against the rules to change the brakes, it was a bit painful to watch how Bale was acting in that scene. But he has good moments too no denying and I don't think many actors would have played the part better. Still I did not find him (or Damon's character) as likable as they wanted me to. So all in all, I enjoyed the watch here. The film does not get close to Mangold's (what I mentioned early on), Bale's or Damon's best, but this is just because their best is so amazing and not because this one here would be bad or anything. On the contrary. It is fairly decent and felt shorter than 150 minutes. I give this film a thumbs-up, albeit not a 100% enthusiastic one. Go watch if you like the subject or either of the two lead actors or both would be even better. I am writing this as somebody who does not care too much about racing anymore and never cared about Le Mans, so you definitely don't have to in order to appreciate this film. It has from beginning to end some really nice attention to detail (just wanna mention one scene near the end when Mr. Ferrari briefly pays his respect to Bale's character and there are many other scenes, also slight fun moments like the stopwatch etc.) that makes it certainly worth checking out. Go for it."
". . . in graphically documenting another sad chapter in the saga of America's Most Fiendish Family. Edsel's whelp (Hank #2) stands in as FORD V FERRARI's most hiss-worthy villain, as he viciously drives beloved World Racing Champ ""Ken"" to a premature, fiery death in a faulty Ford car. Perhaps it's a wise decision by the filmmakers to forego a prologue showing Hank #1's gun thugs patrolling the world's first auto assembly lines, with orders to shoot any workers who dare talk to each other. Maybe it would be beside the point to depict members of this Corrupt Corporate Fat Cat Family chilling with Der Fuhrer, and providing technical support for the latter's infamous Blitzkrieg. Possibly it would be too much of a tangent to incorporate references to Edsel's Revenge, when Hank One's favorite son was NOT given a starting spot by the Detroit Lions, prompting this petty grudge-bearing conniving clan to BUY the team with the intention of making it the focus of national derision forever. However, what FORD V FERRARI actually DOES put up on the screen should be enough to convince anyone (beyond the demonically-possessed ditto-head Pachyderm core supporters) NEVER to get behind the wheel of a fraudulent Ford!"
"Trust the Americans to not acknowledge the major contribution made by the British.
The film leaves you with the impression that the car was entirely American designed and built.
The Mk I, Mk II, and Mk III variants of the Ford GT40 were designed and built in England based upon the British Lola Mk6."
Whilst very different along with the joker this is by far my joint favourite film of the year the first racing film I can remember seeing in a long time I felt like I was living and breathing the car scenes as the driver with the emotional oomph added by a simply sublime Damon and Bale made this flawless on every level. A real must watch!
"Inspiring, fantastically acted, and wonderfully approached, Ford v Ferrari gives the true life story the fuel it needs to truly become the one of a kind racing tale it could be. Christian Bale is obviously the largest standout of the films high end cast, giving another brilliant performance. Matt Damon is maybe only second best in the film, but he does a great job asd well, and provides for a perfect match for Bale's take on the character and its personality. The film is wonderfully shot, with breathtaking views, and fueled with an often pulse of excitement that truly grabs your attention the way a movie should. The film does seem to start slow, but as with cars, as it goes on longer it begins to pick up speed, making for an exciting ride. The soundtrack is also a particular standout, with an original score that fits its material better than most films this year, and a sound in general that isn't too loud or obnoxious for a racing flick. In the end, Ford v Ferrari is not perfect, but it is a car film like no other and certainly earns a chance in this years Oscar race, as if it didn't have one already.
My Rating: 9.5/10"
"Ford v Ferrari was a really special experience for me. I am not a person who is related to the cars, but this movie made me feel like a pilot. My adrenaline went crazy while I was watching the race scenes ( or should I say I was experiencing them ). Ford v Ferrari was like a virtual reality racing game. Cinematography, sound efects, visual efects and soundtracks made the experience so realistic. Christian Bale and Matt Damon are both GREAT actors and in this movie their performances are Oscar-nomination worthy ( especially Christian Bale ). In a nutshell, It's been an exciting and enjoyable 152 minutes. The directors and the actors did a great job and adapted this rivalry to the big screen. When I got out of the theatre, I was thinking about how much the audience need this kind of movies."
I am not a fan of Motorsports or a rev head. However this movie was awesome. I was reluctant to see this but was blown away by the performances and the story.
"Amazing acting, direction, action sequences and incredible story. Showcases human emotions in cinema after many many years. Very good sound effects."
Fun movie with two great leading men. Both are grappling with a tough industry while maintaining their own vision. Best parts in my opinion are the racing bits which Bale's character Ken Miles absolutely kills. Damon & Bale's portrayal of the real life friendship of these two mavericks is remarkable. I don't think it's perfect but it is an enjoyable movie. Good job James Mangold and team.
Overall great movie with strong character development and a complex yet easy to follow storyline. Highly recommend.
"Ford v Ferrari (titled Le Mans '66 in the UK and other territories) is a biographical American drama film directed by James Mangold and written by Jez Butterworth, John-Henry Butterworth, and Jason Keller. It stars Matt Damon and Christian Bale, with Caitriona Balfe, Jon Bernthal, Tracy Letts, Josh Lucas, Noah Jupe, Remus Girone and Ray McKinnon appearing in supporting roles.In 1963, Enzo Ferrari was approached by the Ford Motor Company about a possible purchase. Conversations were unilaterally interrupted by Ferrari when Enzo realized that the deal included the purchase of Ferrari's racing program, a program that won the Le Mans 24 Hours in 1958 and every year from 1960 to 1965. Le Mans is the most The world's oldest sports car endurance race, held annually since 1923. Troubled by being rejected, Henry Ford II drove his racing division to build a car to beat the Scuderia Ferrari.The film tells how automotive designer Carroll Shelby and race car driver Ken Miles lead a team of American Ford engineers and designers to build a race car that can beat the legendary Ferrari. Finally, they produce the Ford GT40 for a 1966 Le Mans 24 Hour showdown.Ford v Ferrari excels at evoking the pure thrill of racing - 'a body moving in space and time', as one character put it - and is compelling enough in those moments to argue that nothing beats the thrill of competition.Matt and Bale stand out in their performances by becoming a duo and I remembered the movie Fast and Furious from the characters of actor Vin and Paul. And so my movie grade is 8 out of 10."
"Christian Bale and Matt Damon are two of the most talented actors working today, so my level of anticipation was high for ""Ford v Ferrari."" I'm happy to say that the movie doesn't disappoint: it's an engrossing, emotional drama that held me on the edge of my seat throughout all of its 152 minutes. ""Ford v Ferrari"" takes an obscure true life story and turns it into a heart wrenching and thought provoking tale of friendship, creativity, ego, corporate politics, and human ingenuity. I knew little about the facts behind ""Ford v Ferrari"" before walking into the theater, but afterwards I couldn't get enough of reading about the real characters portrayed so well by Damon and Bale. In ""Ford v Ferrari"" these two are in top form: Damon's charisma and Bale's quirky genius spark amazing chemistry that carries the entire movie.This movie is masterfully directed by James Mangold: the cinematography is awe-inspiring and the racing sequences are among the best I've ever seen. As a filmmaking achievement, ""Ford v Ferrari"" is outstanding. I do have a couple of problems with the movie: certain elements of the plot were predictable, and a few scenes here and there weren't fully developed so it was somewhat difficult to understand what'd just happened. But these are only minor flaws with the script that are outweighed by great performances, beautiful cinematography, and terrific racing sequences that should set the standard for future racing movies. 8/10."
"Ford v Ferrari tells the story of the Ford Motor Company after being betrayed by Ferrari in an acquisition deal trying to design a car to compete in the 66' Le Mans race to beat Ferrari first and foremost. Henry Ford II (Letts) recruits Carol Shelby (Damon) and Ken Miles (Bale) to engineer and race a car respectively in order to finally become the first american manufactured car to win the race.As someone who was initially unfamiliar with the story of the 66' Le Mans race; what the build up to it entailed and what happened afterwards I was consistently glued to the screen. In my mind the stakes were high and anything could happen. And this story does not sugarcoat any part of the details. It is an underdog story in the sense that Ford, a much smaller underdog car company that doesn't specialize in speed is going up against a juggernaut like Ferrari, a luxury car built to be expensive and flashy is truly a race. It also shows that there is much more to racing that just speed and design, the driver plays a crucial role. A well-established relationship between the car and driver is frugal because in this race they would have to spend upwards of 24 hours together, they have to know each other and what their limits are, otherwise there will be catastrophic consequences.The acting performances are all fantastic, even if no one really has an Oscar worthy scene. Christian Bale does not quite reach his full potential but is still very transformative as a hot shot arrogant but talented driver. Matt Damon is also pretty good despite his accent not being that convincing. However the standout performance is Tracy Letts as Henry Ford II, who is determined to beat Ferrari at any costs, including getting into his very own car and trusting his very arrogant driver. His performance inside his own race car was both gripping and hilariously performed. The racing scenes were also very stellar, there is the typical drama that happens inside the pit, but seeing it transform from the pit to the track is really masterful build up, and what made the race scenes so engaging, as well as the directing by Mangold. If a race scene is able to craft so much motion sickness and tension by just showing a shot-reverse shot sequence, then this is a job done by a real racing enthusiast or a great director.There were however a couple of scenes that didn't really work. For example, a couple of character drama scenes. I understand we have to show the life of Ken Miles, his wife and son who are still supportive of his dream. However this really isn't a character drama movie, it is a real life dramatization of events. There are scenes that are kind of meaningless is the larger retelling of the narrative. They might have happened in real life, but there was no real payoff to any of them. For example, Shelby is shown to have a bad heart and would never race again. This is set up and doesn't pay off at all. Many scenes might be telling a real life story, but don't really affect the narrative of Ford v Ferrari. A good fifteen minutes could have been trimmed and the movie would have stayed the same.Ford v Ferrari tells an engaging story for car enthusiasts, it has enough racing to satisfy anyone who has a thirst for high speed action, who may also love stunt driving not extremely dumbed down. It can also spark an interest for people who aren't automotively challenged. It is not necessarily a masterpiece or even a Best Picture contender, but it a solid two and a half our watch. It is fast, it funny and it is thrilling most of the way."
"""Ford v Ferrari"" is a well done and in depth long drawn out biography that does give good focus to the auto industry and how power and greed intersect with it. As it tells the true story of the legendary race in which Ford challenged Ferrari and would come out on top as an automotive leader.The scenes are tense and heart pounding often gripping with tension as the gear shifts on the lane, yet things also shift in life for industry and the characters involved. As showcased are the power struggles and corporate problems of industry like greed and doubt however when the Ford GT is developed it breaks the company free to win around the curb of the tracks!Most compelling and interesting is seeing the friendship form between car designer Carroll Shelby(Matt Damon) and hotshot race driver Ken Miles(Christian Bale) as despite the drama and thrill of the 24 hours of Le Mans in 1966 a bond and lasting and listening friendship is formed between the polar opposites! Overall good touching film of showing how fast speed won over many with love and friendship the film was really paced well and mixed with fun and drama for a near perfect finish lap!"
This movie is a must watch for car lovers! Infact everyone.
"Slightly Understated because of the direction and the pace but once the characters are introduced, the lineage of plot is perfectly executed not only providing breathing space to the latters but also to the collision of Captitalist Fordism and the thrill of competition, simultaneously. A perfect nail-bite in a long time.
Watch out for Jason Bourne and The Dark Knight soldiating chaos on the screen."
"The best racing sport drama I've ever seen after 'Rush'. Car Maniac's will love this film. I know one or two about regular cars and I've no idea about racing cars but from zero to end, the film was exhilarating and i got to know how 24 hours le mans event goes. Christian Bale and Matt Damon's friendship in movie was funny yet beautiful! Even one liner jokes worked out very well. I specifically want to appreciate Sound Design crew and Director for this movie, boy what a feel they've given to this film! Watch it even if you don't know anything about racing cars, it's explained very detailed in the film."
"Brilliant story, screenplay, direction & acting !! And above all, there's Christian Bale. He single handedly knocks this movie out the park with his portrayal of Ken Miles. Outstanding entertainment for racing & non-racing fans.."
"Fresh off directing Logan and making waves with Walk the Line, James Mangold has created a car racing epic that is much better than Rush."
"I'm not a big fan of cars and racing, but still there was not a single moment in the movie that bored me. It was an absolute terrific cinematic experience, all thanks to Bale and Matt Damon. Christian Bale was the highlight of the movie, absolute monster of an actor."
"It's been long time since I enjoyed a movie like I enjoyed watching this movie,"
From start to end the movie was really good. Christiane bale and Matt Damon nailed with their stunning screen performance. Last 30 mins racing screen were brilliant. Must watch movie if u r a fan racing.
"It was worth 2 and half hours of my time, excellent move! Bale and Damon did awesome job."
"Big, well crafted, exciting, meaningful... Every element in the film works beautifully, sound editing, cinematography, acting, costume, etc. Makes for such a fun an engaging film and it also holds truth and insight into the human condition and doesn't treat you like a child. A grown up, direct and well told story, made me nostalgic even for the old-Hollywood classics when directors where humble and made sure to stay out of the way in service of the story. I'll have this one on bluray for sure."
"I was a bit skeptical about seeing the movie in the theatre but i booked the ticket and went for it. Good thing i did. I feel this is a movie that has to be experienced in the theatre. The racing scenes are AMAZING. The story is amazing. The acting is simply brilliant. If you are a racing fan, I expect you will enjoy this more than anyone and it is a must see. But whoever wants to cry, smile and feel adrenaline all packed into a movie, definitely go watch this!"
"Indeed a watch worth the wait. Nail-biting drama and an out-and-out edge-of-the-seat experience one could possibly want in a Christian Bale and Matt Damon starrer. And the sound effects!!!! Gosh!!! Truly exhilarating and fascinating work of art displayed by the sound design team. Perhaps watching it in IMAX just added to the experience tenfold. Bale was as stupendous as could be; possibly one of the best we've seen him in in quiet a while. Damon was no less astounding in his own right.
It won't be wrong to say that one of its greatest technical achievements lies in the fact that you don't necessarily have to be a ""car-guy"" to be able to commend this marvel. Another commendable fact was that despite being based on a true story, it had us giving a slight feeling of unpredictability at points, which was, in fact, a sight to behold. Also, in spite of being a tad bit long, it never even seemed to lose grip of the plot.The monstrous sound of the roaring engines could be felt throughout the entirety of the theatre, so even if a ""non-car-guy"" feels bored, these blaring sounds won't let him sleep. The final act was a bit of a let-down which was not what I expected to be the outcome.
All-in-all a feature rife with intensity, emotions, breakdowns (technical and emotional) and an over-the-top sound design which suffices for an individual to enable him to say that he is a member of such a cinephilic community that prides itself on being able to witness such level of filmmaking. Long live cinema!!!"
"Never a dull moment.
Christian Bale steals the show
as Ken Miles! Matt Damon was ok as Carroll Shelby.
Excellent!"
"I'll come right out and say that cars are one of the least interesting things in the world to me (perhaps only behind The Royal Family, fashion, and reality TV). If a car has four wheels, starts, and can maintain the speed limit: I'm happy. So it's unlikely I would have gone out of my way to see a movie so heavily focused on making and racing cars had it not been for the cast, the solid track record of director James Mangold, and the positive reviews.On the topic of those reviews- I'm not as enamoured with the movie as many seem to be, but I find this movie relatively easy to recommend to anyone who's willing to give this movie 2.5 hours of their life. This running length is mostly justified- it's a fairly large story but I feel it could've ideally been 20-30 minutes shorter, and for all the hubbub The Irishman has been stirring lately because of its epic length... I feel like that one justified its running time more.So the length and the subject matter weren't ideal for me, but highlights did include Bale's performance (wasn't he hugely overweight less than a year ago for Vice? This guy's commitment to the physicality of the roles he plays is INSANE), the racing scenes (they're tense as all hell, especially if you're like me and don't know the actual history of the events depicted), and the sound design. This movie has a really good chance of sweeping the technical awards at this year's Oscars, the same way movies like Gravity and Mad Max: Fury Road have done recently.Give it a watch I'd say, even if you're not a car nut. If you have a great home theatre and sound setup it's not a must watch at the cinema, but if not, it's a good one to see on the big screen."
"The stage curtains open ...""Ford v Ferrari"" is exactly the movie it is billed to be. Movie magic that is a blast from the past with excellent performances by the entire cast. When I first saw the trailer for this film, I knew I had to see it. Sometimes, when you watch a preview, you can tell that you've just seen all the best parts of the movie. Not so with this one. It delivers.The biopic starts with Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) receiving the bad news that he can no longer race since it would put too much strain on his heart and steer him to an early grave. So, he pairs up with race car driver, Ken Miles (Christian Bale) and together they form a friendship while remaining on the racing circuit and designing cars. When Ford Motors sales begin to plummet, Henry Ford II turns to Lee Iacocca for advice. Iacocca recommends that they purchase the now bankrupt Ferarri company. This plan is turned down by Enzo Ferarri who agrees to sell to Fiat instead. Enter Shelby and Miles as they team up with Ford to design a car that will put Ford back on the map by winning the famed Le Manz, a 24-hour endurance race.I absolutely love this movie. It really is why we go to the theaters. The production values were second to none, the cinematography engaging, the racing stunts eye popping, the acting believable and the story involving. The only reason it doesn't get a full 10 stars from me is because it does run a little long. But, even so, you are so invested into the film, it goes by at a very good pace.I highly recommend ""Ford v Ferarri"". I have plans to go see it at least one more time before it leaves the big screen. We're heading into December now, but it is easily one of my favorite films of the year. If you love a good story with enough action to keep you smiling, this is a great one for you. 9 stars out of 10."
Great movie with a great cast! Shows the origin of the Ford GT40 and the initial struggles Ford and Carol Shelby had to overcome in order to contest Ferrari's dominance of the racing world in the 1960s. Damon and Bale play a great duo in this movie which really makes the movie comical and dramatic throughout. Definitely recommend this movie!
"Is not the best sports biographi movie, but this one definitely be on top list of all time. christian bale and matt damon shows us what a perfect Chemistry can impact to a movie. and bale? bale doing an incredible act performance.for you who are a motorhead this movie can speak to you in a way you'll never expect. i mean i come to watch a good movie, and shock by how good they tell ""how does it feel to drive"" damn. every scene where that exhaust were roar can give you a goosebumps.And yeah, don't worry ken, the world knows you're the true triple Crown winner"
"Even with the mediocre Christian Bale (why didn't they cast someone with talent?), this is a very exciting and great film. Matt Damon is fantastic-but he's always fantastic. Why Damon hasn't received an Oscar for his acting talent is a mystery.
If you enjoy motor racing, you'll love this film."
I really like the movie .. its a movie which will stay in my memory for long time
Ford vs Ferrari was the best movie for racing to go and see if you like fast cars
"In my opinion Ford v Ferrari is a masterpiece, it is the first movie to ever make me cry and it is my new favorite movie."
"Its entertaining. Cliche at times but the movie moves rather fluidly. Forget about the inaccuracies thats what books are for, this a hollywood film so expect hollywood stuff. The sound editing is killer and the cinematography is great also."
"After a slightly glacial exposition into the history of the stories behind motor companies Ford and Ferrari, the film goes into full on over-drive with one of the most pulsating second halves in a film you're sure to see all year. The film is a technical marvel with top-notch editing, sound design and direction - almost a lock to get nominations (and probably wins) in those categories and then some. Bale and Damon are simply stupendous, showing a real sensitivity in the more dramatic moments while showcasing their charisma and comedic chops in performances that rank among the year's best. F v. F is an exhilarating, exciting and emotional ride to be in the driver's seat for and undoubtedly one of this year's best."
"I was around cars as a child because of my dad and grandfather. I never took an interest in them though. I feel like this is the type of movie that could inspire an entire new generation of youngsters that want to race for a living.Christian Bale is excellent! Matt Damon is excellent! The sound design and editing sticks out to me on this movie and it's almost sure to win Oscars because of that. The cinematography does a great job of immersing you in the races and making your heart race! It'll be interesting to see what other films step up to compete in cinematography. If none show up, this will likely take that category too(Although I hope Parasite takes it).The script is good but I did find myself a little bored during parts of the character development scenes. Christian Bale is always Christian Bale but I do think Matt Damon was the stronger character here. I love Bale's movies and I'll always see them but Christian Bale reminded me of how he is for his role in The Fighter so in Oscar respects it's kind of an already been there done that kind of thing.This movie brings up competition for me. While it seemed to be heavy back then, I'm curious how much of a cut-throat competition it is nowadays.While this story favors America, I do think when it comes to industrial things or car-related things... American ingenuity is going to win out every time when it matters."
"Great action scenes, mixed with drama story! Amazing acting of Christian Bale! When the cars driving you want to drive as well it keeps you inside movie all time long!"
"It's hard for me to give movies a 10 out of 10, but this movie has to be the best movie of 2019. From the second this movie starts youll be sucked into the story and youll feel every emotion from the actors. Just amazing!"
Is there anything Christian Bale cannot do? He once again delivers an Oscar worthy performance. Matt Damon is also in superb form. The racing sequences have been picturized perfectly and the movie will keep you invested in the characters long after it is over. Must watch.
"Story is great! Very emotionally intense! Matt Damon did a great job balancing acting and getting immersed in the character. While Christian Bale was, for me, too intense at many points I got a little bit uncomfortable."
"Bale and Damon perfectly helm their roles and James Mongold brilliantly brings the tension and excitement of racing to the big screen.
Whether you are a car enthusiast or not this film is a must see this year."
"71' Le mans Steve McQueen vs James garner 66' Grand Prix which one is better?94' the shawshank redemption think of any scene where it could of been better ?
not easyford vs ferrair who is it for... the gearhead or his or HER girlfriend
well you will find some nice moments here but health and safety has crippled the classic car film of yesteryear much like the crippled and maimed stuntmen that made them possible.but what bothers me most is the spotlight on the drama watching this film you cant escape the fact the bad guys win, the crooked bankers don't go to jail and the good guys die, perhaps their real reward.this film is sprinkled with pleasant moments ""shelby flying comes to mind"" but i am on this unwanted emotional roller coaster with no payoff.
Not the car film we all hoped for, with a re-edit it could be rescued a little, but this is no cult classic.ford vs ferrari could of been a passable comedy but where it sits now is no mans land, barely re-watchale.but please keep trying to find that automotive masterpiece.
leMans is too much for the gear head much like 71' two-lane blacktop they are phenomenal but finding the perfect car film, now that Ain't easy.For a film about building a racing car and winning leMans, why is the spotlight on unnecessary filler.
throw in some motorbikes and let the every man daydream for a couple hours then BACK TO WORK.your reward watch
No mans land (1987) Charley Sheen
Two-lane blacktop (1971) James Taylor yeah the singer
Dirty Mary Crazy Larry (1974) Peter Fonda R.I.P
White Lightning (1973) Burt Reynolds the goat
The Gumball Rally (1976) Raul Julia
Le Mans (1971) Steve McQueen the film you should watch instead of this.I said, that's life (that's life) and as funny as it may seem
Some people get their kicks
Stompin' on a dream
But I don't let it, let it get me down
'Cause this fine old world it keeps spinnin' around."
It was ok. Bale and Damon do well in their individual roles. Felt like a box ticking exercise a little they didn't get too involved with the engineering which is a shame. Also the driving feels a bit as hoc to say there's a 24 hour race it doesn't feel like you see the impact it has on the drivers . Don't know if it was my cineworld that let the soundtrack down but didn't feel the sound bouncing around me like I expected .
"This is a pleasantly surprising film. Partly because of the narrative - I was expecting a pro-Ford take on the celebrated rivalry, after having seen the Amazon documentary (I think it's called the 24 hour race or something). I was proved wrong.By choosing to focus on the two primary characters (superbly portrayed by Matt Damon and Christian Bale), James Mangold's gamble pays off handsomely in this tale of man and machine against all odds. Ford vs Ferrari is as much as Miles-Shelby's dogged perseverance against stumbling blocks from their own backers as it is against their iconic European counterparts. Their partnership is chalk and cheese - the diplomatic Shelby complementing the ""difficult"" Miles but it works remarkably well. There is a good reason the American calls the Brit ""Bulldog"" as Miles' tenacious pursuit of the perfect lap motivates people around him to go further. The action and humor prove an effective blend in driving the narrative forward. The cinematography, score and sound design are expertly done, capturing the intimacy of characters' personal lives as well as the frenzied restlessness of race days.In terms of performances, Bale and Damon have a terrific chemistry and Mangold exploits it shrewdly. While Bale tends to overact in some scenes (his facial expressions border on the ridiculous sometimes), he nails the eccentricities of a war veteran-turned-race-driver character to perfection. Unlike others, I did not find his accent surprising, but his preparation and dedication to his craft continue to leave a lasting impression. That said, this film completely belongs to Damon. He has the best scenes, the best lines and the meatiest character. His Texan drawl may not be pitch-perfect, but his control and restraint form the essence to the story as well as a ideal icy foil to Bale's hot-headed, fiery persona. The supporting cast is quite decent, though I was disappointed to not see the John Bernthal get more screen time.Ford v Ferrari wins not because of the titular rivalry, but inspite of it. A very enjoyable and entertaining racing film."
"Amazing marriage of human drama, action, and history. I even enjoyed watching actors that I don't like. All I can say is that I've never seen 2.4 hours pass so quickly. Not one moment of boredom or a single wasted frame. Congratulations on an extremely successful effort."
"Starting with the story which is crisp and thrilling, Christian Bale what an artist he is, always setting up the standards of his movie high and his Co actor Matt Damon always came up with the expectations very well. Only one bad thing about the movie that it was too long and stretchy at one point so that's why I reduced half rating. It's a must watch movie 🎥"
"There comes a moment in one's (professional) life when one's own passion, drive, skill, and one's immediate team and opportunity - all line-up. Few of us are able to embrace that chance to become the best versions of ourselves and set benchmarks for generations to follow. This movie celebrates that spirit of pursuit of perfection at one's craft both individually and as a team.Caroll Shelby & Phil Remington built and Ken Miles raced the Ford Shelby GT 40 which defeated the most brilliantly engineered cars at the time - The Ferrari in the most demanding and enduring race in the world - 24 hours of LeMans in 1966 and it went on to win for 4 consecutive years. And to date, it remains the only American car to do so.Yes, the movie has all the adrenaline pumping, engine revving, nail-biting action that we expect from a race car movie. But it goes much beyond that by bringing out the amazing comradery and personal journeys of Caroll Shelby and Ken Miles. It shows how a small team of committed and talented people who set themselves an impossible target can actually make God (Ferrari) bleed by sheer will power, raw talent, and good old hard work. It also beautifully shows how family believes in you when others give up.Christian Bale and Matt Damon are impeccable.Visuals are awesome, all real cars, real drivers, shot from the perspective of the driver - Behind the wheel and on the track. Above all, the perfect harmony of man and machine with endurance is on display here."
"In my books, this is one of the best motor racing stories told and I think one of the top 3 movies I have watched in 2019. Even as a person not into Le Mans type racing, the storytelling of the two main characters and how fast cars and racing are presented will envelope you into this obsessive world even if you are not a motorsports fan.With romance, family bond, brotherhood, conflict, success and tragedy in the right amounts coupled with a great script, cast and film-making, this is an extremely potent movie that will make you leave the cinema with multiple spectrum of feelings all at the same time. The umami of great story telling."
"I was looking forward to a new movie about racing cars and especially one about doing Le Mans because there's a lot I'd like to know about that race in particular. This excellent movie is less about the ins and outs of particular races than about two of the men behind one actual attempt to give America a presence in the toughest race of all. It's a wonderfully American story though one of the men is an expatriate Brit, Ken Miles, played by Christian Bale like he was born to play this role. The part is the true center of the film despite Matt Damon's strong performance and that of numerous supporting players. I will truly be surprised if this movie doesn't sweep all the award shows."
"I watched the movie after knowing that James Mangold had directed it. It is one of those movies where after watching it you don't really feel that it was an 2.5 hr movie.It is difficult to compare it with ""Rush"" as the premise is different. Even though the title suggests "" Ford v Ferrari "" but at the core it is really more about Shelby --Miles v Ford Executives.
The movie is able to capture the relation b/n Miles and Shelby as they build a car to race @ Le Mans . As you get to know what Le Mans is you realize the pace of the movie and at the end why is it that you really liked it.The movie is set with mild to Intense racing scenes which can be said as one of the trait of the movie as it doesn't let you on the edge of the seat but rather lets you enjoy sitting back. As to acting with Christian Bale, Matt Damon, Jon Bernthal and other brilliant supporting cast it is what you expect. Even though the screen time is less between Bale and Balfe (Wife ) you will love it.
At the end you will feel satisfied when you come out of the Hall and wish no more with the end and lingering feeling which will stay with you for some time."
"My Review - Ford V Ferrari
Mr rating. 8.5 /10I don't have the slightest interest in car racing or cars but this story and its characters held my interest for 152 minutes and that in my opinion is the test of good directing by James Mangold ( Walk the Line ,Wolverine Logan) and a great ensemble cast of actors.Ford V Ferrari is based on a true story like nearly every movie these days and centres around the two main characters Matt Damon as Carroll Shelby and Christian Bale as racing car driver Ken MilesThe bones of the story you can view in the trailer but the flesh and blood is in the great script by Jason Keller and brothers Jez and John-Henry Butterworth who were named recipients of the Writers Guild of America West's 2011 Paul Selvin Award for their screenplay for the film Fair Game (2010), directed by Doug Liman and starring Naomi Watts and Sean Penn.The story is basically described in IMBD as American car designer Carroll Shelby and driver Ken Miles battle corporate interference, the laws of physics and their own personal demons to build a revolutionary race car for Ford and challenge Ferrari at the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1966.For me it was the characters that got me in not the great action car racing scenes
Matt Damon as usual gives a great performance but it's Christian Bale that steals the film he's a great dad and husband and very funny at times but doesn't suffer fools graciously and has attitude plus to anyone who tries to come between him and his passion of racing. I wouldn't be at all surprised if Christian Bale is nominated for an Oscar next year for this role of course he'll lose it to Joaquin Phoenix for Joker.Matt Damon is his friend and champion when the self interested Ford Corporate bosses try to edge Ken Miles out as their driver as in their eyes he's not a ""Ford Man.""
Henry Ford 11 played so well by Tracy Letts is a pig and runs his Ford Empire with fear that includes one scene in which he shuts of the machines and threatens his workers . Josh Lucas as Leo Beebe Fords Director of Special vehicles and the executive nemesis of Carroll Shelby and Ken Miles is also great in this perfectly balance ensemble cast of actors .Ken Miles wife Mollie played by Catriona Balfe gets a special mention as does Noah Jupe as Miles son Peter they are both so convincing and it reinforces my empathy with families of racing car drivers and all daredevil pursuits that they can never be sure if their loved one will come home after a race.I thoroughly recommend seeing Ford V Ferrari it's one of the best movies of the year."
"Ford is failing as a company and in a last ditch effort to drive sales back up, they decide to expand their racing division. Rather than spending years and untold millions perfecting their own racecars, they decide to buy out Ferrari, but all they get are manipulations and insults, starting the infamous rivalry between Enzo Ferrari and Henry Ford II. In retaliation, Ford enlist the help of Carroll Shelby to build them a car that can blow Ferrari's out of the water. And so was born the GT40. But a racecar is only half of it, they need a driver too, and Shelby's choice in Ken Miles is too hard a sell for the Ford executives.So which suits better, Ford v Ferrari or Le Mans '66? Honestly there isn't much of a movie without either. The Ford/Ferrari rivalry is what drives the first half of the movie, while preparation for Le Mans is what drives the second half. Throughout it's more of a Ken Miles biopic. I guess ""Ken Miles: The True Story"" wouldn't have sold many tickets though. And while Carroll Shelby does appear a lot, he's not explored as a character anywhere near as deeply as Ken Miles is. We don't learn anything about his home life, we don't get to see him wrestle with his demons, and the film's coda almost entirely revolves around Miles' affect on everyone around him.Ken Miles is the star of the movie, there's no doubt about that, and Christian Bale is unsurprisingly great in the role, slipping in like a chameleon, like he does with every character he plays. He's a down-on-his-luck auto-mechanic who can't even pay the bills, and despite his good connections in Shelby and his unmatched skill as a racing driver, his quick temper and difficulty to work with keeps him rooted in the amateur circuit. That is, of course, until Shelby gets the offer from Ford to give them the Le Mans win. It takes one failed year at the race for Shelby to convince the higher-ups at Ford that they need an expert driver who has hands-on experience with the GT40 in building and testing to really get them the win.Acting is fairly top-notch across the board, and it's hard to say Bale stole the show when almost everyone else keeps up so well. Matt Damon offers no surprises as Shelby, with his strongest scenes at the very end. Jon Bernthal gets a little shafted in the second half as Lee Iacocca, but he gets plenty of time to shine before then, particularly in the negotiations with Ferrari. Josh Lucas is deliciously punchable as Leo Beebe, the Ford suit put in charge of the racing division, who is portrayed here as having no clue about racing, is constantly against Ken Miles' involvement, and even costs him the win at the end in the name of a photo opportunity. Caitriona Balfe is great as Miles' wife, who takes no crap from her husband, and supports him wherever she can. Tracy Letts is also pretty good as the no-nonsense, stoic Henry Ford II, with his stand-out scene being in a GT40 prototype crying his eyes out. At first you think it's due to pure fear of the speeds he's experienced, but then you realise they're happy tears having restored faith in his racing project, and then they evolve again into sadness and regret that his father, Henry Ford senior, was no longer alive to experience such a pinnacle achievement in automotive machinery. It becomes a surprisingly emotive scene purely thanks to Letts' performance.Le Mans '66 also has merits in the technical department. It's like crack to a driving junkie, particularly anyone with even a passing interest in 60s sportscars or the racing scene. I've always had a passing interest in cars thanks to my mum and dad both being rally drivers in their younger years, so Le Mans '66 definitely struck a chord with me. The roar of the engines is palpable and infectious, and seeing all sorts of snazzy classic cars driving around was a delight. As I understand it a lot of the GT40s, Shelbys, and Ferraris, including 330 P3 and 275 GTB used in the movie were real, only employing CGI and dummies for crashes, giving the whole experience a feeling of authenticity.The only criticism I particularly have revolves around the film's coda, showing Ken Miles' death and the effect it had on some of the characters. It felt unnecessary and meant the film ended on a considerable downer. It would be like if Bohemian Rhapsody followed up the LiveAid performance with Freddie Mercury's death and the various members of Queen reacting to it. The ending of the Le Mans race was enough of a downer for Ken, having the victory stolen from him thanks to a technicality in a publicity stunt, and then the next scene they kill him off on a test track in front of his son. Sure, he died doing what he loved, but it felt like a bit too much of a one-two punch. Ending it just after the race as he graciously accepts second place would have sufficed. This is really more of a niggle and personal taste more than anything though. It might work for you.In all Le Mans '66 was an enjoyable cinema experience. It hit all the right notes for a casual car fan in myself, and I'm sure it'll hit them all for fanatics who lived through it like my parents. But for those without any interest in cars, there's still plenty here for you. The acting is fantastic, the story never lags, and the race sequences are thrilling from beginning to end. I give Le Mans '66 a solid 8/10."
"First of all. Both Bale and Damon did such an amazing job making this movie feel so honest. I was especially impressed with Bale's performance. He made this character so believable and relatable without even saying that much.
Although the trailer makes you think it's all about Ford and Ferrari, the movie is actually the story of Ken Miles. Wich was, in my opinion, much more interesting.
Also the racing scenes where stunning and very cool.
I have only one thing I didn't quite understand..What was Shelby shewing the whole movie long?"
"I don't know about you but I am snoringly bored of superhero films that have been crowding out the mainstream cinema lately. So it was a pleasure to see this film, which was a really solid Hollywood drama about a relatively novel subject. It's not a movie that will leave you thinking for days afterwards, but instead a perfect movie to see with a friend or date for a solid 2 1/2 hour watch that I can't imagine anyone not enjoying."
"By far the best racing movie in decades!! The racing scenes are incredible and the acting is award worthy. Being a dihard car guy, I believe I noticed a slight flaw in one scene, which is the only reason I didn't give it a 10 out of 10 rating. During an early race scene (1963?) it showed several Corvettes competing, however one of them had a 1967 stinger hood. Anyway, since I'm planning on going a second time, I'll keep an eye out for it and correct my review if I was wrong =)"
"""Sometimes words...they are just not useful. Tools, well they can fix and repair things.""Truly lived up to the billing and justified my choice of being the most awaited movie in the last quarter of 2019. This was totally an engineer's wet dream, but you don't really need to be a keen follower of motor sports to understand the movie. Rather, you will be compelled to research on it after you make the exit.Most people will be deterred from watching it, just by looking at the runtime, but trust me, it's totally worth it. Everyone is in such fine form that it makes the watch a really pleasant one. Matt Damon as the iconic Carroll Shelby hits it out of the park. The lady playing Ken Miles' wife was fantastic and that scene where she has a bout of hysteria in a speeding car was definitely my favourite.Go for this one. It's really a spectacle."
"How is the destiny of mankind interwoven with the machines we create? Quite powerfully in myriad ways I think we'd all agree. That intersection of man and machine becomes singularly pure in the realm of automobile racing.One of the great true stories is that of Ferrari's snubbing of Henry Ford II's attempt to buy into racing via purchasing Enzo Ferrari's company. Taking the insult personal Henry Ford became a man obsessed with winning LeMans and de-throning Ferrari.Ford winning LeMans, It's a mission no one at the time thought was possible and it rested upon much more than money, engineering, and sheet metal. Two men played pivotal roles not only having an impossible goal to chase, but fighting a corporate culture with zero understanding of how to get out of the way and let them do it.These two men persevered under the corporate interference which often hurt as much as bank-rolled their mission. That two-man juggernaut core was Carol Shelby and Ken Miles. Two very different personalities who often clashed yet had a mutual respect for one another much like brothers of different mothers. While the quest to beat Ferrari and win LeMans provides the back drop for the saga, it is the two men, their relationship, and their success which defines the achievement. Ford v Ferrari as a racing movie is great, but it's these two characters that give it the blood of humanity. Matt Damon as Carol Shelby and Christian Bale as Ken Miles are utterly fantastic in bringing these two to life on screen. Especially Bale as Miles, he literally assumes what you'd imagine the real man was like in a kind of ""beyond acting"" if you will. Engrossing.Speaking of engrossing. The cinematography and realism of racing reaches new levels here. In both sight and sound. Framing of shots, colors that jump, and a stealthy soundtrack that provides great atmosphere while never overtaking shows tremendous craft in filmmaking. The film pulls one in as if there was a personal stake involved. That, again, is the human factor. One which surmounts great odds while taking life chances in order to conquer and succeed. I find little fault with this film and think it will be enjoyed by masses who have little or no interest in racing. Quite simply one enjoyable film whose long length is neither tedious or superfluous. I highly recommend seeing Ford v Ferrari. The fact it adheres closely to the true events make it even more remarkable."
"I knew something great was going to come out from the pairing of Christian Bale and Matt Damon in Ford V Ferrarri and I was not disappointed at all. It had what I expected: interesting characters, great acting, thrilling car races. What I did not expect was corporate culture, which had Jon Bernthal play Lee Iaccocca. This added element made the movie even more interesting because you know the protagonists are already fighting an impossible task of beating Ferrarri while having to battle corporate interference. It is the battle between doers and the suits. Bale is one of the rare actors who transforms in every role he is and you immediately forget he was once Batman driving an insane Batmobile. The same goes for Damon and Bernthal. You completely forget Damon used to be Jason Bourne and Bernthal the Punisher. The funniest part is Bale's brawl with Damon as shown in the trailer. I like how Ferrarri is not vilified in the movie, since I am a Ferrarri fan. But on the other hand I truly root for Bale's Ken Miles and Damon's Carroll Shelby to win. This is a movie about two guys struggling to do the impossible while battling outside interference from non experts. This situation is very relatable. The race scenes are exhilarating. The soundtrack blends with the action resulting in a pulsepounding thrill ride. I am even more amazed that this is a true story, but am sure that without the capable directing by James Mangold, and the excellent performances brought by Christian Bale and Matt Damon, this movie would definitely fail."
"Thrilling at times and tender in moments. Incredible racing scenes and with great visuals and audio. I'm not a big fan of Matt Damon and he would not have been my first choice for Shelby, but after viewing the film I cannot say that he wasn't the right choice. The acting was spot on and the story was well told. Likely my favorite racing movie of all time. Entertaining and moving"
"I went to see this film thinking that having Matt Damon and Christian Bale is sure not to disappoint - and I am glad to say I was right. I also wanted to see the legendary story of Ford vs Ferrari, as it happened, on the big screen and got more than I hoped for.
The drama, characters, excellent music, and everything else that makes for a great film can be found here. I loved boh the performances of ALL actors as well as the life-like race cars and how they are driven and how they behave in different situations. If you are not a racing fan, there will be plenty to enjoy, but knowing a thing or two about cars, gearboxes and RPMs helps.
The only thing that I didn't care for were few minor historically innacurrate details, which were added for entertainment value, I imagine. One, here or there, I could live with, but when they are piled up, and don't help the story, they should be left out.
Other than those minor complaints, which is why I give it 9 instead of 10 stars, the film is as close to perfect as one can get."
"Very good movie, not only for petrol heads.
Well shot and played, good sound and overall very good put together. Family friendly."
"Overall, it's an entertaining story for those who know little of the actual timeline of events but the full story would have taken a six hour movie to be accurate. So they've taken a decade-plus series of events and compressed them into a one year tale that's filled with excitement and drama.For 60's racing fans, and antique car buffs in general, there is plenty of eye candy that should satisfy, although I'm sure many of the race cars shown are most likely CGI; it's hard to tell anymore."
"I had the same excitement going to view this film as I had in 1966 when I drove 90 miles to watch the movie Grand Prix. I would have liked to have seen more racing action. The sound was great, but my favorite racing movie is still Grand Prix."
"This is one of this year's best, from the cast's performance, the story, and the cinematography. It has good visuals feeling that you are really in the 60s. Bale and Damon's acting were commendable. I really did not expect to love this one a lot because I'm mainly not a fan of action movies. I expect this to be at least nominated for Oscars."
"I kind of, sort of, walked out of this movie. Not because it was terrible or anything but I just didn't care about the characters. The movie also wasn't very ""cinematic"" although I'm not entirely sure what I mean by that. Now, I am not interested in racing but if you compare this movie to Rush, a movie I waited to see because I wasn't interested in the subject matter, it's night and day. I really enjoyed Rush. It exceeded my expectations by far. This movie was not very good.The thing that bothered me most was Bale's performance and it might be the worst I've ever seen him do, although that's a pretty high bar. He plays a caricature of someone, not an actual character. And he ruins it for me because the whole family dynamic is awkward. There's 0 chemistry and it doesn't seem real in the least. I couldn't take him or the movie seriously. The scene when his wife is swerving all over the road and yelling at him was weird and out of nowhere. The son barely says a word.The movie is way too long. Every scene seemed to be the same after two hours. Let's have more shots of Matt Damon's character standing in front of the sun. Let's start every scene out with some classic guitar playing for nostalgia's sake to get you excited. The only good scene was when Bale's character talks about the perfect lap, that's it."
"'Le Mans '66 (2019)', known simply as 'Ford V Ferrari' in America, is a sports biopic that aims to tell the story of the two men who forged Ford's first racing car. While it initially seems as though it's going to get lost in the corporate politics of car manufacturing, it soon becomes clear that it's far more concerned with its two leads and their strained-but-loving dynamic. By doing this, it skirts the usual biopic issue of cramming a hundred-and-one life events into a two-hour run-time whether they're really relevant or not. Basically, it crafts a compelling narrative from its 'real life' story, adapting things in a very satisfying way. The lead performances are up there with the best of the year, a chalk-and-cheese duo who light up the screen whenever they're on it. Bale, especially, is fantastic, sporting an accent and a slimmer frame in his typical chameleon way. Another star is director Mangold, whose assured direction makes for an engaging experience both on and off the race-track. The racing scenes are the thing's highlight, though; they're fast, suspenseful and technically sound. The piece manages to get you invested in the inner workings of such driving, and such cars, even if you've never given it a thought before. This allows everyone to be on the same page for the stunning finale, which is certainly an edge-or-your-seat sequence. The affair makes a point to take a step back now and again, slowing down for often overlooked character moments and rumination on the hidden beauty of racing. Indeed, it feels like a car fan's dream, dipping into the intricacies of bespoke car manufacturing while featuring a bevy of sleek vehicles, to boot. It isn't exclusively for this crowd, however. The story is resonant and the characters are well-rounded. It is a bit straight white male centric, having only one female character and relegating any people of colour to background roles. It feels old-fashioned in that sense, like a film from the period in which it's set. While better representation would be appreciated, its absence doesn't feel like a product of malice so much as an attempt to convey some sort of 'period realism'. Its plot does feel rather 'us v them', primarily because it associates Ford with America and Ferrari with Italy. Ford, the man, even seems to have a racial motivation, although this could be an unintended result of an early xenophobic comment. Really, though, the decision to position a massive corporation as an underdog is simply to fuel better drama. Still, these are pretty much the picture's only major flaws. It's a good movie that fans of its focal sport should get even more out of than I do. 7/10"
"Definitely one of the best race movies ever, but with a buddy-friendship story ode to Ken Miles and Carroll Shelby plot as well as little guys against the big establishment that any non-car guy could enjoy, so your wife will enjoy it too. My wife loved it, but she does drive a 429 hp AMG E53 cabriolet, so she's definitely an honorary car guy.See it in a good theater with a full sized screen and top sound so you can experience the amazing race cinematography and feel the roaring engines in your chest.Christian Bale gives one of his his best Oscar worthy career performance as Ken Miles, from a long list of career Oscar quality performances in movies like Vice, The Big Short, The Fighter, and American Hustle.A must see future iconic movie right up there with James Garner's Grand Prix and Steve McQueen's LeMans.Now, every time I get into my 2009 911 C4S, I want to wind it out in second gear to over 7000 rpm's just to hear the engine scream."
"Watched this morning at 10 am. Wow. What a film. Matt Damon and Christian Bale are a great team on screen. Possibly the best movie I have seen Damon in. Bale, as usual, is sublime. The supporting cast are brilliant, especially young Noah Jupe, who surely has a great career ahead of him, rather like Mr Bale has and continues to have. You don't have to like cars, but if you like great movies with great performances this is for you. A shoe in for the Oscar nominations."
"Well who'd of thought it?
Take a true mondern day great (bale as ken miles) and a gifted actor as damon playing the legend of carol shelby
Give them a good story of mostly true events and wow you've a GREAT. FilmNow who would of guest that?????In this day and age of monster films dominating the box office this adult orientated movie is a gemIt also looks like the two main actors really had a blast making this film"
"I loved it, that chemistry between Damon and Bale was fantastic. If you like cars and races this is a grail."
"I hate car racing but this long movie - nearly 3 hours - held me fixed to the screen. Superb acting, astounding cinematography and a great story made it worth every cent.And the cars; this was a time when cars were not seen as being evil as climate alarmists tell us but both works of art and amazing bits of machinery. But the real essence of this story were the men who built and raced the cars.I recently wrote a review for the reboot of Charlie's Angels which was filled with snowflake issues and PC writing. A fun franchise had been ruined. Ford v Ferrari however demonstrates that Hollywood can still put out a great movie which hasn't been ruined by woke points of view. There were no little girls competing with the men in this incredibly tough occupation and boy did the movie benefit from that. Carroll Shelby, played by Damon and Bale as Ken Miles, both legends of racing and cars were spot on in a masterfully directed bit of recent history. Having said that Catriona Balfe was superb as Bale's wife.One of the year's best."
"Ford vs. Ferrari is a retelling of the Ford company's attempts to compete with Ferrari in building racing cars and win the Le Mans race and the designer and driver behind getting the tasks done. This is just a really well put together, well written movie that looks at the passion for something in contrast with the constraints of the business world.The direction on this is tight. It looks nice and the pacing is pretty smooth for a two-and-a-half hour movie. Director James Mangold (Logan, Walk the Line) really knows how to make scenes visually interesting, throwing in little stuff. Though there isn't really that much racing in this, the race at Le Mans really pays off your expectations.Matt Damon and Christian Bale are the leads in this, the former being the guy who tries to work within the system and the latter being the guy who can't. Matt Damon gives a fine performance, but it's Bale who steals every scene he's in. The famously versatile actor completely sells the character of driver Ken Miles, both brash but charismatic. I'll be very surprised if he doesn't get an Oscar nomination. To be honest, the casting even to the smallest characters is pretty darn good. Props should be given to Tracy Letts as tough, intimidating boss Henry Ford II.The only weak spot I found, and it's more of a knitpick, is that they could've cut down on the scenes of Miles interacting with his family. It's good stuff, but it can be a little repetitive.Overall, I highly recommend this."
"When a story speaks to you, it silences you. That's exactly what it did.
It silenced my mind.It has the quintessential moments of a mainstream drama film. The film and especially the star cast create a beautiful setting as the story progresses.Christian Bale stands out! Matt Damon is brilliant in the role!Go watch this film with your family and friends!
You will enjoy this more, if you have automobile enthusiasts in your group. Even if you don't it still is a great way to get hooked to the world of automobiles."
Perfect movie for a racing fan. Watch it if you wanna feel alive
"Excellent movie. Nice casting,Nice Screen play. Very good direction..Overall excellent.."
This movie is so good. The cinematography and Bales's acting was fantastic. Even people who are not motor heads can watch this movie. This piece of art will inspire many people to experience racing at least once in their life time.
"There are movies that give you 100% of what you expected and there are movies which exceed expectations in every way possible and blow your mind away. Documenting the le Mans race of '66, this team has delivered a vintage classic that is as classy as a scotch straight out of the cask after maturing for decades!Set up in the 60's, the Ford Motor Company is in pursuit of a new design that will take them back to the glory days. Henry Ford II (Tracy Letts) gets a path-breaking idea from his marketing team to design a Race Car, like the legendary Ferrari. After failing in an attempt to buy out Ferrari which is broke, Ford decides to build a race car on its own and commissions Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) for the job. Shelby takes the help of Ken Miles (Christian Bale), a hot-tempered British racer who is struggling to make both ends meet. While Miles's addition to the team adds tremendous improvement to the design, the Marketing Head Leo Beebe (Josh Lucas) wants him out of the team. How Shelby and Miles manage to achieve the American dream of winning against a Ferrari at le Mans is the remaining plot.What fascinates the audience is that the movie starts like a documentary and picks up pace in no time to make everyone watch it literally at 7000rpm. Whether a person is into cars or not, the detailing given to every aspect of a race car and how it is tested and done is prone to give a 'car-gasm'. Christian Bale and Matt Damon will definitely be serious contenders for the Oscars along with Leonardo Di Caprio, Brad Pitt and Joaquin Phoenix this year. Their transformation into the role is top class. Another noteworthy character is Josh Lucas portraying Leo Beebe. While he is pure evil as a personality, he is a pure genius at what he does and how he gets it done. Thank God for this is just not a 1hr30mins affair. The movie runs for a good 2hrs32mins and it was still not enough.Pure Gold!!!"
Well scripted and picturised. Legendary history and great performances.
"Movies about a big race or an upcoming sporting event have been done a thousand times before and they all have one thing in common - that you must win against overwhelming odds.Add this one to the list as well. So what makes this one special? Nothing in particular.. But its a Damn entertaining movie. Well written, well acted, excellent characterization, well directed.This is great entertainment. Go for it.. you wont be disappointed."
"Text: It has adrenaline from start to end with touches of drama. Excellent tempo. Very good script and direction. Very convincing performances. It is accompanied by a very good music that immerses you along it. The movie lasts 2 hours 32 minutes and you don't feel them, it's worth it, you enjoy every goddamn second. I hadn't felt this way for a long time, and I don't know about cars and they don't attract me, but the movie is made with love, in addition to everything you learn from history with this based on real life. I could watch it a thousand times."
"Batman v Superman, Freddy vs. Jason and Kramer vs. Kramer, there's been plenty of battles of the heavyweights depicted before in Hollywood however, none of them have been as fast or as furious as Ford v Ferrari (or Le Mans '66 as titled here in the UK), an adrenaline fuelled race to be the best from director James Mangold.American car designer Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) and driver Ken Miles (Christian Bale) battle against the corporation and themselves to build a revolutionary racing car for Ford to challenge Ferrari at the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1966.Le Mans '66 does what every great sports film should do in making you care about the characters first and foremost while the sport actually takes more of a backseat. The racing is, of course, rather prominent however, thanks to a great screenplay and James Mangold's direction, Le Mans '66 becomes a thoroughly entertaining ride of courage and determination that makes for such compelling viewing.When the race sequences do come mind, they are as impressive as you can get, the ferocity of the competition really jumping off the screen, accompanied brilliantly by Marco Beltrami's pulsating score. It really is edge-of-your-seat thrills delivered at a blistering pace, the stunning visual effects and close proximity to all the racing action truly making this a cinematic experience to remember.Coming to the performances, Le Mans '66 features two great lead performances from Matt Damon and Christian Bale, both lighting up the screen whenever present, particularly when sharing a scene. Throw in some strong support from the likes of Jon Bernthal and Josh Lucas, and Le Mans '66 becomes an even better film with a great ensemble on board.What makes Le Mans '66 work so well for me is that you don't have to be major racing enthusiast to find something to enjoy, James Mangold making an incredibly accessible film for all to enjoy. I found myself enjoying it as much as Ron Howard's Rush a few years back, which is not a bad thing, at all."
"What an exciting movie! Well done on every level: character development, cast, tempo, acting, stunning!"
"What an incredible film, great pace, amazing acting, a story that sucks you in and takes you on a ride. I thought that it may feel too long but the time flew by and I didn't want it to end!! The 4d staging was perfect too. I'm heading back for this at the cinema again for sure!"
"One of the best movies I have seen in a long time. Drama, action, comedy, sick racing scenes. Loved the relationship between the father and his son as well as his wife. The movie kept me interested the entire time.
Christian Bale played his part so well. Matt Damon was awesome as well. In fact, the entire cast was great.
This is one movie that you will want to take the family to see it on the big screen.
My 12 year old said it was the best movie he has seen in a long time. That is something special coming from a kid his age.
Thank you Hollywood for coming out for a great movie that breaks your heart and cheers your heart."
"Awesome cast, awesome acting, awesome action. Best movie of the year for a motorhead.
Enjoy"
"This movie has thrilled to a lot of people, in case, I saw a good movie, but not good enough, normal, I am so sure i will not see it again, i must admit it has a great edition and music"
"Christian Bale gives an outstanding preformance as Ken Miles in this movie. He really portrays the character credibly. In addition, the chemistry between Matt Damon and Christian Bale is sublime. You also get a really good view into the corporate side of things and understand what is at stake for Ford and Ferrari. Perfect movie for all car lovers!"
"Been said before 2 and half hours fly, great action scenes and brilliantly written, a must see on the big screen!"
Great cast. Great direction. Great dramatic storyline.
"Ford versus Ferrari is too bland of a title for this amazing movie. International title Le Mans 66 already sounds much better. I would however propose Miles & Shelby: Friendship Through Racing. This is what the movie is all about. There is a lot of competition, culture, drama, hardship and racing in this film but once you have gotten the bigger picture, this movie really is about the friendship between an ambitious constructor and a tough driver.This gem of a movie convinces on numerous levels. The settings are authentic and bring the United States of America, Italy and France of the mid-sixties back to life. An old sports car here, an iconic poster there and legendary race circuits bring back the pioneer age of race driving.The actresses and actors are doing an outstanding job. Christian Bale and Matt Damon are two of the greatest actors to be around and they underline their excellent reputation for two and a half entertaining hours. Christian Bale convinces as rough guy with a tender core who cares as much about his own success as he does about his son who idolizes him. Matt Damon incarnates an ambitious entrepreneur who always strives to make the impossible possible. The supporting actors and actresses are also noteworthy as Caitriona Balfe convinces as resilient, smart and emotional wife and mother while Remo Girone delivers the goods by incarnating legendary entrepreneur Enzo Ferrari.The story is obviously also addictive as viewers care about the fates of the charismatic protagonists. The plot might be predictable, especially if you have some background knowledge about the actual events this movie is based upon. This however doesn't reduce this film's enjoyment because everything is crafted with authenticity, detail and wit.In the end, anyone who likes racing must watch this intense drama despite a few minor lengths. Those who were longing for a similar movie after the astonishing Rush six years earlier, will finally get something to crave for. Ford versus Ferrari is one of the most emotional dramas of the year and best enjoyed on the big screen at your local movie theatre."
"In my opinion this film is the best film of the year. The acting is amazing. The music is perfect. The cinematography is flashy in a way that suites the film. The story is brilliant. Based on a true story, this film kept me captivated the whole time I was watching it and it made me want to watch the real Le Mans this year. Excellent watch. A must see"
Well done guys! Lots of lessons for life that make you think. Touching movie.
"Ford V Ferrari is a sensational film. The cinematography in general is simply incredible, as the racing scenes and the emotion only add to its brilliance. Christian Bale is absolutely fantastic, Matt Damon is spot on and at his best, and Jon Bernthal is excellent as well. The soundtrack, score, acting, and directing are all exceptional, complimenting the film beautifully. Bale and Damon's performances are Oscar worthy, no doubt. With only about a month left of this year, Ford V Ferrari overall is easily the best movie of 2019."
"In a time where very few good movies come to us, this is a gem. This is a throwback movie if your looking for a movie tainted by nonsense this ain't it. Bale should win an oscar for this performance. Ck it out its probably the best overall movie this year."
"I usually don't like racing movies, but this one is amazing, it is really intense, sad and alot of drama. This movie have 3 of my favorite actors of all time, Jon Berthal, Matt Damon and Christian Bale. Well written script and then when it said that it was a true story, I was blown away. Watch this film if you are a fan of amazing and emotional movies. Must watch for every movie lover!!!"
Very impressive movie! Beautifully directed by James Mangold with some amazing performances by Matt Damon and Christian Bale. The racing parts felt like Gran Tourismo and were very enjoyable. Definitely a Golden Globe contender if not an Oscar contender.
"This is a movie and not a documentary. A documentary is primary a source of information. A movie is primary a source for intertaning. Movies will dramatize and change the story for better intertaning.
I recommend this movie but if your really interested in Ford versus Ferrari check some out some documentary's or even better a number of books that are available."
"Excellent well made movie overall and bale is abnormally amazing delivering an Oscar winning performance but the ending is cruel and unforgiving I can't give away the rest due to spoilers, of course that doesn't take away from how the rest of the film is, overall some serious eyecandy"
"There is a lot to love and a lot to be frustrated about in Ford v Ferrari, which seems to be becoming a trend in Mangold movies (except The Wolverine - there's truly nothing to love in that horribly misguided movie). It is certainly an exhilarating car movie and underdog sports movie at its core, and the racing scenes are gorgeous and put the audience right into the driver's seat. It's a tight script which particularly shines in its dialogues between Shelby and the Ford execs or Ken. Bale is absolutely amazing, stealing every scene and injecting joy into all of the racing scenes.The biggest flaw of the movie is its apparent disinterest in its characters. Shelby is a great example of this - with the background we get early, I wanted some allusion or discussion of how he's devastated he can no longer race but loves being a part of the journey with Ken. None of that was ever implied, and that also gets at a larger and apparently controversial take: Damon's performance was disappointing. He was completely opaque and detached, never successfully selling me the anger with Ford or the love for working with the cars the way Bale did. Some lens into the psychology of the main characters and why racing meant so much to them would've been great. The race ending was fine in showing executive duplicity, but would've been better if we knew anything about the other Ford racers (and truthfully many explanations were left unsaid about how the process worked). The ending, while completely fitting in script, was rushed and sudden, making it less impactful than it deserved.It's still fun as a sports movie, leaving no moments of boredom while it flies through it's 2:32 runtime, but for a movie that tries to hit emotional notes and focus on its character interactions, I'm perplexed at how no investigation of their characters or themes of dedication to a lifelong passion existed whatsoever. A fun and good movie, but should've been a great one."
"This is made by the filmmaker who previously did a lot to inspire Walk Hard, so it may be redundant to say that this biopic about the Men Who Raced Hard in the 60s has conventional moving parts and mechanisms in its plot and certain (ok most) characters.Aside from an ending that isn't a surprise or shock given how clearly (or blatantly) it's set up in the three-point Set-up/Reminder/Pay-off style in conventional screenwriting, this even has the kid who is there so that some of the grown-ups can explain things involving making some of the turns and, oh, being set on fire and surviving (not to say that this guy Ken Miles didn't have a son I'm sure he did that's not what I'm saying I'm talking about the TEXT of the story for pete's sake). Id even say Josh Lucas is only here because the writers think the stakes of a 24 hour race aren't enough so one needs the Corporate Suit Who Is Against Our Rebel Batman-Driver (and not to say there weren't pencil-pushing hacks at Ford then, I wasn't there and neither were you, but it's a total cliche thru and thru).....YET, There's two things. First, to make a car analogy again because it's fitting, Ford v Ferrari works and moves like a dependable and well-oiled machine and which, not to get off on a long tangent because who the hell has time, would probably please journalists nowadays looking for ""Pizzazz"" with otherwise enthralling events (sorry if you know what Im referring to and I digress on current events), it also has star-actors who get to find subtleties within the little beats of the script and/or where Manhole finds a moment to let it breathe (a pivotal character beat between Ken and Mollie where she speeds like hell to get the bloody truth out of his man ends up being one, and so in the very last scene with Shelby and the kid), fantastic cinematography and editing and a score/song selections that rock immensely, and Tracy Letts (writer of Bug and Killer Joe) hilariously crying like a baby at another key scene in a fast car.Second, the climax threw me for a loop in a way that made me very pleased - especially, as odd timing and weird I won't say luck but happenstance would have it, as this is a former Fox movie but now ""owned"" by Disney - because it speaks to a strong, hard lesson about what can happen in following the Corporate Line. Ken could go one way and be the independent rock star hero he is to himself and his son and a few others, or follow what he's been told will look good for a photo. His decision at first seems like and is deceptively a ""Good"" beat, where it's almost like the movie is saying, ""yeah, sometimes you gotta suck it up and do what they tell you."" But the actual consequence of this turns it on its head, and while the film doesn't hold on it for too long, it still resonates in a world where so many people are told to do something a particular way, and it opens one up to get... Screwed.I don't know if I read into it too much or the way the filmmakers intended, but it puts an excellent bow on the underlying subtext (or flat out text, your pick) about how to get ahead or not get ahead or simply the pitfalls in a world dominated by corporate interests.Oh, and it's a helluva adaptation of Speed Racer and/or Mario Kart, you decide there."
"Playing out the real life story of how Henry Ford the 2nd vowed to get revenge on Ferrari after a failed takeover bid that left him feeling humiliated, so decides to crush the Italian team at the infamous 24 hours of Le Mans endurance race.Note : In the UK, the film title is 'Le Mans '66.This story has been told by Amazon Prime's 'The grand Tour' too, and they had the good sense to keep it short to around fifteen minutes and included more technical information that this movie lacked, which would have helped to build a more rounded picture, this picture is aimed at appealing to motor racing fans in general, technical information is part and parcel of being a fan, it is not solely about the drivers, this film feels dumb down a little too much for it's own good.The film, good presentation and accurate feel, Matt Damon plays the part of a man forced to give up racing due to ill health and focus on something else related quite well, Christian Bale is excellent as rough around the edges racer Ken Miles, it is nice to see Jon Bernthal as something other than a brutal thug that he is often cast as, Caitriona Balfe provides an excellent supporting role.However, the film is too long at two and a half hours, a good twenty minutes could have been cut from this without removing from the core story, the relationship between Carroll Shelby and Ken Miles is the core focus at the expense of the more important finer details, such as the film's main protagonist Ferrari and his team of drivers, and instead pays attention to the boring politic's of Ford's executives, namely Leo Beebe trying to win the race his way when Carroll actually knows what needs to be done.Overall the film is good, but it is something better enjoyed at home rather than a movie theatre, I don't regret going to see it, but I was not blown away by it either."
"I love a good film based on historical events. I knew I had to see this in IMAX format as soon as I heard about it. I'm not the biggest gear head but I do know the talent of the cast involved and the director involved so I knew we would be getting something worth watching. Having seen this in IMAX now, I will say that this film needs to be seen in that type of high quality to feel the rush, intensity, and thrill of the races. This film is a bit long in the tooth but a great watch.The film is about the real life events of Caroll Shelby working with Henry Ford the Second to build a fast race car that would beat the best Ferrari has to offer. Shelby has a limited time frame to work with and enlists the help of hot headed Ken Miles, an exceptional race car driver who is initially at odds with the Ford company. The film follows their bond and their progress as they not only build the car but go head to head with Ferrari during the 1966 Le Mans race.The film's racing sequences are some of the best in a car themed movie I have ever seen. Heightened by the theater experience everything was eye catching and intense. On top of that you have two extremely charismatic leads who do very well in their roles. The film also has humor here and there. Its a very interesting and inspiring story and you don't have to be a car fanatic tot enjoy the film. James Mangold's quality behind the camera shows with every detail captured.My main complaint for the film comes from its running length. its a long 2 and a half hours and at times feels its length. I couldn't help but think a good half an hour could have been left on the cutting room floor. Its a one time watch through and through but a great effort. I think the film will be up for some of the more technical aspect Academy Award nominations. If you are a film lover, you need to see what is arguably the best racing movie ever.8/10"
Matt Damon and Christian Bale provided perfect portrayals of Caroll Shelby and Ken Miles.
"If you've ever seen one of these iconic cars, or like the Cobra, or just like a gripping movie, then this is for you.
I'm not gonna write a critique of the movie, just to say both my wife and I were engaged for the full length of time this went on.
Also to the makers, thanks, it truly is a brilliant film.
Oh and neither of us are motor racing fans, we just like beautiful cars!"
Best car movie I've ever seen! Really true to the time and with the right cars at the right time. Cast is great and a good sense of humor as well!
"What a great movie from the moment it starts, the chemistry between Christian Bale & Matt Damon is just excellent!Everything was great with this movie, a fantastic true story, cinematography, lots of heart and high adrenaline, totally transfixed whole way through, great seeing it on iMAX screen!"
Absolutely blown away by this movie. Actors and director do an awesome job of telling the breathtaking story of America coming out on top. Best movie I've seen in a LONG time!
"Ford v Ferrari is now my new personal favorite racing movie! It's the most fun I've had at the movies in a while!I went in to this not knowing much about the story, but by the end I was blown away! I had no idea how gutsy (and sometimes crazy) Carrol Shelby and Ken Miles were! The film is flat out fun, not just because of the thrilling racing sequences, but also because of the at times laugh out loud humor scattered throughout too, (though not enough to be considered a comedy).Matt Damon and Christian Bale both each give two of the best performances of their careers!
The racing sequences had my heart pounding with adrenaline and there were times I wanted to cheer!I could go on and on but really, do yourself a favor and go see this one, whether you're a car fan or not. You'll be caught up in the drama and the fun whether you're a gear head or not! It has something for everyone!"
"I've had a mild obsession with the GT40 since I got to see the winning car up close in 1966, just a few days after the race, so I am not an impartial viewer. Giving such a movie 10 stars may seem excessive, but for this type of film I think it's perfect. The characters, both central and peripheral, are performed perfectly, and the film includes the best in-car race footage since Grand Prix. Side note: the sound systems in modern theaters have often caused me enough discomfort to cause me to put in ear plugs, but the sound of a full-race 427 at high rpm didn't bother me at all."
Absolutely fantastic film in fact I'm a bit speechless at how good it was and what an incredible story Bale and Damon was fantastic in this film and I really got quite emotional in places it had everything well done to all the people who put this together 👍
"I am not a racecar fan, not a criticism. But with such a great cast, I was intrigued to know more about this story. A truly wonderful film, entertaining, inspiring, moving, and truly exciting. My opinion, easily the Best Picture of the Year, deserves the Oscar ..... I couldn't believe how long the film is, it went by so quickly and yet clocks in at well over two hours. I hope you enjoy it too! anthony plumer, portland oregon"
"I don't write many reviews. Seeing this movie drove me to leave one. Ford v Ferrari exemplifies all that's good about movie-making. We were totally enthralled with the story and it's historical significance. There was no shooting, mayhem or violence. One can walk away and feel proud that it's all about American ingenuity, grit and determination. Bravo to the actors involved. The entire effort ran on all cylinders! We loved it. Thank you."
"I have not seen a movie this good in years, and I see a lot of movies! This movie has everything. Truly entertaining from start to finish. Matt Damon and Christian Bale were absolutely fantastic and great to watch. The racing scenes were edge of your seat. I can't recommend this movie enough.... If you're looking for a great night out, then see this movie! You won't be disappointed!!"
"I enjoyed every minute of this movie. you did it again Bale, also Damon did and amazing job. all actors was great ..."
"Fantastic, keeps you on the edge especially during the racing scenes, Christian Bale and Matt Damon deliver strong performances as Ken Miles and Caroll Shelby, this is a must watch movie for all motorheads. Also got to know a bit of history about how Ferrari used Ford to get taken over by Fiat. Racing scenes at the Daytona and at Le Mans were well shot. This has to go down as one of the better roles enacted by Christian Bale post his tryst with DC comics as the Batman."
"ZERO woke. Just pure beautiful entertainment.Not even a racing fan, but I am a movie fan, and I've never seen such incredible racing scenes.Highly recommend seeing it in IMAX/Dolby. Hits you like a ton of bricks.So freakin good! 😭👍👍👍👍"
"Starts off a bit slow, but gets better along the way."
The movie is very well directed. does well to show what it takes to race behind the scenes. captures the emotions of both the lead actors very well.
"Christian Bale is astonishing.
An instant classic.
Ford v Ferrari is a Triumph.
Christian Bale and Matt Damon soar in one of year's Best Films."
"When it comes to cars we like them fast and furious, or at least for many that is the dream as handling the monster speed can be overwhelming. So that's where racing comes in, a means to extend one's self into the faceless visage of a Nascar or Formula One in hopes of seeing their heroes win. Yet, what goes into a racecar? For the die-hard fans and car enthusiasts they understand the mechanics behind it, but for fans like me, well there is a lot more under the hood of the vent. Today's movie is all about the battlefield of racing, though perhaps more of a look into the window of the past in the international racing venue. Tonight we look at the rivalry between two big car empires, in their battle for supremacy as I review:Movie: Ford Vs. Ferrari (2019)LIKES:Surprisingly Decent Pace
Funny
Plenty Of Character Integration
Seeing the Rivalry From Many Sides
The Technical Jargon Mixed Well
The Musical Score
The Sound Effects
The Heart
The Finale Of RacingDISLIKES:The Predictability
Loudness
The Drama Vs. Reality
A Little More Integration Of The Wife
The Ending After The RaceSUMMARY:Biography dramas usually don't run at a pace that entertains me fully, but Ford Vs. Ferrari succeeded in this endeavor and put the pedal to the medal in storytelling. The elements of describing the business deals, politics and even development of the car are all a carefully blended together to be engaging without being overbearing for this reviewer. It finds a way to make all this business jargon funny, putting just enough spite, attitude, and stubbornness to work and masterfully relieving the dialog heavy plot. What impressed me even more though was seeing the character integration into this film, finding ways to make characters I care about and how I hoped the policies would not shoot them in the foot, which is key to helping me stay invested in a drama. Bale in particular was my focal point, his character having the most lines cast out and the central engine that drove this car. He plays the part well, adds that charm he brings to many of his roles, and then melds with the rest of the teams. Throw in all the dialogue filled with the jargon and you had me feeling like I was part of each group in the decision to battle the big boys.
However, despite all the heart of the film, most fans are going to want to know how the special effects department works in this film. Good news, for America's love of making things loud, bold, and powerful continues on this look back into the past. For guys like me, the musical score at times amps up the elements with its background noise augmenting the scene and making my skin goosebumps rise in that emotional way. Now add the layer of the sound editing and effects and you get the major effect of this movie. Those who love to listen to their engines roar as they fly down the street, or identify the clicks of the perfect transition to the next gear are going to love this movie. All those elements brought together with the theater sound drop you into the driver seat and gets the blood pumping. Finally, combine that with the visuals and you've got yourself a movie that somehow takes what many consider a dry sport of turning left and instead give you the dynamic element of being in this life or death thrall. When combined with the story, it's magic and gives a purpose to remain entertaining, which can be very difficult in a racing movie without gimmicks (comedy of the Love bug or action of the Fast and Furious).Despite the realistic nature of this film though, it still has some elements I would have liked to see curbed. One, the predictability of the film is still there from the foreshadowing alone, though if you know the history of this movie's plot you'll of course predict the ending (which I didn't). Despite the appreciation for the special effects, yours truly has sensitive ears, so the full volume of the engine roaring can be a little painful/ingratiating if not careful. These minor components aside, the movie's constant question of drama vs reality comes into question, and I feel there was a lot of magic integrated into the film compared to the reality. It adds entertainment, but I wonder just how much of this was true to paint the characters a little more notably, more so Matt Damon's character or the arrogant vice president. In terms of further character integration, I would have liked a little more of the wife, who though was involved throughout the film, felt there was a little more she could have had in here to really pull the film to full circle. My biggest dislike though was the last twenty minutes of the film, which I will not spoil. The film had another point that I felt would have been better to end, and while I understand why they did the last part in terms of closure, the last 15-20 minutes could have been edited down where I think the true story ended, wrapped up with a nice information card montage they do. It's times like these where the last piece is placed that sometimes throw me the wrong way, but I will of course recognize the honor and work they did do in those final moments.The VERDICT:Overall, Ford Vs. Ferrari delivered what I expected and more. It was a drama/biography that was not boring to watch, with a pace that like the car continued to work and immersed you into many aspects of the war between these two. A fantastic balance of story with technical prowess is going to be the entertaining factor for much of the audience and looking at the people around me during my showing should impress the target audience. Sure, it's predictable, a little time bloated, and loud, but the only factors are potentially the movie magic blowing things out of proportion and the potential ending that really had me bugging. Otherwise, outside of not being the most original idea or the most dynamic telling of a story it works for a trip to the theater.My scores are:Drama/Biography/Sports: 8.5
Movie Overall: 7.0"
"A must see for all car lovers, It's a legendary tale of the Ford GT40.
The film could not have asks for a finer ensemble cast. You got Damon you got Bale. That dude who played the Punisher. A whole bunch of other people doing a terrific job.
It's a great story filled with humor and excitement.
Plus it's a bonafide sports film. It's a great example of true sportsmanship.
Worth the imax ticket."
"This is a sports movie that I want to compare with Borg v McEnroe and perhaps Rocky. And this movie just falls a little short of those movies, for me. Perhaps it is that car-racing requires such complicated mechanics in a team-effort to be successful, as compared to a simpler pathos in one individual's endeavour.Also, I am wary of a film trying to bring me in with its *wink**wink*intheknow knowlege of cars and jargonist language about cars. It's meant to explain things to a viewer and bring them in, and mock the characters that ought to be mocked (because we're intheknow, and they aren't). For some reason, I was aware of and resisted such attempts. Alongside my experience here, the storyline was adequate and just escaped being hokey, and the characters were adequately pitiable and relatable.What I was really impressed by was the foregrounding of the LeMans lap, and then visually punching us with that pre-knowledge when the actual race was on. The scenes were visceral and this boosted my rating.I thought the edit and shots taken and varied between close-up and other were all done well. Would love to compare shots with Logan, Walk the Line or Copland, just to see.Matt Damon does his best Tommy Lee Jones impression with his voice, I thought. Just throwing that out there.An alright film, and probably better than other car-racing films. Car-racing? why not, just for this story."
"Both have their atturide , not fading up infont of each other. tremondous chemistry, the end monoloige was great the 7000 rpm one. Will keep fighting for oscar.."
"My dad grew up watching and listening on the radio about Fords attempt to beat Ferrari and he would share these stories with me growing up. So this movie was a huge deal to me. The movie does a great job how much it meant for America to beat the unbeatable Ferarri but also how snobby of a person Ford the 2nd was to his employees. Christian Bale and Matt Damon's chemistry was the best part of the film in my opinion. Bale stands out the most playing the crazy driver who got the GT40 to 220mph! I highly recomend this movie if you're a car lover, or even a history lover. Great work!"
"Ford v Ferrari has a lot of positive things, altough it didn t surprised me at all as an entire film. The movie explains with all the details the story we went to see but does not show us almost nothing emotionally related to the main characters, and that is unacceptable having Christian Bale and Matt Damon on stage. I had much better expectations"
"Ford v Ferrari is a movie with a great Christian Bale performance, and it tries to tell the interesting tale of the events leading up to Ford's incredible win at Le Man's. The way they choose to show this had a few great scenes, but ultimately was not as interesting as it could be in documentary form. The best example I can think of is the difference between Man on Wire vs. The Walk. Documentary is just the better format to tell this interesting story."
Best movie decision I ever made. Great acting and story. Matt Damon and Christian Bale both on top of their respective games.
#FORDvsFERRARI exceeded all expectations. Amazing performances from Matt Damon and Christian Bale. Great screenplay by James Mangold. I don't know how else to describe the experience other than it being perfect. Another movie on my very short list of (5/5Scales)
A must see for anyone who knows a little about cars. Matt and Christian were great together.👍🏻👍🏻
"Ford V Ferrari is a pure adrenaline rush from start to finish. It's an absolutely thrilling film that fires on all cylinders.Ferrari dominates the annual 24-hour race at Le Mans for much of the 1960s. Ford decides to throw their hat in the ring, in hopes that a victory at Le Mans will raise their struggling sales. The former racer turned car designer Carrol Shelby (Matt Damon) and his difficult, but passionate racer pal Ken Miles (Christian Bale) are both brought on to help Ford craft a car to get to the finish line.Beneath the technical polish and gloss of Ford V Ferrari, the friendship between Shelby and Miles is the heart of the film. Christian Bale and Matt Damon are a large part of what makes this film work so well. This is their first movie together and yet, they interact with the ease of old friends. Their performances complement each other. You get really invested in this on-screen duo with an absurd amount of charm exuding from the screen.We all love a good underdog and this film is a classic underdog story. Ford V Ferrari isn't just about the race at Le Mans, but more about the human struggles encountered to get there. Pride and jealousy constrict Miles and Shelby at times, but the rigid corporate system of Ford Motor Company poses a greater challenge. Ford V Ferrari is an expansive, mesmerizing real-life story that feels perfect for the cinematic medium.Ford V Ferrari puts you in the driver's seat with the racers, but not in the way I was expecting. The stellar sound design and mixing are some of the best and extremely transportive. They give the racing sequences not just an immersive quality, but a transcendent one. James Mangold's direction is excellent. He gives you sequences that put you on the edge of your seat and capture your gaze. More so, Mangold has a strong grasp on pacing. The film knows when to slow down and emphasize character and emotion and when to boost its engine and hightail it to the next scene. In a film this long, it's remarkable that it feels as breezy as it does. Even if you know this story start to finish, the skill, technically and narrative in which it's told make this ride one easily worth taking.I recommend Ford V Ferrari for ages 7 to 14 for language. Even if you're not a race car fanatic, there's a good chance you'll love this film. I happily give it 5 out of 5 stars. This is easily one of my favorites of the year."
Rarely go to movies unless I have high expectations. I'm also a car nut so I already knew the story. This movie exceeded my expectations and dramatized the story perfectly. The interactions of Damon and Bale kept me glued to my seat along with excellent racing scenes. I never once noticed how long the movie is and now that I'm wished it was longer. Great entertainment!
Great movie. A must see for the big screen. The sound is phenomenal.
"Wow. What a roller-coaster ride. Go in with a hesitant mind cause I not a fan of car racing. But this movie will bring u into the amphophere.Brillant acting, script, sound and director.The engine sound bring banquet feast to your ears. Most of the historical is correct with a little correction to make the movie interesting but that no bother me. Recommend watch this movie with a good sound system cinema!"

"It has adrenaline from start to end with touches of drama. Excellent tempo. Very good script and direction. Very convincing performances. It is accompanied by a very good music that immerses you along it. The movie lasts 2 hours 32 minutes and you don't feel them, it's worth it, you enjoy every goddamn second. I hadn't felt this way for a long time, and I don't know about cars and they don't attract me, but the movie is made with love, in addition to everything you learn from history with this based on real life. I could watch it a thousand times."
Absolutely spectacular movie. Damon and Bale were fabulous and it's non stop action from the get go. Thoroughly enjoyable movie one of the best ones I've seen this year.
"Disappointed ! Matt Damon might be a good actor but the script he was given is a dud. Childish arguments repeating throughout remind me of the 1968 Elvis movie Speedway more than a story depicting greats like Carol Shelby and Henry Ford 2. Having said that is is structured so that once you are sitting there watching you want to see the outcome, even though you know how it ends. There must have been 20 minutes wasted looking at the side of Christian Bales head while driving, with a competitor in the background moving back and forward in an unrealistic manner. The Butterworth boys would have done well to actually go to a race track and watch at least one car race. How many minutes watching a foot on a brake pedal and accelarator do we need to waste ? Surprisingly one of my friends has been to this movie 4 times, but he is a car guy, not a movie buff. It will appeal to Donald Trump voters I suspect."
"Ford v Ferrari is a biopic about American car designer, Carroll Shelby(Matt Damon) & race car driver, Ken Miles(Christian Bale). Carroll Shelby & Ken Miles have to fight against interruptions from the corporate higher-ups, deal with their personal problems & the various nitty-gritties of physics, to build a near-perfect race car for Ford to go up against Ferrari, at the 24 Hours Le Mans race of 1966.Ford v Ferrari is a mind-blowing film. Director James Mangold has given us a movie, that perfectly showcases the lives & friendship between Carroll Shelby & Ken Miles. The emotional scenes & the intense scenes have been perfectly balanced with generous doses of comedy, throughout. The racing set pieces are the highlight of the film. You actually feel like you're in the driver's seat, with all the race car drivers. The experience is just absolutely edge of the seat & mesmerizing! Matt Damon is outstanding as Carroll Shelby. Christian Bale is spectacular as Ken Miles. Damon & Bale share this effortless bonhomie & camaraderie, throughout. Jon Bernthal is brilliant as Lee Iacocca. Caitriona Balfe is excellent as Mollie Miles. Josh Lucas is fantastic as Leo Beebe. Noah Jupe is adorable & perfect as Peter Miles. Tracy Letts is superb as Henry Ford II. The supporting cast is great. Ford v Ferrari is a must watch. Race to a theater near you, as soon as possible!"
"I thought this movie was a really great movie. This is so different than all the movies coming out this year. The cars look and sound SO AWESOME. The acting is amazing I loved everyone one in the movie. There weren't any cringe worthy moments which I despise in movies. There were no CGI if I can recall in this movie, which means, everything in this movie was real. And honestly that exactly how it looked. I gave it an 8 and not a 9 or a 10 only because I feel like they could have given us more information about the main characters in the movie. I wasn't really sure why Christian bale and Matt Damon's character loves to race. We can clearly see that they do I just didn't really know why. But if you look over that stuff and focus on the great energy coming from everyone in the movie, then I know you will enjoy yourself"
"Well, now I know that the way to succeed in racing is get by your rival and give him a dirty look. Great acting and this movie looks fantastic, let down by the script. And anyone who thinks Ferrari was the ""underdog"" really didn't follow racing in the 60s. Yeah, Ford outspent Ferrari, but money doesn't equal wins, or Ferrari would dominate F1 today."
"Remember how much fun FAST AND FURIOUS was when it started and was about the cars with no CGI and lots of interpersonal dynamics and whatnot? That is this -- a movie for car people. I have raced and went with another car racer -- we loved it. The history, the speed, the cars, you could almost smell the gasoline. The performances are outstanding. The race scenes are breathtaking. This is a great movie! Lot of history here about Carrol Shelby I didn't know about. Fun!"
"James Mangold's 'Ford v Ferrari' is a fun two-and-a-half hour ride down memory lane, circling the lives of legendary race car driver Ken Miles and equally esteemed car designer Carroll Shelby.The film gets off to an uninspiring start, introducing the main characters using quick-hitting scenes that turn each into an eye-rolling archetype. Shelby is the inspired engineer. Miles is the irascible wildcard. Henry Ford II is the cutthroat Man of Industry ... and they even give him a sniveling bulldog lackey.The second half of the film picks up the pace and is considerably more engaging. Mangold does a fine job filming the racing scenes, choosing just the right balance of different viewpoints and cuts. Beyond that, he thankfully spares audiences from the awful ""shaky camera effect"" that some filmmakers would've used anytime they wanted to ramp up the action on screen.Given that the '24 Hours of Le Mans' race is indeed twenty-four hours long, Mangold also excels at keeping an even pace down the final stretch, not relying too much on either the racing or the off track drama, but rather striking an even balance between the two."
"Top executed movie for car lovers having all the race scenes that Rush was missing. Make sure to watch it in top quality cinema - you won't regret it.
Also great acting - Matt Daemon and Christian Bale really is a good match of chemistry. Some great scenes from the guy playing Henry Ford II.
All in all perfectly executed movie."
"Ford v Ferrari is clearly comes from a place of heart and a very talented director. The car races in this movie are dramatic, incredibly tense, and very well shot. There's a lot of production value and effort that went into making this film and it shows. The directing was probably the best part, no real issues there. I love James Mangold as well as almost all his films, so I'll always support him and I can't wait to see what else he does. This film was pretty strong from a technical standpoint, the cinematography, the editing, the sound mixing & editing, and the visuals were all great. The acting was pretty great, especially from Christian Bale. I really enjoyed Matt Damon and his performance, as well as the endlessly fun, charming, and believable friendship and dynamic that he shares with Bale. I liked his character and I think he had enough development for what screen time he had, but at the same time his character didn't feel that special or unique, but I did enjoy his character. In terms of acting though I think Matt Damon gets pretty outshined by Christian Bale. That just goes to show that he's one of the best actors working today, he worked on this film coming off of Vice, and if you've seen that movie then you would know that he looks radically different in this film. It's kind of amazing how much and how quickly he can lose and gain weight or a role. He's an actor who can disappear into his characters and he never feels like he's acting, and he can play such a wide range of characters, I mean this guy played Batman for crying out loud. He fully dedicates himself to all of his roles and he's one of my favorite actors who will always have my undying gratitude. In fact this might be his best performance that I've seen from him in a long time. His character is very well developed and the vulnerability on display is captivating to say the least. The film is very fast paced for the most part and it was pretty fun to watch. It got a little boring at times, and there were some points in the middle that lost my investment, but other than that this film kept my attention for the majority of the run time. And yeah the story is a little drawn out, not everything in this film was necessary or justified, they could've trimmed off maybe 20 minutes. My last issue is that it's one of those movies that is pretty pandering in terms of it's message and it's story, it's fairly cookie cutter and predictable. And it's one of those films that is just screaming that it's going for Oscars and it's very obvious, it's kind of an Oscar bait movie is what I'm trying to say. But despite some issues I really enjoyed this film, it's not amazing and I'm in no rush to see it again, but I'd recommend seeing this one in theaters, because the sound and visuals are so immersive that it makes this film a very theatrical experience. See it with a good sound set up as well."
"I generally steer clear of most biopics due to the staging of ""special"" moments, ripe with poignant dialogue and meaningful looks into the distance. In truth, life just isn't like that. It doesn't serve up the momentous on cue. The important and life altering moments often drift by, not recognised until much later. Having said that, this film has more than its share of these moments, but it's still an enjoyable and well told story. The leads are good and the narrative compelling. The racing action is gripping and while there are a number of stereotypes in the supporting cast, it's still well worth the money to see it."
"I hate the race ending You get chills,i think ken miles death is not needed"
"Entertaining, informational and fun to watch with great acting. I am sure this will be nominated for a lot of stuff. At two and half hours I just got bored with it."
"WARNING: After watching this movie, ANY sport other than auto-racing will be boring to you. If I was stranded on a desert island with only 10 Blu-ray movies to keep, this would be one of them.Primarily, this is a racing movie. Le Mans is a very special race in the racing world. Using 2 drivers, they race for 24 hours rain or shine. Obviously, the drivers are very important, but the building of an ultra high performance car that is driven 100% flat-out for 24 hours is the engineering challenge.The movie also tells the fascinating story between Ford and Shelby. A partnership that still exist today, you can still buy a Shelby Mustang for about $20,000 above a standard Mustang price. Clearly, the Shelby name means something to people looking for performance.About 60% of the movie is amazing car racing footage. Having said that, one of the most impressive scenes to me is when Shelby gives Henry Ford II a ride in the Ford GT. Fords reaction, is incredible, and an amazing piece of acting. You might look at Henry Ford II as a stuffy Business Man, but deep down inside he is still a ""Car Guy"" and he was blown away with the extreme performance of a 220 mph car.I consider myself a movie buff, I have over 3000 DVDs and Blu-ray's in my collection. I ONLY watch a movie one of two ways. In a movie theater or on a disc from my collection. I never stream. Most of my movies are from the 1930s to 1950s. But, Ford v Ferrari is nothing less than a masterpiece. If it was your job to edit out the boring parts from this movie, you could only eliminate 30 seconds, maximum.A movie like this is best seen on the big screen, the really big screen."
"A must watch of the 2019 movie year. What works for Ford vs Ferrari takes us to the World War 2 generation. In Ford vs Ferrari, we see a world of Alpha males who spar off in the corporate world and race track. Ford is belittled by Mr Ferrari and the Ford vs Ferrari feud begins. We see a corporate world of sharks with harsh words and a struggle to survive. On the race track, there is Damon (Shelby) and Bale (Miles) two alpha males who get into a fight but still are friends. Miles' Wife explains to Miles in one line: you survived W W 2 in a tank on D day all the way to the end of the war, after that experience nothing else scares Miles. Driving 220 miles was nothing, but an adrenaline rush. Shelby bet his company so Miles can drive. Era of risk takers with dirty tricks on the race track, mixed with guts and determination.
Ford vs Ferrari is a movie about a generation who pushed, and risked at a different time before safe spaces and the twitter mob. 8 stars."
"I must say, this is a movie that holds a perfect plot execution. Trust me, I watched a couple of true story based movies and not all of them succeed to deliver a fresh product while being 'a copy of something that happened in the past'. But Ford v Ferrari? The movie just nailed it. There's some kind of seasoning that the actors' performances and the movie itself added which makes every scene enjoyable, rather than a dull plus boring one.The performances of Bale and Damon, I don't have to say much. Their qualities are above all, especially Bale who had always played his role leaving a unique impression on the audience. This movie was another example of his fine work.So, whether you're a racing fan or not, Ford v Ferrari will always be an enjoyable offer even for the muggles. 9/10 for a masterpiece!"
"LeMans 66' shows just how much this modern age of access has made everythig meaningless, empty and easily discardable. We live in a world of fake news and social media drama influencers, influencing the creatuon of meaningless movie scripts and prequel sequels, while this cinematic gem portrays the good ol' days when things were ""real"" and had tangible value.I haven't been this thrilled in cinema since seeing Hitchcock's Rear Window for the first time. Damon and Bale portrayed their characters extremely convincing and kept me engaged until the end, strongly cheering for the maverick underdogs fighting competition and corporate pressure.This was based on a true story and in the end, pushing yourself to the extreme is the only way to find out who are you and what you are made of on your path to greatness."
"Have a wonderful drive watching it, the script, the direction, the actors, cinematography, all are spot on.
Really inspiring, escaping the cliques in the biography movies."
"Peacefully gazing into the dusk sky, racer savant Ken Miles, played by Christian Bale, lies on the race track next to his son Peter, played by innocently radiant Noah Jupe. Ken describes the experience of being one with his racing car: ""Everything slows down"". Ken says introspectively, ""You see everything."" That's the freedom and joy of doing what you love.Director James Mangold's ""Ford v Ferrari"" tells the story of Ford Motor Company's challenge of Ferrari in the legendary 24-hours race at Le Mans in 1966. Matt Damon plays Carroll Shelby, the American car designer, who Henry Ford II, played by believable Tracy Letts, asks to engineer a car to beat Ferrari at Le Mans. Carroll's volatile friend and elite driver is Ken.Carroll was the only American to ever win at Le Mans. But that was the glorious past. Presently, Carroll has a failing heart valve. His racing days are history. Now, he's the very successful businessmen, selling his designer cars to dudes, who don't appreciate his art, his love.In the movie's opening narration, Carroll describes driving his car at 7000 rpms. He's in the zone. His epiphany, ""The only question that really matters: Who are you?"" As much as ""Ford v Ferrari"" is about the landmark automotive racing milestone, I was touched most by the story by Jez Butterworth, John-Henry Butterworth, and Jason Keller in its poignant look at what we love, what is that meaningful to us.Christian Bale and Matt Damon have authentic screen brotherhood in the pursuit of their ideal, dedicating the best versions of themselves for what they truly love, that being racing. In the bigger picture of James's ""Ford V Ferrari"", 'racing' could be whatever is that meaningful to you. Christian and Matt give one of most their moving and humane performances. They're both Oscar worthy.At the 'dog and pony show' for Ford's unveiling of their Mustang car, Matt's Carroll accepts Ford's job to engineer a car to win at Le Mans. Charismatic Matt recalls the wisdom of Carroll's Father, who advised to do what you love, then ""it's no longer a job"". Matt poignantly says, ""Find what you have to do..."" Amen.Carroll sees the best in Christian's Ken. Ken is the 45 year-old World War II Hero, who's broke, and running his own automotive repair shop. His beautiful wife Mollie, played by strong compassionate Caitriona Balfe, is supportive of Ken, but so weary of working other jobs to keep the family afloat, including son Peter.Although, not classically studied Ken is the engineering savant. He amazingly diagnoses the imperfection of any car by just driving it. Yet, he's the strident smartass, who is blunt in his assessments to everyone. That runs amok with superfluous Ford Executive VP Leo Beebe, played by slickly good Josh Lucas.Predictably, Leo's egomania tests Carroll's loyalty to Ken, who might be the best race driver on Planet Earth. That might be the lone narrative downside. Also given this historical retelling, we kind of figure out how things go. Just saying.Phedon Papmichael's cinematography mesmerizes. Phedon captures the visceral impact of speed and danger in every turn in the larger expanse. Still, I was moved in the close up of Christian's visage on the speeding straight away. The calm serenity. Ken gets who he is.My favorite scene: Ken looks at the picture Peter drew of the racetrack. Christian's Ken meticulously describes what he has to do in each individual turn. Peter looks at his Dad in wonder. That's ""the perfect lap"". Peter asks, what if you can't race ""the perfect lap"". Ken smiles, ""You keep trying."" Because that's what you do for what you love. That's what makes ""Ford v Ferrari"" so very special too."
"This is the type of movie about how the little guys show up the big boys on the race track and prove to everyone that they're right and the nabobs are all wrong. I had some real emotional moments watching the racing (it's almost inevitable if you watch beginning to end) and I found this movie reasonably entertaining.It's a masculine tale beginning to end - the only female character of note is Mollie (Caitriona Balfe) as racer Ken Mile's wife, who for the most part seems to be in the movie as an afterthought. This movie treads a well-worn path as it unfolds almost exactly like every other car racing movie ever made, from ""Grand Prix"" (1966) to ""Days of Thunder"" (1990) while still managing to set itself apart from all of those, even if only in some minor details. Damon (as Carroll Shelby) manages to be a rock steady influence throughout the entire movie, applying his good-old American know-how to temper the hot-headed but brilliant racer Ken Miles (Bale). This movie has few or no surprises, but still manages to be a good watch from beginning to end.If you happen to be a fan of car racing, this is probably a must-see movie. For most of us it is a good, solid ""little guy vs. the establishment"" tale told mostly from behind the wheel (and under the hood)."
"Enjoyed film very much.
It showed a lot of the wrangling that the build team had with the management team just getting to Le Mans."
"Okay, get this out of the way first: 7000 revolutions per minute - the limit of the Ford 427 engine... or better, the limit of the valvetrain. A stock(ish) 427 will start to float its valves above 7k and lose power. This was it... it's not a hard limit, a few years later these FE motors were turning 8-8500rpms, but the screenwriter for some odd reason focused on this minutiae. Everything else is perfect; although we know what happened in '66, everyone in the theater was sitting on the edge of their seats. The sounds were great, the straight-cut gears in the gearbox whining louder and higher as the car accelerates, with the staccato of an almost-no-exhaust V8, all piped through THX speakers is close to a religious experience, especially as very few of us got to hear this monster live.
Acting is on point, finally a movie where Christian Bale doesn't have to fake an American accent, Matt Damon pulls off a seemingly effortless Carrol Shelby - no doubt weeks and weeks of acting work and watching Shelby interviews went into it, but the whole movie just feels like one of those special ones, where the actors just enjoyed themselves."
"+Great story telling
+Fantastic cast and performances
+Not a car fan but loved the drama and suspense-Not entirely factual but does lend itself to be explored outside of the film"
Christian Bale has just nailed the character provided by the fabulous direction. It was an exhilarating emotional ride with some of the fabulous performances of the year 2019. Christian Bale is sure to get the nomination for the Oscars. Background score and sound design was terrific. #FORDVFERRARI
"I have read several of the reviews posted here for ""Ford vs. Ferrari,"" and I generally agree with most of the criticisms: too long (15-30 minutes could have been cut, in my opinion), too many cliched scenes, and a very cliched character in the form of Leo Beebee, a Ford executive, who is clearly supposed to embody evil, soulless corporate greed (in case you have an IQ under 50 and can't figure that out within the first two minutes that character is on screen). Finally, I agree that Christian Bale's accent sounded cockney as opposed to Brummie--and I'm an American. Speaking of accents, I am surprised none of the nit-pickers here has mentioned something else I found slightly annoying: the character of Ken Miiles' son is portrayed by a boy with a strong English accent, but Miles' son was growing up in California and therefore would have had an American accent. Maybe the producers just thought a kid with an English accent would sound more appealing to audiences. (The child is a good actor, at any rate.)All that aside, even a huge movie snob like me found the film highly entertaining, and the length bothered me less than in other overly-long movies. (I believe most Hollywood movies in recent years could benefit from losing at least 15 minutes, frankly--Black Panther and Wonder Woman immediately spring to mind, although there are many others.) I did not go to see this expecting a documentary but rather to be entertained. I will add that I attended it with my brother, who is a former automotive journalist and therefore, to put it mildly, a real ""petrolhead,"" While he commented that there were definitely historical inaccuracies in the film, he genuinely enjoyed it as well. (Since leaving automotive journalism behind, my brother has worked in Hollywood, so that probably helps; he does not have any expectation that a Hollywood release is aiming for historical accuracy, since he knows that business well too.) However, I can understand why other automotive and/or racing obsessives might be more bothered by the film's flaws. If you are simply looking for well-acted, fast-paced (well, during the on-track scenes) fun, I highly recommend this."
"Enthusiasm for this movie will no doubt vary according to your interest in motor racing and the cars and drivers that make it. If, like myself, the sound of a 4.7 litre V8 on full song is akin to Beethoven's 5th, you will not be disappointed. Otherwise there is still much to be enjoyed here.The story revolves around Ford Motor Company's ambition in the 1960s to build a legendary racing car (the GT 40) capable of beating the venerable Ferrari team in Europe at the Le Mans 24-hour race. Loosely based on the real events, the thrills of speed, brilliantly portrayed in some superb racing footage, are complemented by the human drama as the racing team struggle with the monstrous Henry Ford 2 (superbly played by Tracy Letts) and his cronies and their own personal relationships. Matt Damon and Christian Bale make a great contrasting pair as all-American racing maestro, Carol Shelby, and cantankerous British racing ace and master engineer, Ken Miles, with tremendous performances from both. The strains of top-flight motor racing are excellently depicted via Miles' relationship with his supportive wife, Mollie (Catriona Balfe) and adoring son, Peter (beautifully played by Noah Jupe).Everything proceeds at a cracking pace and, unlike some car movies, the visuals are not overburdened with flash-and-crash CGI intrusions. A few cliched moments do not detract too much from the excitement and, at times, poignancy, of this highly enjoyable film. Vroom-vroom ....!(Viewed at Screen 3, Odeon, Warrington UK, 30 November 2019)"
"Great acting, cinematography, the race scenes where outstanding, good story tho obviously no surprises in the plot but the acting and characters really made this a stand out👌"
"A bright and easy watch that reminds me Hollywood can pass on truth and pride.
An altogether wholesome story that was very well oriented-Exemplifying dignity and morals by separating the heart driven characters versus the selfish/uptight moneymen....
& also showing that PG13 is a high standard in cinematic storytelling (Mangold must have a heart of gold).Matt Damon & Christian Bale had the love in their eyes as they played their roles with such grace."
"""High speed's and thrilling bumper to bumper sequences aren't the only things this movie has to offer. With it's touching bromance and charismatic characters Ford v Ferrari is an homage to the truly great Hollywood films of old, as it brings to life a great cinematic representation of one of racings most historical events and truly becomes a must see for everyone.""On the surface, Ford v Ferrari is portrayed as a touch and go film for motoring enthusiasts, but after seeing the film that couldn't be further from the truth. Director James Mangold who's name is widely appreciated after films such as Logan and 3:10 to Yuma has really proven to the audience racing films are no longer just for a certain audience, but can be enjoyed by all in this exhilarating biopic. The movie really stands out through its main characters' bromance between Carroll Shelby and Ken Miles played by Matt Damon and Christian Bale, delivering some of their best acting yet.The movie opens up with Matt Damon's Carroll Shelby winning the grueling 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1959 for the Aston Martin team before explaining that the victory was short-lived, as Shelby's racing career comes to an end due to heart complications. After being forced into retirement Shelby focusses on his vehicle design and sales career whilst at the same time the audience is introduced to the big boss of Ford: Henry Ford II played tremendously by Tracy Letts. This scene sets up the entire drive of the film as the big boss explains to all of his working staff that ford is coming to an end at the hands of bad business and poor vehicle manufacturing leading to Fords diminishing reputation. From here the movie kicks into gear as the idea of buying out Ferrari runs across Henry Ford from the marketing man Lee Lacocca (Jon Bernthal), but goes south and a rivalry is born as Ford wishes to beat Enzo Ferrari (Remo Girone) at his own game. At the 24 hours of Le Mans, which Ferrari has dominated over the years.Matt Damon produces one of his best performances throughout his acting career within this film. Showing the audience a very likable, charismatic and enthusiastic Carroll Shelby who will stop at nothing to overcome the challenge laid out to him by ford. Another nice addition to this film is Ken Miles' wife Molly (Caitriona Balfe), who stands out as a badass in her own right as she knows what makes Ken really shiver in his boots, and in one great scene really makes the soon to be famous racing driver crap his pants. This movie holds a plethora of great characters and fantastic acting that will definitely have the academy keep a keen eye out heading forward towards the Oscars.Another fantastic outline within this film is its score composed by Marco Beltrami and Buck Sanders which really captures the feeling of racing, from the intense drumming and guitar riffs to the loud trumpets of victory the score doesn't feel the slightest out of place as it sticks to the instrumentals that you would find in such a time period.As much as this film is great there are some flaws that audience members will definitely take away with them. One glaring flaw is this films run time clocking in at two hours and thirty-two minutes. The film at some instances does feel like it begins to drag on a little, but this does thankfully become resolved as once the boredom begins to settle in it shoots back up to a thrilling pace which does seem to be great, but maybe a cutback on some of the more slower scenes would really help this film shine more within the audience. Another glaring flaw I noticed wasn't necessarily the movie itself, but it's marketing. The marketing seems to highlight one thing and one thing alone, and that is it's a car film. I understand yes it is essentially a car-based film, but it is also so much more with a great narrative about true success and fighting for a goal as well as just what it means to show fantastic sportsmanship. However, most of these highlights within the film are overshadowed within the trailers and previews with just racing which leads to only one certain audience really discussing this film, that audience being motor enthusiasts when in reality this movie is for everyone.And finally, we come to the verdict of this film. As much as I enjoy this film I understand that people have differing opinions so instead of giving out a solid number out of ten I will leave a quick overview so you can decide whether to see the film for yourself. This is a high stake sports film with intense scenes and loveable characters that show great development as the story goes on. The film has an enigmatic score and really captures the feeling of racing in the 60's that really puts you on the edge of your seat as the characters resonate with the audience making this experience something amazing.Written by:

"The movie was hust great
I was in an awe of the way both christian bale and matt damon portrayed the charred
It was a balanced mix of action, drama, and comedy
The driving scenes were breath taking as wellI can say i just enjoyed each and every minute of it"
"This was good! VERY GOOD. Finally, a film that's not a comic book. A film about complex characters that still hits all the high notes that you want in a movie - moments of humor, moments of emotional depth, and an exciting final third act as you root for your heroes to win the big race that the entire movie has been building up to! More movies like this, please."
"The movie Le Mans '66 is based on a actual happened story. In a nutshell, the Ford motor company was in the market to buy Ferrari in the early 60's However Ferrari utilized the offer of Ford to get an even better offer from FIAT. An unexpected strategic move which pissed off Henry Ford II in that way, he wanted to take revenge on Ferrari by beating their cars on the black side where Ferrari was dominant for years in a row. So therefore the race engineering group Shelby got involved in order to design and construct the perfect race-car which is able to put an end to Ferrari and its years of overwhelming victory force.
The key-players in this movie are Matt Damon who plays Shelby and Christian Bale who plays Ken Miles.
Le Mans 66 is showing in a somehow funny way how the Ford GT40 was re-invented and perfected for racing at Daytona and finally Le Mans. Funny to see how racing was done back in the good old days and how things got so changed throughout the years. For instance: the pitlane was not separated by a big wall at Le Mans, but was actually on the racetrack. Safety features such as.....which safety features??! In those days racing cars were designed with paper and pencil and constructed with hammer and screwdrivers, no robotics or any micromanagement tooling. Analysis of race data was done by engineers and racing drivers, not computers.
In the movie Le Mans 66 you feel like you are actually in the 60's. You feel the power of a 7ltr engine, the adrenaline rush of the drivers you can taste yourself. The only thing missing is the smell of gasoline and of exhausts. I say: Great movie!!!!"
"First of all if you haven't seen the movie what are you doing in your life?
So I will this short, Christian Bale is one of the best actors today. He gave a wonderful performance in this film! And the relationship between him and Matt Damon is what makes this a masterpiece. Other thing is the racing shots and sounds of the cars was absolutely amazing. And by that I can say this is one of the best movies in this year."
"Great racing scenes and drifting , great cinematography, the acting is great obviously
Great story , not 100 percent accurate to the real one but it's ok, and yeah just every thing is great ,definitely reccomend a watch , plus the movie was 2:30 hours + and I didn't feel the time , actually I didn't know it was 2 and a half hours until after it ended"
"Beautiful, and creative in conveying the feelings of enthusiasm and joy and fear and anticipation, representatio is beautiful especially Christian Bell.
8.5 Fair rating"
"When The eigien running it feel like you behine the wheel and rasing the ""Le-Mans"". If you are the fan of race car you will love it."
One of the best films of the year. A gripping story and a top top performance by Bale
"Ford v Ferrari is one hell of a ride and a fantastic movie from start to finish.It's directed by James Mangold, he did Logan (2017) and Walk the Line (2005), and stars Matt Damon, Christian Bale and Jon Bernthal to name a few. When I first heard about it, all I knew was Mangold was in charge, and Damon and Bale were in it and I was already interested. And now that I've seen it...it's amazing.Probably the best aspect of this movie is the directing. Mangold does a terrific job here and the movie looks and feels superb. There are sequences that'll just move you to the edge of your seat.The performances are great as well, especially by Damon and Bale. Both their characters are an absolute joy to watch and the chemistry between them both is excellent. Bale's portrayal of Ken Miles is probably my favourite part of the movie. The character is just terrific and hilarious on the screen.The start and first act of the movie may be a bit slow for some people (I understood why but still thought it was fine). Other than that, I don't really see a flaw or issue.Ford v Ferrari is definitely one of the best movies in 2019. It's a whole lot of fun, excitement and joy packed into 152 minutes that feels a lot quicker than it is."
"""Ford V Ferrari"" Review
(7.5/10)Between its thrilling racing sequences and underlying commentary, Ford v Ferrari makes for a somewhat entertaining spin on the traditional sports biography.
On paper, a movie about the Ford company's efforts to defeat its rival Ferrari at the 1966 24 Hours of Le Mans probably only sounds interesting to either racing enthusiasts and/or anyone who actually knows what a 24 Hours of Le Mans even is. Thankfully, the final film, Ford v Ferrari transcends its biographical trappings to deliver an enjoyable viewing experience for gearheads and race-car novices alike. And with director James Mangold calling the shots, the biopic is mostly successful in getting at the heart of what makes this story interesting - namely, the struggle between commercialism and creative integrity.
At its core, the Ford v Ferrari script credited to Jason Keller and Jez and John-Henry Butterworth is part American corporate myth and part real-life story about a ragtag group of artists in their profession who're trying to stay true to their vision while working for a company that's far more concerned about public image and selling their products to the masses. Of the two, the latter element is more compelling than the former and gives the film a beating heart, even when it's all too apparent where the story is going next.
Ford v Ferrari knows what matters most are the people who come along for the journey. In this case, Damon and Bale have excellent chemistry as Shelby and Miles, and their dynamic gives the film much of its flavor, whether they're bonding over their shared passion for racing or coming to blows in what's typically a very funny fashion. Their personalities are well-complimented by those of Ford's business suits, with Letts and Bernthal doing excellent work as always and Josh Lucas bringing on the smarm as the Ford executive Leo Beebe (who proves to be the biggest thorn in Shelby and Miles' side).
The race-car sequences and recreation of the 1966 24 Hours of Le Mans are the primary attractions as much as anything else here, and Ford v Ferrari very much delivers the goods in this regard. Mangold and his DP Phedon Papamichael shoot these scenes with a steady hand, allowing viewers to actually see everything that's happening while still experiencing the sheer exhilaration that comes with being a body that's ""moving through space and time"".
Trouble is, it's all so very predictable. Miles loses his seat, but you don't think for a second that he won't win it back. Miles is losing the race, but you don't for a second think he won't pull it back. What these men achieved, in such a short space of time, was nothing short of miraculous. But that doesn't necessarily translate into an engaging story, and for much of its punishing run-time, Ford v Ferrari fails to get out of third gear. Like a race car without an engine, Ford v Ferrari looks good on the surface, but fails to motor for its 150-minutes. There's fun to be had watching the Ford executives clash, and the driving scenes are shot with real artistry and skill, but they're interspersed with scenes of true inertia. So while Le Mans might be the most exciting race on the planet, a film about that race is a very different proposition, with Ford v Ferrari lacking urgency and thrills, and instead simply chugging along in underwhelming fashion."
Great story and great performance from both Matt Damon and Christian Bale. The ending seemed predictable towards end of the race but I was wrong.
I loved every moment of this film! Fantastic acting and on screen chemistry. Light comical moments mixed with nail biting action and touching tenderness. For me this is an instant classic with everything you could want from a film and not one moment of boredom considering it's quite lengthy.
I don't normally rate movies but I really enjoyed watching this movie. I was a kid when this was happening and loved seeing the accuracy of this time period. This is such a great story. Thanks
Thrilling. The engines roar and your heart pounds. Excellent acting by Chris nolan and Matt. Outstanding making of the movie.
"Get your popcorn ready kids, cause you're in for a ride.
It was like watching the actual ""le mans 66""i was cheering like it was a live broadcast running on tv.
bale and damon, the new dynamic duo to appear on screen,bearing crazy resemblance to their characters they exceed expectations with their acting as well.
I've done my research yes, the film is as accurate as an arrow, with a bit of sprinkles on top they made it possible.
Definitely a huge oscar contender this year with its fascinating cast and crew delivering an absolute treat for the viewers.
The story of the decade that everyone should know about."
Bale 7000rpm ride with reference of Bourne ......completely worth movie
"This film had everything, tight direction, story, acting. It was funny, thoughtful and based on real history and it even had realistic action.
One of the best films this year, even my wife loved it."
"My family are big motor sport fans so I had to see Le Mans 66 or as it is mainly known Ford V Ferrari and this film was an experience and one of my favourite films of recent memory. The premise of the film sees two ambitous drivers try to create a Ford to defeat Ferrari at the 24 Hour Le Mans race. Christian Bale plays the lead in the film and he is fantastic in this film, he is so charismatic and charming and you truly care about his character in the film. An Oscar Nomination is waiting for him for sure, his chemistry with Matt Damon is brilliant and one of the best duos in recent memory. As said Matt Damon is great in the film too, he compliments Bale so well and his loud personality really works for this film and there is most definitley an Oscar nomination ready for him. Jon Bernthal is in this film and also does a great job, he is pretty likeable in the film and I felt like he was a character we were meant to like and sympathise with. The rest of the cast also do a great job, they all fit there roles brilliantly and feel like they fit into the movie flawlessly. The story is fascinating, seeing these two companies go to war over building a car is great, and seeing the different personalities clashing, it feels real and like these people are working on something that really matters. The script is great, a true mix of humour and drama, it makes everybody in the film feel very realy and interesting. The style of the film is breathtaking, the race scenes keep you on the edge of your seat and build the tension superbly, the film never really slows down and keeps you on the edge of the seat. Overall this is a pretty amazing film that needs to be seen by all film fans and will be remembered as a classic."
"It is a beautiful human adventure very well told. I'm not a fan of car racing because I think it's stupid. But in this adventure, the important thing is the innovation influenced by this great race at Le Mans and to push the limits. Great story."
"With an amazing production, great acting overall and a story filled with punches for those that don't know what happened (like me), it gets the job done and creates a very entertaining movie.
But I do think the story is too big or epic for its own good.
It feels not long enough to tell the whole thing, but also too long with boring moments or elements. Pass of time is poorly managed and it bothered me quite a few times.The races are perfect though. Visually stunning. And with together with all the car related stuff, made up for the best part of the movie in the perfect second act.
The acting, awesome. But is Bale, who gets the flashier role, that steals the show.
The movie is also quite funny, although not constantly. But when it makes a joke, it lands.I still think is a bit overrated though, because almost none of the emotional plots landed for me, and at times it felt a bit clichéd."
"It's not too often that we get to see some familiar faces (or names) on any film title released in recent times. A few examples would include Shia Lebouf (A Transformers Actor from the Bayverse) appearing in The Peanut Butter Falcon, Jesse Eisenberg's appearance in the Zombieland Sequel (For the obvious reason that it's been a whole decade since the first one came out), and Ian Mckellen (For the fact that Flushed Away was the last real big film starring Ian Mckellen).But all of that aside, Both Christian Bale and Matt Damon both did exceptionally well portraying both Ford stars that made the GT-40 become the next best thing in Ford Motor Comapny's legacy and popularity. Yet despite the year 1966 for being the second year of the Mustang, the GT-40 was the overall key to victory against Ferrari. The races needed to win were most certainly well-constructed to the point that it acted more like a VR experience than watching an actual race take place.Regardless, however you see this in theaters (Or otherwise), I'd greatly give out a recommendation to this in any way!"
"This film is definitely worth a go. It's based on a true story and this film will keep you glued to your seat because of its awesome racing scenes.
I have given 7 because I am not that fond of or fascinated with cars or else the film definitely deserves more."
Great movie with a good story and lots of race action. Matt Damon did an awesome job along with Christian Bale!
"A true story told well. Excellent acting from all the cast. The crew is also to be commended for the excellent work on this film. Great story and plot line, plenty of action. Fun, funny at times, serious at times, but at all times entertaining. Bravo! One of the best movies of the year. This movies is going to be a sell out. Get your tickets early!"
"If you love the cars and the stories that there are between those and his manufacturers like Ford (Ford GT40, Ford Mustang) and Ferraris, this is the movie.
The scenes with the first prototypes of the Ford GT 40 are amazing."
"Cant say anything. It was just perfect.
I looooved it."
"I loved this movie... the acting, the story, the racing scenes. It really sucks you in."
"I didn't think that I liked race car driving... until I saw this! The first half of the movie is interesting, but not as gripping as the second half. The first half focuses more on the business aspects of how Ford wanted to remake their image and ended up in an intense rivalry with Ferrari to make the best race car (and win an acclaimed 24 hour race). The second half feels more like a traditional sports movie, with the emotional pay-offs and suspense and heartache and twists and turns. You don't have to be into sports cars or be a fan of race car driving (I'm not) to appreciate this movie. The performances by Matt Damon and Christian Bale were superb as usual."
"Who cares about history? Dracula is not real he is just a fiction. So Ford vs Ferrari is something to feel good, to think you are a man but you are just a boy. Cars, intrigues, money, transactions, Ford, Ferrari you have everything in the same pool. You are not happy? Leave us! Good to see ""Tano Caridi"" after many years. Overall a very good movie."
This is feel good movie with great racing shots. Bale and Damon are awesome but I don't think they have any chance at Oscars. I was on the edge of my seat the whole second act.
"A spectacular journey filled with action, excitement, complex human relationships and great characters."
"Starting things off with Christian Bale, when Joker is released we all thought that Joaquin Phoenix is the chosen one for this year Oscar, but Bale's Performance is outstanding, I mean Matt Damon's Performance itself doesn't feel good enough because Bale shared the leading role with him. Astonishing. Now, let's talk about the racing scenes, OMG, Very exciting, entertaining, breathtaking, sorry Rush, but FVF beats you in this one. History wise, the movie is rich and worthy enough to be nominated for Best Scrennplay plus the idea of the behind-the-scenes secrets that happened during that time was actually, the best part of the movie. Straight 10/10, I don't find anything wrong about this one. MASTERPIECE."
"This movie is awesome, the actors performances are amazing and the story is even more. I felt part of the movie during all of it at the point where I didn't feel the 2.5 hours. I hope this movie wins an Oscar!"
This is feel good movie with great racing shots. Bale and Damon are awesome but I don't think they have any chance at Oscars.
If you like being placed in the seat of a race car while sitting in the middle of a movie theater then this is the movie for you! Totally awesome!
Great to see a well done movie that isn't based on a comic book-keep them coming Hollywood. Thanks.
"Fantastic film. Raw, gritty and peppered with humour. The film gives you a really sense of the unspoken bond between man and machine. Genuinely heartfelt at times, all brilliantly cast. Definitely worth your time!"
"Screenplay and directorial decisions are not something that would help make it a classic movie, however great acting really pulled my vote up"
"My palms were sweating, very very exciting and interesting. Even cried once too😑"
"While I'm going to have a couple of complaints from the script later, I want to highlight that it really does a great job developing 3 of the central characters to the film. Carroll Shelby is painted as driven but realistic, one eye on the prize and the other at keeping his team in line. He's passionate about his work but he's learned the hard way that his time in the driver's seat might have passed. I liked that he wasn't just a starry eyed dreamer and was fairly savvy about the challenges ahead and what doing business with Ford meant. Miles has similar traits, he loves to drive but reality hasn't always been kind to him either. He's very animated next to Shelby, both in his expression and his body language. But he has a deep knowledge of automotive work (makes sense, he's working as a mechanic when he's not racing) and a will to keep going. Miles and Shelby make a fantastic team, they form almost a yin and yang bond. I also thought Mollie Miles was a refreshing character. She's more active in the story than just a bystander, her love for her husband and her understanding of how amazing her husband's work was drawn with a light touch and I found their relationship to be genuinely sweet. The core players in this movie aren't just types (unfortunately that doesn't bleed over to the supporting characters... more on that later) and I think James Mangold and the screenwriters (Jez and John-Henry Butterworth, Jason Keller) did a good job presenting them as flawed but realistic people.You're going to want the drama when watching a racing movie. Its inherent in the risk of the sport and there's plenty of it here. But you're also going to want to watch some racing sequences. This movie has lots of tense and tightly filmed scenes with the cars and they lived up to the billing in that respect. They're exciting and they also do great job weaving them in to service the plot (the scene where Shelby drive Henry Ford around to show him how dangerous racing can be was a favourite). There's the triumphant moments but there are also bits that underline the gravity and there's some big wrecks that also serve their purpose. The set decoration, the costuming and the cinematography are all on par and nicely put together (consistent with a big budget production) and I have nothing but praise for Ford v Ferrari for its visuals and the actionThere's not only 1 A-list talent in the lead here but you have 2 of the best actors working in this movie and like I implied in the title, their performances hum along like the cars in the movie. Bale is the more expressive of the two, he's a fantastic actor and he completely throws himself into this role. He's known for being fully committed and the movie benefits from Bale's on screen antics. There are plenty of funny moments with Miles but Bale also knows how to grit his teeth and scowl just right when his character is pushing for that extra second off his time. Matt Damon is just a as good as Carroll Shelby, w0hile Bale walks the line between effective and overdoing it, he's more understated. But he's charming, his accent is on point and he's a compelling performer. I hadn't seen Caitriona Balfe in anything else but she absolutely held her own next to Bale and Damon. She's the most underrated performer in this and I was very impressed with her work. I liked Jon Bernthal, Noah Jupe and Tracy Letts in their respective supporting parts as well.Ford v Ferrari performs like a car right off the assembly line but it did have a couple of minor issues that could have required a pit stop. I'll admit that the movie got me with an ending twist but otherwise the overall arc of the script is pretty predictable. You get the expected highs and lows, it never really shocked me or shifted into the next gear if you will. I can't get angry at a movie for being too well executed for what it wants to be but I could have used a couple of decisions that would have taken it off the beaten path. This also applies to the supporting characters. Leo Beebe has no dimension other than being a power hungry sycophant, Henry Ford II does nothing but scowl and growl and Peter Miles has little other to do than be concerned about his dad. For a movie that has so much put into it, it also would have benefited from a little extra added to those characters to flesh them out a little.Ford v Ferrari crosses the finish line and it does so in style. All the facets of being a great sports movie are there with the acting, the camera work and the character development are all on point. I think it could have gone even farther but it is a good execution of a film in this genre and I can't fault it for that. I would actually grade this out at somewhere between a 8-9/10 but I have to round down in this case. I would definitely recommend seeing this on the big screen, it would add a lot to the action and help you enjoy the cinematography just that much more."
"When I learnt about the back story of the movie, the most curious thing was who will play Enzo Ferrari. Although I was slightly disappointed with his characterization, I cannot find any other negatives about this movie. From start to finish, the story flows naturally with the two leads and the support cast (who were brilliant)."
Great true story. Great acting from all concerned. Great direction. Highly recommend you go see this on the big screen! I will be happy to pay to see movies in theatres if they are of this quality. Well done all concerned! The only reason I didnt give this a 10 out of 10 is because I associate 10s as being from studio shills etc rather than fans and disregard them as a matter of course. Same as I disregard 1s and 2s as a rule. Do yourself a favour and go see this movie on the big screen.
"In the era of EVs with the fancy names like Roadster or Cybertruck, it's like looking back at the dinosaur age of cars! A bit of overacting was there, but the movie making was fantastic. A classic Hollywood novel."
A wonderful movie! Well written and beautifully acted! Damon and Bale are spectacular! I laughed. I cried. I got angry. I was on the edge of my seat! Be ready to experience a rollercoaster of emotions when you see this film. Wow!
I enjoyed this movie. I just couldn't help but feel like it was more of advertisement for Ford than it was a movie. but really cool action scenes
"Matt Damon and Christian Bale are two of the best actors of our generation. Former is car designer whiz Carroll Shelby and Latter is WWII English Driver Ken MilesShelby is the brain and Miles the brawn. Ferrari keeps beating Ford in races and money. And need to find a driver along with keeping Ford in business and not sending thousands out of work.Miles may be a likable jerk but loves his wife and son and would do anything for them despite his car shop closing down over taxes and poor people skills. Also that is when Shelby comes on in as he has better people skills.Despite Ken's faults, Carroll offers Miles the chance to drive the car and save his family's making ends meet and Ford despite big wigs jumping down their throats.Great supporting cast also by Josh Lucas as a jerk auto exec while Jon Bernthal is the sympathetic exec to save Ford. It will get some Oscar nods. But really think Bale and Damon are two of the greatest actors of our generation.It will have a bittersweet ending for sure. Won't spoil it for ya."
"I simply love this movie, what a great story to be told and Matt Damon and Christian Bale are magnificent in their respective roles as Shelby and Miles. It's one of the greatest moments in racing history and I'm happy it could be shared in this fashion."
"As is the soundtrack.
I'm so not a petrol head, but this was great entertainment."
The movie is really good. The actors christian and matt did a great job together. I liked the way ken miles reacted to people for being different and although it did him pain you could see he really cared about everything and was so positive even when he got up by losing le mans. I loved how quickly he moved on. Such a charismatic human he was. But the ending was so sad. Didnt see that coming. I wished that wasnt filmed.
"James Mangold directs as Tracy Letts, playing rich dickhead Henry Ford II in Le Mans '66, (Ford v Ferrari), throws a spanner in the works, and tells his staff to come up with an answer to falling sales, or walk. And Jon Bernthal's Lee Iacocca puts his wheel nuts on the line, and tells Ford that no one aspires to buy a Ford. James Bond, (that degenerate), does not drive a Ford! Hell they all want Ferraris. Because they are thoroughbred sports cars winning the Le Mans 24 hour race. And Henry, thank god for Lee, actually thinks it's a good idea. So armed with a cheque book and pen, Lee flies to Italy to make Ferrari an offer. Maybe Remo Girone's Enzo played them, because he accepts another inflated Fiat offer. Not sure if it was already on the table, it would appear not. But with Ferrari in play Fiat took a swipe. And by the way Henry Ford is a fat pig Enzo tells Lee, as a parting shot. Who then repeats what he said to Henry. Rightly pissed Henry decides that Ford Motor Cars are going to build their own sports cars. And beat Ferrari at their own endurance race game.But how? Well with Matt Damon's Carroll Shelby for a start. And the winner of the 1959 Le Mans has form. Retired due to a heart problem, in 1966 he's now building AC Cobras. Such a beautiful car. But to build a car to take on Ferrari is a different animal. And needs a pure racer, in the form of mouthy mechanic Christian Bale's Ken Miles, who's looking for the perfect lap. A wrench may be the sum of their abiding brotherly love for each other.I cannot say I'm a fan of motor-racing, but Le Mans '66 had me on the edge of my seat, with definitely no drag in the 150 minute run time. But Ken Miles was not Ford's first choice of driver for their new GT40. Josh Lucas is the nasty Leo Beebe, soon to be Ford Racing Director, and determined to keep him off the team. He and Ken get off to a bad start with the unveiling of the new Ford Mustang. And Ken does have the sort of temperament to say anything on camera. That makes the Ford suits a little uneasy! But you have to love Christian Bales's bluntness. I feel sure this is another Oscar worthy performance from Bale, among a very talented cast. And he spars well with wife Mollie, played by Catriona Balfe, and Noah Jupe is his adoring son. But Ken has to drive because it's in his blood. Fuelled by British tea. And he has the courage to drive a car at 218mph in the Le Mans Mulsanne Straight. The GT40's top speed, as Ferrari looked on. Let's just hope the car can hold it together, with a throaty engine shoehorned in. And pray the brakes don't give out. As Shelby says, at 7,000 revs man becomes machine, and James Mangold makes you feel every one of them.But Ford's entry into Le Mans was not without disaster. And when Henry Ford II is idling in the slow lane on the track with Shelby one day, he puts his money where his mouth is. And through the tears, tells Shelby to go to war. The driving seat is now 48 year old former tank driver Ken's to lose. But first he has to win the 24 Hour Daytona.I cannot pretend to know much about the technology of the car, but I thought Ray McKinnon's Phil Remington adding go faster strips was great fun. They were really for the aerodynamics of the car! But what a rocket blast. Behind the scenes below explains better with Christian Bale.With cinematography by Phedon Papamichael, amazing photography and a cracking storyline, James Mangold proves that a driving based film can have massive appeal to all. A terrific job."
"I just got out of Le Mans '66 (Ford V Ferrari)I'll admit, right off, I do not like racing movies for two reasons 1, I have no interest in motor racing and 2, the movies always have the same problem, boredom (the cars go round and round) and predictability (the hero wins) but i'd heard good things about this one and it's James Mangold (Copland, Logan, Walk The Line) so I went to see it.First off, it is not really about the company of Ford versus the company of Ferrari, maybe that's why it is called Le Mans '66 in the UK. Carol Shelby (Damon) is hired to create a car to win Le Mans '66 by Ford, he insists on having Ken Miles (Bale) help him and be the driver. The suits at Ford do not want Miles driving and attempt to drop or undermine him every chance they get, as Shelby and Mild try to design said car in 90 days en route to Le Man's '66. So really it's Shelby & Miles versus the suits of Ford, whilst Ford wants to beat Ferrari.I loved the performances, Bale and Damon are both great, Bale just steals every scene, he is the heart of the movie, you root for him, he is the underdog, because Ford don't want him as the face of the company!! You never root for Ford, truthfully, I never cared about the Ford V Ferrari thing at all. I just wanted Bale and Damon to succeed. Despite being nasty to the Americans at the beginning, at least Enzo Ferrari cared about what he was doing and the sport of motor racing and he had some honour. Henry Ford didn't care about the car or the sport. He just wanted to turn around decking sales and was mad at Ferrari over an insult.I think I enjoyed it so much as it didn't really focus on the racing aspect, if you are expecting a racing movie, you will be disappointed. It focused more on the making of the car and the various relationships. You don't need to know about racing to enjoy this movie, it's about the characters.Everyone knocks it out of the park!! Not just the main actors the supporting actors too, Josh Lucas is in this and of course he is a d*ck, isn't he always!! I mean I really hated him, I couldn't wait to see him get knocked out!! Ray McKinnon is great too, every time he was on screen, I was trying to place him, an IMDB search reveals he was Bradley in A Perfect World.If I had one complaint, and it's only minor it's Jon Bernthal, he is great, it is his idea for Ford to enter the world of racing, he chose and is Damon's biggest supporter and then he just disappears or is relegated to the background or if he is in shot not speaking , he is an important part of the first half of the movie then he doesn't speak for the second!!Top 5 movie of the year for me."
Ford V Ferrari staring Christian Bale and Matt Damon is a must see movie for everyone. This film had me on the edge of my seat the whole time.
With so many great performances by big names I think particular recognition for Tracy Letts is much deserved. That test drive scene was something else.
One of the best movies in this year. Oscar please!
"Most people are attending - or staying away from - the new James Mangold film, FORD v FERRARI because it is a ""race car flick"". But to label it as just that is doing a disservice to this film, so if that is what is keeping you away from this movie, think again, for this film is much more than a race car film.It is, at it's core, a film about friendship and loyalty in the face of adversity and is a very serious contender for multiple awards this Oscar season.A long gestating film project (Director Mangold first came across this property in 2010), FORD v FERRARI tells the tale of the Ford Motor Company's attempt to unseat the Italian car company, Ferrari, as an elite race car producer by defeating it on it's own turf - the 24 hour race at LeMans.Entrusted to make this dream a reality by Henry Ford II (Tracy Letts) is (now) legendary race car designer Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) who turns to his reckless friend - and top race car driver - Ken Miles (Christian Bale) to help put this project over the top.Will this duo succeed? Will Ford topple Ferrari? Can Shelby help smooth the rough waters that the temperamental Miles will, inevitably, create? What do you think?But it is the journey - and not the destination - that is the joy of this film, for under the watchful, steady eye of veteran Director Mangold (WALK THE LINE) this film is much, much more than the cliched journey of a maverick bucking the system to, ultimately, prevail. It is a study of friendship and loyalty under intense pressure and Mangold finds the right balance between showing hardcore racing and the friendship and camaraderie of Miles and Shelby.Mangold, of course, smartly knew that the success (or failure) of this film will rest on the chemistry between the two leads of this film - and he cast them well. Matt Damon brings his usual charm and easy-going attitude to Carroll Shelby, making him the heart and anchor of this film - we see the events unfold through his eyes - and he is a an easy stand-in for the audience during the proceedings and is someone that we are happy, and comfortable, to spend the 2 1/2 hours of this film with.This is good, for he is strongly complimented - and challenged - by the hard intensity that Christian Bale brings to his portrayal of Ken Miles. This real-life racing car legend is driven (pun intended) to excellence, and does not suffer fools gladly. We spend a good amount of time in this film with Miles staring intently out the window of his race car and no one does smoldering, staring intensity better than Bale. This is another Oscar-worthy performance by an actor who has made a career of Oscar-worthy performances and has me asking - is he the finest actor working today? He certainly is in the conversation.Bale and Damon play off each other very well, their chemistry seems real and we believe that these are 2 old friends working together. This is the first pairing of these two, and based on these results, I would guess that we'll be seeing these two in a film together again.They are joined by strong supporting work by the likes of Letts, Jon Bernthal (portraying Lee Iacocca) and Caitriona Balfe (as Miles wife, Mollie). Only Josh Lucas (as the a-hole antagonist of the film) fares less well as his character is written in one note and Lucas just plays that note.The racing scenes are well done - giving us the visceral intensity of what it must be like in the car, and in the pits, of a major race experience. But it is the friendship between Miles and Shelby that really is the engine that drives this film.Letter Grade: A9 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank (ofMarquis)"
"Ford v Ferrari tells the incredible true story set in the 1960s, the movie follows the renowned ex racer, Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon), a short tempered and mildly arrogant but extremely talented driver Ken Miles (Christian Bale) as they attempt to beat the Ferrari, the fastest car at the time with a Ford in the famous 24 hours of Le Mans.Arguably one of the most talented directors working today, James Mangold is a steady hand at the helm of this two-and-a-half-hour experience. The film's brilliance is however not the result of any single cog working to perfection but every moving part working in tandem to build a flawless machine. The direction, the editing, the performances, the score, the production design, Ford v Ferrari very literally fires on all cylinders.With a film centred on race cars and the thrill of 7000 RPM, turning the film into an unofficial Fast and Furious sequel is an unfortunate possibility. Mangold however sought something deeper than the action with this film, something more profound. At its heart Ford v Ferrari is about character and a powerful friendship. Ken Miles is a brash, often rude driver and car mechanic, a man whose real home is behind the wheel or under the hood. Shelby is a man haunted by his days of glory yet determined to push his cars across the finish line. Meanwhile the Ford Motor Company desperately searches for a revival in business, they eventually find hope for their company on the racetrack, challenging the mighty Ferrari in the 24 hours of Le Mans. Shelby, the only American who has ever won the Le Mans and Miles, the only driver who could give Ford a fighting chance tirelessly begin their work building the ultimate speed machine. The real story in this journey is the friendship between these two men and the tireless pursuit for excellence.Christian Bale once again disappears into his character, after portraying Dick Cheney in Vice, Ken Miles is a starkly different character especially physically and yet again Bale pulls off an incredible physical transformation proving once again his unbelievable commitment to his craft. Miles goes through perhaps the most elaborate emotional arcs of any character in the film, a passion for cars, a family to support, and an intolerance for the polished self-importance of big corporations. Bale conveys the sophistication of this character with ease, he becomes Miles enchanting the audience with a brash charm delivering a performance that is nothing short of Oscar worthy.Carroll Shelby is perhaps the one man who really understands Miles, the only man who sees the real brilliance of Miles and perhaps the only true friend Mile has. Damon gives this performance the force it deserves portraying a great American car manufacturer who believed in excellence and who truly understood what it took to carry home a Le Mans victory. Shelby is the audience's character, we see experience the film in his shoes, we understand the difficulty of the decisions he is forced to make, we feel the victories, the defeats and the pain with Shelby and Matt Damon brings that emotional range to his performance which again is worthy of the highest honours.When the film does hit the racetrack, when the audience is put behind the wheel, the film reveals a whole new adrenaline rush. The races are jaw droppingly brilliant. The film gives the car fanatics exactly what they want and more, the growl of the engines, the burning rubber, the screeching metal, the thrill of the race, it's all dialled to eleven. The sequences are masterfully shot, the camera is low and tight, interiors are close to the driver, we feel their heart pound as they knock the car into fifth gear, the exteriors shots are close to the ground, we see the sparks and rubble fly, we feel the heat. The grit and danger of a race is perfectly portrayed, nothing is predictable, no one is safe. Mangold creates a claustrophobic, tense yet realistic portrayal of a race giving the audience some of the greatest race sequences perhaps of all time.Ford v Ferrari is one of 2019's most entertaining experiences while telling a compelling and emotional story at the same time. There is not a moment the film takes its foot of the gas, no missed opportunities, no weak performances, no broken moments. The film is clear contender for the best of the year and is certainly worthy of the title, not only is it a cut above most of the year's filmography but it will likely stand the test of time to cement a place in Hollywood's finest moments. In a powerful moment with his son Ken Miles says, Out there is the perfect lap. You see it? As far as movies go, Ford v Ferrari is the perfect lap."
"Finally a good movie in the last many many many years. Great camera, great actors, great scenes, great dialogues, and incredible chemistry all around. Damon is great as per usual, Bale carried it our fantastically. Warm, sad, brilliant, passionate movie. Just go and watch, no need to review it."
Shows fast and furious how race movies can have some quality as well.
"FORD v FERRARI
RATING: 4.9/5Yeah, Ford v Ferrari is definitely my favorite movie of the year. It's been years since i felt like i was watching actual movie stars on the big screen. It was great to have that feeling in the theater again, thanks to Christian Bale and Matt Damon. Same goes for the supporting actors. There were no phoned in performances, everyone showed up to play, even the kid. Not to mention, the 2 1/2 hour run time just flies by, as the film jumps from situation to situation. The story is tight. No subplots, no fat to really trim. This movie knows exactly where it's going and the road it needs to take to get there. No detours, probably because it's based off the true story of when Ford beat the dominant Ferrari at the prestigious 24 hour Le Mans race back in 1966. The movie is actually called ""Le Mans '66"" in some countries. It's considered the Super Bowl of racing, for many race enthusiasts.Anyways, the film takes place in the 60s but it feels very modern because they spend all their time either racing or working on cars, giving it almost a timeless quality. I was iffy on the musical score but after watching the movie twice, i noticed the score would get me anxious during the race scenes (4DX is the preferred way to watch this movie). My leg would start shaking and I'd get this feeling that i had to go fast. As someone that likes driving fast, that's pretty impressive, so the score definitely does a great job of immersing you in these races, and not overpowering the scenes. Cinematography is spot on. There's a moment where they're racing at night, in the rain, and it just made me super anxious. If you've ever driven in hard rain before, going 60 mph or more, you should be able to grasp the concept of how dangerous it is going over 150 mph, with other cars trying to pass you. This is a great looking movie.I'm really struggling to find negative things to say about this movie, so I'm going to address some of the negative things I've heard in reviews I've seen.
TOO MANY WHITE PEOPLE:Yes, the movie is filled with white men, and one white woman, so there's not a lot of diversity here, if that's what you're looking for. Remember, it's based off a true story that takes place in the 60s, ""Mad Men"" era. Knocking a movie for trying to be accurate to reality is just not smart at all.
NO CHARACTER GROWTH:Someone said there was no real character growth in the movie. In the final race, a big thing happens for one of the characters, that practically took a lifetime of growth as a person for them to accomplish. It's even acknowledged by other characters in the movie. It's just nonsense to say there was no character development.
-????:
One reviewer was hoping to see the engine built from the ground up and was disappointed that's not what they got in the film. I mean, the story being told wasn't about the car being built from scratch. The Ford Racing program already existed before Ford ever decided to take on Ferrari. This was about Ken Miles and Carol Shelby being brought on board to do the impossible with what was already there at Ford. This reviewer wanted a different movie.
CLIMATE CHANGE:Yeah, that reviewer was full of it. LOLUltimately, even if someone is not into racing, i think the concepts in the movie are extremely accessible. There are so many themes going through this movie, you're bound to find one that you can get behind. The story of man and machine, creators v. big business, innovation against time, being the best versus being a team player, etc... there's a lot of commentary going on just beneath the surface. The movie is a great snapshot of the American Spirit. It takes place around the time America landed on the moon. Around the time when American exceptionalism was arguably at its height. The Ford GT40 is practically a representation of the American Spirit, America potential. The impossible made real. It's magic, and so is this movie.SIDE NOTE:
Ford decided to go back to Le Mans in 2016, for the 50th anniversary of the Ford GT40 win in 1966, and they won! Like i said, that car, that racing program, is simply magic."
Since I had just visited the Henry Ford Museum I decided to check this out even though I knew very little about racing. It was phenomenal. Everyone in the cast is just perfect and the soundtrack will get your heart pumping. I'd love to see it as an Oscar contender.
"As all of the true masterpieces, Ford v Ferrari isn't only about the race, rather more compelling challenge of the life. Where individualism comes to question should we rethink our values on collectivism? What makes the perfect connection between you and family and how true are our friendships are the questions that the movie challenges it's viewers. Funny yet thrilling story dramatized in the most perfect way possible. It doesn't matter if one outpowers the other, what matters is to win the race of life!"
"Just a brief review on what is ultimately a terrific mostly family-friendly adrenaline blockbuster.I've always felt that giving movies a number ratings is always hit or miss. How does a number quantify the enjoyment or the quality inherent in a film? I'm sure I do not know. That being said. This movie is a delight from beginning to end. Its fleet 2 hour and 32 minute run time is hardly felt as we zoom from scene to scene documenting the trials that Carol Shelby (Matt Damon) and Ken Miles (Christian Bale) must go through so that they can take Ford to the 24 Hours at Le Mans in 1966 to win against Ferrari who has won it 3 straight times. First and foremost are the characters. The supporting cast with Jon Bernthal and Tracy Letts for example are all terrific, giving well acted and very well written performances that give each character a purpose and something to do that accentuates the challenges that the two lead characters have to face. Damon and Bale are both at the top of their game here giving some of their best performances in years, especially Damon. And it works as well as it does because they and the film remember that a film like this needs to have fun and they're enjoying themselves immensely. Cracking clever jokes and snarky one liners that would make a marvel movie blush. Its terrific. The score and cinematography are first rate as well but it all comes together with the direction of James Mangold who yet again proves himself a valuable asset to american cinema with his steady focus on character and action that helped make his previous film ""Logan"" equally as compelling.
The final sequence of the film is not only tense what it needs to be but one of the the most important parts about film, its ultimately transportive. You feel as if you are there in frnace alongside these racers, ready to make history. Its expertly edited and with the help of terrific sound design that let you hear the roar of the cars and the individuals aspects of the elements like rain and wind, the film fully encapsulates what movies do best: Pure Escapism.This is a film for the whole family to see and enjoy. It's a film not just for car lovers but a wonderful experience to share because the film takes such care with showing the benefits and Joy's of working together for a common goal that will only bring about innovation and technological and personal prosperity. It's a treat and a great american movie! Go and see it!"
"Didn't watch any trailer or didn't know anything about the movie. Considering the title I first thought Matt Damon and Cristian Bale would be representing Ford and Ferrari respectively or vice versa.Enjoyed the movie from the start to end. Brilliantly written and directed. Loved the dialogues about about the 7000 RPM. Brilliant cast who obviously act great. Loved the sound design of the engines, brakes and tires screeching at the curves.A brilliant movie, would suggest not to miss watching in a theatre. I guarantee you would love the movie even if you are not a Motorhead."
The premise of the film is quite obvious. But the story is very interesting and it was both entertaining and inspiring. It's worth watching at the cinema the sound is captivating.Overall great film.
"Cool cars, great acting, artistic direction, excellent cinematography and thrilling car races. All packed into a well-written character drama about the man's never ending quest for perfection, friendship, team-effort and corporate greed."
"This is the best movie of the year thus far. Best movie on cars and racing. Brilliant script brilliantly done by brilliant performances of cast and crew. Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Supporting Actor, Best Director, Best Editing nominations for sure."
"Incredible. Oscar worthy. The best movie on automobile competition with intense racing sequences and heart throbbing soundtracks. And last but not the least, incredible acting. 10 out of 10"
"I had huge expectations for ""Ford v Ferrari"" and the movie didn't disappoint at all! Amazing Christian Bale - he is again doing perfect job portraying a very interesting character. Life and work of racing drivers are usually really complicated and every big champion needs to tackle different issues in their private or professional life. The movie managed to tell us a complete and heartbreaking story that involved conflicts on different levels. Miles (Christian Bale) and Shelby (Matt Damon) against the interests of Leo Beebe (Josh Lucas), Ford vs Ferrari, the expectations of Henry Ford II, the feeling of being a great racing driver but also a great role model for your son. Honestly, Bale deserves an Oscar for this performance and I am really looking forward to the Oscars next year, because 2019 offered some of the best movies in the history of cinema."
"Just back from Cinema and I'm soo Glad I experienced this Full on ""Pedal to the Metal"" movie masterclass on the Big Screen...An absolute gem of a film. Hat's off to Christian Bale (again) and Matt Damon.. Totally engaged emotionally with their story characters and their relationship.. I genuinely cant recommend this enough.. Jump in and enjoy the ride.."
"Absolutely brilliant film, it is long but didn't feel it when I was watching. It has been a long time since I've really felt drawn in and immersed in a film. I could easily go see this again."
"This is not just the usually sportcar movie. It's about do what you most passionate with in life and in this case it's about Cars.
This film has a message, don't let the more powerful people let you down and do what you heart beats for!"
"Got to admit that this film was one of my personal most anticipated films of the year. The story itself which I only knew very few details about sounded really interesting, a David vs Goliath type of story. James Mangold's name was also a major attraction to the film, a seasoned film maker with some really good films. However the biggest draw of all was the cast and in particular Christian Bale...........who I will admit is my favourite actor of all time...............and oh yeah Matt Damon isn't bad too!I'm gonna be completely honest straight up I strangely didn't like this film as much as I thought I was going to..............maybe my expectations were too high?? However I am in some way surprise with how the film turned out, its a much more character driven film than I thought it was going to be!!! Le Mans only takes up the last 45-30 mins of the film which is not a lot, but I don't think that is a criticism at all.James Mangold has made as good as looking a film as I thought he would, from start to finish it is beautiful to watch. He manages to really immerse you in the time period almost straight away and makes you buy into the characters right from the get go. The film does show that Mangold really did do his research, the amount of care and attention the detail really shines through in the races. The more impressive part of the film is the good balance between the fast paced racing and the more slow character driven parts of the film, both of which complement each other really nicely. The tension in the race scenes really works because they are built upon really good character development and also development of their relationships, which is best shown between Bale and Damon. You care about them.Bale and Damon are both fantastic actors in my opinion so it is no surprise that they are really really good in the film.........Oscar worthy I'm not so sure but did it need to be.........No. Their on screen chemistry really shows that the actors must have had fun on set because they seem to have a really good connection during the film, its like watching two friends. Other shoutouts Tracey Letts, Jon Bernthal and Josh Lucas all really strong performances. I think the best part is the pit crew and the close relationship they have with Bale and Damon is a real gem of the film.The action scenes are brilliantly choreographed and simply put you in the drivers seat, some real nail biting racing that is a pure joy to watch. Considering that I didn't know how the story was going to end it really was..........heart pounding!!The film for me almost got an 8 out of 10 because the ending has such emotional punch, which is extremely effective. The fact that Miles didn't win the race and the death of Ken Miles so it was a complete surprise to me when they happened................the film handled the death really well and actually the final scene was a really nice close to the film. However the only thing stopping me from giving it an 8 is the re-watchabilty of the film, for some strange reason I don't see myself itching to watch it again straight away.........maybe its because its a long film and it is a slow paced film for the most part.Overall even though I didn't enjoy it as much as I thought I would, its still a really good film 75% out of 100, its almost at 80% but not quite. Definitely recommend it just for the story of Shelby and Miles even if you don't like racing or cars..........this is a much more character driven film than you'd think!"
"When you see this movie, do not expect it to be high octane action or a fast and furious movie. This is about making history. Just being part of the journey. Seeing their passion about the car, speed, the feeling of it. Matt Damon And Christian Bale puts on their best performance. This is a slow burn of a movie. Learning about what works and what does not. They face challenges, setbacks, and problems. This movie is living the dream and fighting to get it. The problem of this movie, it has certain scenes where it can be cut short. Also sometimes I hear a lot of mumbling. I can't hear their words clearly. I don't know, maybe it's me. The point I am making is, it's great but I don't know if I want to watch it again. I probably forget about it in a couple days. Because it's not memorable. You may disagree. But that's my opinion."
"Great storyline, Bale deserves an Oscar for this! Chemistry between Bale & Damon is out of this world. A worthy competetor for Rush!"
"It is the 1960s, Ferrari is reigning as king of race cars, while Ford has gained a reputation for mass production of uniform road machines. When a buyout goes sour, the biggest grudge match, or the longest, is about to catch the world by surprise.As someone unaware of the dramatics of the racing world, I hesitated about going into the cinema for it. Ford v. Ferrari already sounds like a pissing contest between corporates. Well, it definitely is something of that nature, except the backstory and the act itself proves to be much more thrilling than you'd imagine. The amount of 1960s corporate suits didn't bother me at all. The cast is stellar, without a doubt, Matt Damon is so incredibly in control of his talent, capable of convincing the audience he IS Carroll Shelby, even if Damon himself is not a car guy at all. This says much about how good the screenplay is, based on a book of all real events. Christian Bale is as usual, on a ride with his A-game. The distinct mannerism of the racing Hall of Famer Ken Miles is immortalized through Bale's careful craft, borne of his unshakable dedication to the art of cinema. In fact, the whole cast shines so brightly through the movie, from Josh Lucas, Jon Bernthal to Outlander's Caitriona Balfe, each woven into the main narrative in an organic yet unneglectable way without much drag or distraction. Also, using all real racing cars instead of SFX for the important car racing scenes definitely pays off on the big screen. The camera angles are brilliant in capture those 200 million-dollar cars in motion. As a girl, I love the racing segments!More than just a car movie, the 2.5 hours boasts with comedy, thrills, and dramatic revelations that in the end, all make sense during the climax. To me, there wasn't a moment wasted, and my second viewing became even more entertaining, ripe with ""a-ha"" moments. I am definitely gonna pick up the book it's based on, Go Like Hell by A. J. Baime. Can I also just note how wonderful the soundtracks are? Without a doubt, the engine sound is probably more center-stage in the film, making the just-right amount of epic score and songs much appreciable along the way."
"A cracking good film made in as close a style to old-school Hollywood (back when they made good films consistently) as you can possibly get.It's got good old-school messages about sons and fathers and what it means as an artist to fight against the corporate mindset, and WIN. And this film is a WINNER through and through - all the way to the checkered flag.Long after the roar of high octane carburetor mixed engines and the scream of burning rubber and brake gaskets leaves you, you'll be left with a film that took you on a journey through the absolute best of the American dream.And a film that deals with both the lows of poignant loss and the highs of incandescent heroism.Nothing will ever diminish this film, it is timeless."
"Bales got a strong English accent and his boil on his eyeball has gotten considerably large, but he's solid as all hell along with Damon. Fast cars. Worth the watch."
"Just go and watch. All things will justify themselves. Characters, direction etc placed perfect."
"Amazing story, vivid, you cannot stop watching until the very end!"
"Christian Bale and Matt Damon co-star in this vigorously-executed depiction of Ford Motor Company's full-on attempt to compete with Ferrari in the 24-hour race in Le Mans in 1966. This race is expertly recaptured in some of the most well-executed race car scenes in history. Along with exceptional period detail, there is also a riveting soundtrack to help the pacing.Bale gives a feral performance as Ken Miles, the combustible British race car driver who test-drove and helped develop the first Ford vehicle that could go head-to-head with Ferrari in Le Mans. Matt Damon gives a down-to-earth performance as Carroll Shelby, the retired race car driver who worked together with Miles and Ford on the groundbreaking race car. Tracy Letts is an authoritative presence as Henry Ford II, who was initially reluctant to get involved in the race car enterprise but eventually saw a new opening for the automaking giant.The film's narrative is guided by the sure hand of James Mangold's direction. Although the film proceeds initially at a deliberate pace, you gradually become invested and develop a firm rooting interest. Bale and Damon play well off each other and become a heroic duo fighting for both American interests abroad and against corporate chicanery within the Ford Motor Company. All in all, the film will take your breath away. It is proof that sometimes good old-fashioned storytelling aided by strong performances are all you need. Enthusiastically recommended."
"Top notch performances by Matt Damon and Christian Bale. This movie is very entertaining from beginning to end. Lets be real Christian Bale stole the show and has become one of my favorite actors. Don't miss out watching this in the theatre, you won't be disappointed."
This is a real rollercoaster of a film. There's lots of tension that builds to a awesome climax and a touching ending. Ford Corporation really comes off looking like an awful place to work. Every executive is drawn to look like an arrogant cutthroat. Only Iacocca is spared. Ferrari was shown to be the company with true dignity and vision. I loved the movie and can't wait to see it again.
"Ford V Ferrari is about Ford wanting to win the le moz race. To do this they hire some of the best in the business, but to win the race they go through many problems.Since I found out about this film over the summer, I have been really looking forward to it. I couldn't contain my self since the first trailer came out. It is a movie with Christian Bale and Matt Damon. When I walked out of the theatre was happy with what I got. It wasn't a perfect film, but I still was happy and enjoyed my time in the theatre. The acting was the best part of the film. You obviously know that a film with Matt Damon AND Christian Bale is going to be really good. Those two are a great pair and should work with each other in many more movies.
The cinematography was surprisingly good. They had some tough tasks and they executed them really well. The race scene were spectacular. James Mangold nailed these scenes. The last two races were real nail biters. They got your heart pounding for the whole time. In the last race James Mangold decided to put some comedic relief. I am glad he did that because my heart would have came out of my chest if he didn't! The only flaw I saw with the film was the first act. It felt like it could have been made better. It dragged a little bit and it just wasn't as solid as the rest of the movie. It wasn't terrible it just couldn't hold up from how good the rest of the movie was.Overall, Ford V Ferrari was a great film I would recommend in theaters for sure."
"The movie is really good overall. The sound and music were well put together, and the effects looked perfect. Without a doubt this is one of the best racing movies in my opinion."
"Easily one of the best films this year. Heart beating, nail biting leaving you on edge of the seat. Christian Bale gives an Oscar Performance. A Must See...!"
It's a story about two people and two star companies in automobiles. How life is full of ups and downs have shown in movie a great way. Some shots will give real adrenaline rush. Totally worth watching.
"Great movie, very entertaining, would have scored a 10 if some things weren't changed in the true story."
"Great movie, amazing acting from Matt Damon and Christian Bale. Cars and racing scenes were amazing. One of the best movies of this year."
"I mean it's great and all, but i found myself rooting for ferrari most of the time.
Doesn't help that the ferrari 330 is probably the best looking car ever made."
"Honestly, I went to watch this movie with no expectations, and I regret nothing. It was totally worth it. Brilliant storytelling, beautifully shot, masterfully acted, and surprisingly emotional. Christian Bale and Matt Damon delivered an outstanding performance. Although I don't know anything about cars or didn't know much about the real story, I absolutely enjoyed this movie."
"The first part of the movie was a little slow and kinda boring but the second part plus the last part was incredibly exciting I was thrilled with the racing scenes like I was part of it, now let's talk about Christian Bale what a performance he is the star of the movie.
overall great story to be told and played well done."
"It is a well crafted movie with every scene and actor well chosen. Christian Bale and Matt Damon were amazing. The movie takes you a part of Carroll Shelby and Ken Miles's life and how their combined passion, ambition, determination and dedication lead them to a success which everyone thought impossible. It's the kind of movie you can watch again and again."
"Absolutely excellent film : Ford vs Ferrari, with Matt Damon as car designer Carroll Shelby(Oscar exemplary role) and Christian Bale as British driver Ken Miles(perfectly cast).Well done although I thought Caitriona Balfe as Miles's wife and related story was unnecessary and interrupted the tight screenplay.John Bernthal was amazing as Lee Iacocca (who in real life saved Chrysler and who passed away four months before the film was completed). Tracy Letts as Henry Ford II was also great as was Remo Girone in the role of Enzo Ferrari.It may be called Le Mans '65 in your country but the film is really all about Ford and Ferrari.Of course special effects abound (one has to recreate the 1960's - my favorite decade) as with most modern Hollywood films (although Infernum, my latest film has no special effects and still makes the point across using excellent location shooting).The Le Mans scenes were filmed in different places and seamlessly edited together so the viewer sees just one location.Finally, I wonder why didn't they use Mclaren as the driver working with Shelby instead of Miles, as he ended up creating his own super car company and probably has a more interesting story to tell than Ken Miles. who knows, it may become Ford v Ferrari, the sequel."
"Great movie with a top notch performance by Christian Bale and Matt Damon, a fun ride with some very well shot an directed race sequences. It follows the true story of the Ford company expanding themselves financially and Bale's character training to win the 1966 Le Man's cup. It does run for quite a while. 2 and a half hours but it rarely drags and is entertaining and heartfelt the whole way through. Also a pretty funny movie to with a bit of comedy sprinked here and there but definitely has it's serious moments too.The movie is definitely a period piece and the movie nails it for the time period it is set in. It's some really well though out production design and visual choices for the atmosphere of this movie. Some very nice car models are put to good use in the movie which are very appealing to the eye. Overall a very well made movie about the competition between two monumental car companies and the tale of a man with his passion for racing"
Loved it. Outstanding performance. You can feel the engines. Simply wow!!
"I love the story, the cinematic experience, the assemble casts."
Hands down the best movie of the year enjoyed every single bit of it. I might even buy tuna on iTunes when it come out.
"I really enjoyed the movie. The racing scenes are awesome and exhilarating. The Ken Miles scenes are funny and enjoyable. I felt sad when he died in the end. The fistfight between Shelby and Miles made me laugh out loud in the theater. I heard some other laughs in the audience. I'm surprised that I understood it, since I don't know much about Le Mans (I'm an F1 mega fan). The scenes with Mollie and Peter are also nice. I especially enjoyed it because I watched it with my dad (another motorsport fan). The jokes are also enjoyable, even if they aren't meant to be jokes. Matt Damon and Christian Bale acted well. My favorite scenes were the ones where after Miles drove a car, he'd go into some mega explaining mode about how the car needs to be improved. He'd say things like ""Oh, the steering is too loose,"" or ""The engine needs to be bigger,"" or ""The car is way too damn heavy!"" Those made me laugh a lot. I recommend this to anyone 13 and up. Really cool. Loved it."
No flaws. Everything is perfect. I would watching it again and again
"Love the chemistry between bale and damon, only thing that could of done better was bales dodgy British accent"
"In America this movie is titled Ford vs. Ferrari, that is essentially the big hook of the film, but film critic Mark Kermode said in his review that this is very similar to Rush, in that the characters come first, and the cars come second (or some people say the other way around). From the trailer I saw I was definitely going to watch it at the cinema, directed by James Mangold (Walk the Line, Knight and Day, Logan). Basically, in1963, Ford Motor Company Vice President Lee Iacocca (Jon Bernthal) proposes to Henry Ford II (Tracy Letts) to purchase the cash-strapped Ferrari in order to boost their car sales by participating in the 24 Hours of Le Mans. However, Enzo Ferrari (Remo Girone) walks away from the deal, after Fiat offer a more lucrative deal that allows him to retain his ownership of Scuderia Ferrari. Henry II is furious and orders his racing division to build a car to defeat Ferrari at Le Mans. For this task, Iacocca hires Shelby American owner and retired racing driver Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon), he won Le Mans in 1959, he was forced to stop due to his heart condition. In turn, Shelby enlists the help of Ken Miles (Christian Bale), a hot-tempered British racer and struggling mechanic. Shelby and Miles test the Ford GT40 Mk I prototype at Los Angeles International Airport, finding all its design flaws and making the necessary improvements until it is ready to race. Ford do not see Miles as their ideal driver, due to his abrasive attitude, they opt to send Phil Hill (James Tyler Paulson) and Bruce McLaren (Benjamin Rigby) to the 1964 Le Mans instead. As predicted by Miles, none of the Ford vehicles finish the race. While Henry II sees this as a humiliating defeat, Shelby explains that the GT40 reached higher speeds than Ferrari, instilling fear in them on the Mulsanne straight, before it broke down. Shelby and Miles continue development on the GT40 Mk II, but Miles is nearly killed when the car's brakes fail during testing. In 1966, Ford Senior Vice President Leo Beebe (Josh Lucas) takes over the racing division and intends again to continue the program without Miles. But Shelby gives Henry II a ride in the car and wages his own company on the line to convince him that if Miles wins the 24 Hours of Daytona, he will be allowed to race at Le Mans. Shelby American enters Daytona, but Beebe has a second Ford entered with NASCAR team Holman-Moody supporting it. While the Holman-Moody team has quicker pit stops, Shelby has Miles push his car to the limit, resulting in him winning the race. At the 1966 Le Mans, Miles struggles with a faulty door during the first lap, team engineer Phil Remington (Ray McKinnon) fixes the door, bashing it with a mallet. Miles catches up with the Ferraris and begins to set lap records. His wife Mollie (Caitriona Balfe) and son Peter (A Quiet Place's Noah Jupe) watch and listen to the action as it unfolds.
Miles. While racing with Ferrari driver Lorenzo Bandini (Francesco Bauco), Miles experiences another brake failure, but the system is replaced during his pit stop. Enzo Ferrari protests the move, but Shelby convinces the race officials that the brake change is legal. Miles and Bandini once again duel on the Mulsanne Straight, but Bandini's engine blows, and Ferrari are completely eliminated from the race. With three Ford teams in the top-three positions, Beebe orders Shelby to have Miles slow down for the other two Fords to catch up with him and provide the press with a three-car photo finish. Miles is initially against this decision, continuing to set new lap records near the end of the race, but decides to let Ford have their way on the final lap. Ultimately, McLaren is declared the winner on a technicality, but Miles is grateful to Shelby for giving him the opportunity to race at Le Mans. Ultimately, McLaren is declared the winner on a technicality, as one of their cars crossed the finish line just ahead. Although devastated by this decision, Miles is grateful to Shelby for giving him the opportunity to race at Le Mans. Two months after Le Mans, Miles is testing the J-car at Riverside International Raceway, Miles experiences another brake failure and is killed in the resulting crash. Six months later, Shelby pays Miles' family a visit, Mollie watches as he gives Peter a wrench that Miles threw at him before winning an SCCA race at Willow Springs in 1963. Ford would continue its winning streak at Le Mans in 1967, 1968, and 1969, becoming the only American manufacturer to win the prestigious race. Miles was posthumously inducted into the Motorsports Hall of Fame of America in 2001. Also starring JJ Field as Roy Lunn, Jack McMullen as Charlie Agapiou, Benjamin Rigby as Bruce McLaren, Alex Gurney as Dan Gurney (playing his own father) and Ben Collins (formerly The Stig in Top Gear) as Denny Hulme. Damon as the man putting everything into making the winning vehicle and Bale as the loose cannon British racer unafraid to say whatever he thinks are both perfectly cast. It is most interesting true story, corporate company Ford wanting to regain their mojo by winning the 24-hour race, conflicting with the maverick petrolheads, fantastic chalk-and-cheese characters. You grow to like the characters in the slower moments, then you go to breakneck speed in the twists and turns of the racetracks, the race sequences are indeed fast paced with nail-biting crashes, all fantastically edited and with terrific sound design, overall it is an exciting and most enjoyable sports drama. Very good!"
"Ok well... I found a fair bit of the script (especially in early scenes) way too expositional. Some characters rather one dimensional (e.g. Leo Beebe).
It doesn't help that Josh Lucas has the kind of eyes/looks that are too distracting, he should just be a model! Central casting was clearly in the hands of someone with a 'type', which meant the players sometimes looked like an Annie Leibowitz Vanity Fair centre spread of the fashion worlds glitterati.
The director seemed to want to include the 'Englishness' theme (properly recognising the British influence on racing at this period and elsewhere) a little too much, so Miles and Mrs Miles sometimes seemed to be trotting out shorthand for the same.
I know Bale was (is?) English, but his choice of regional accent (though it may have been factually correct, I don't know) jarred a little for me.
All that said, I did think Bale (who I don't ever really 'like' due to an inherent lack of warmth) was very good (as he usually is) and well cast; Damon was superb (AA nominee superb) in a more complex and nuanced role. Likewise Tracey Letts playing Ford, whom I know from the excellent 'Divorce'.
One thing that I never understood was that despite the film suggesting Ford was coming from a standing start, suddenly with no explanation a car arrives from England which is clearly the core of what became the GT40....what?!
I loved the style and the pace, the colour and the cinematography etc, and I thought the race scenes and the general race milieu were brilliantly depicted. I have seen The Times (London) critics dismissing the film as old fashioned etc, and as I say it has some clunky dialogue and characters get tells, but if it is old fashioned in any way, it is that it tells a story about people and their complexity and what it takes to deliver the extraordinary, rather than reiterate some fear based drivel about how the world will be saved by a morally ambiguous superhero in Lycra. So thank God for that.
Rather like many a good race, it had a bumpy start but got better and better and by the end I was gripped, standing on my feet and cheering (metaphorically). See it on the big screen and enjoy the race atmosphere."
"Christian Bale born a pom the perfect choice here as the pommy go fast man of the 1960s. Matt Damon has never made a bad movie. Onya Matt. Surprise Henry Ford 11 gets a spot to expand his droll dour personna and does it well. I felt his shattering. The movie score superb I shazamed it. Ford V8 engines have always emitted the ulimate raunchy note by far european engines dont come close. Damon and Bale bounce off each other so well. The visuals pace vibrance super
Suport actors great especially Carrol Shelby main man. Thank you
Patrick
PS read a few purist petrol head reviews where away from escapism the Ford Motor Co was described as Goliath as in David and ...... Well Ferrari did sell out to a Italian socialist Govenment owned Fiat Motor Co
Who was Goliath free enterprise Ford or Italy Government Fiat Motor Co ?

"Once in a while, there is a movie that gives you hope that Hollywood has, finally, broken its addiction to sequels, reboots, adaptations and other ""reinventions"". A movie of such technique, panache, storytelling and outright acting prowess that catapults it into the realm of The Classics.Ladies and Gentlemen, James Mangold and his team of craftsmen have delivered this rare jewel of a movie.A linear journey into the lives of racers (Shelby and Miles), executives (Iacocca and Beebe) and visionaries (Ford and Ferrari), locked in a battle for racing supremacy, raged in the grandest of arenas: Daytona, Sebring and Le Mans. A battle where each screw, each bolt and each suspension inch can make or break the journey to the top.A battle that is waged by figures terrifically played by a fantastic cast of actors, first amongst them a performance for the ages by Christian Bale as Ken Miles, who clearly signifies that he is on the prowl for another slew of awards. Matt Damon shines as Shelby, although he reaches summits mostly when interacting with the aforementioned Bale. The Miles family also benefits from excellent performances, that of Noah Jupe as his son being among the most touching one given this decade.
Commenting at length on the rest of the performances would take too long, but there is not a single solitary performance that is off or even slightly broken. Of special mention is those of Tracy Letts as a gruff but driven Henry Ford II, and a ""bravo"" for the ages for Remo Girone, who does Enzo Ferrari incredible justice with such a short screen presence, conveying the pride, passion and dignity that characterized the life of the Modena-born engineer.This review would not be complete without commenting on the meat of the movie: the racing sequences. These are going to enter in the history of moviemaking as ""magnum opuses"" of the genre, with the gorgeous lighting, crisp editing, roaring sound effects and effectively timed musical addendums turning the 20-minutes-or-so Le Mans racing sequence into a masterful art work in and of itself, no small feat.In retrospect, and quoting Kingsley Amis, we are in the presence of a flawless masterpiece""."
"As I'm not a huge car racing fan I was a little hesitant about seeing Le Mans '66, but this is not a racing film, well it is and it isn't, so if I enjoyed it, despite the racing, I'm sure that most others would too, and racing fans even more so.The mark of a good film is being so engrossed in it that you don't even realise how long it is, which is exactly the case with Le Mans '66. In fact I was astounded when I was told how long it was afterwards.Unlike some other shorter films, which have occasionally dragged on, the two hours and 42 minutes of this film flew by leaving me completely sated.It's a great story, especially knowing it's a true one, but bear in mind it's not a documentary but a movie, so there's going to be some artistic license.Some incredible acting made me warm to some individuals and abhor some others, exclaiming out loud 'you bleep'. The intensity and rush of the race to race, and the racing itself drew me in and made me eager for them to achieve their goals.The film succeeds in every way a retelling of an historic event should, making you care, informing you and entertaining you.My advice, get yourself in gear, race down to your local cinema, and settle in for a for a darn good ride along."
"A great story being transferred to the big screen, it was inevitable that the facts would be a bit dramatized but nonetheless an awesome way to show how great Ken Miles was.
The movie can be also watched by the ones not familiar with the story."
What a great movie! It's all about Christian Bale.. Big Salute to you.. What a transformation and action. Remembering Machinist movie... Oscar wining performance.
"The US title is closer to the film. It's not really Le Mans 66. The story and its telling is brilliant. As someone who has been to Le Mans and used to race cars, I can say that it doesn't convey the atmosphere or the general background noise. The pits in the film are authentic down to the dark concrete corridor at the back. The new pits are nothing like the older pits. As a story it is superb, but lacks what is needed to make a fantastic motor racing film."
"I am not a cars fan, I didn't know the history behind this movie, after a little research, of course isn't 100% fact because isn't a documentary.
Taking previous considerations, the script doesn't add anything without a purpose, the movie is engaging from first to the last scene. All actors have great chemistry each other, the CGI is barely noticeable, this is a true wonderful REAL car's movie. If not fans of automobiles really enjoy this, car lovers are going to love it.
The photography put the viewers in the action and emotions, it's wonderful too. One of the best movies of the year. This movie is gonna keep growing and growing in box office because no good movie passes without many people noticing."
"BANGSYATTT!!! Christian Bale. Matt Damon. PURE TALENT. This movie isnt just for race fans, its funny and thrilling. Great to know its based on true story. 100% memorable. Probably my fav race type film."
"What an amazing movie and stellar performance from Christian Bale. In fact the whole movie is not about LeMans or Ford, but about this wonderful character Ken Miles. After seeing the movie I guessed it was all exaggeration à la Hollywood, but after doing some digging I came to the conclusion it was all historically correct. He was really that brilliant test/racing driver and engineer, mainly responsible for the development of the GT40. Disliked by the Ford management because of his attitude and outspoken opinions and robbed from his LeMans victory by these same people. Besides the story, the racing is visually stunning and the CGI crashes make you duck in your seat. A masterpiece you should watch on the big screen. Only criticism is the stupid Fast and Furious like shifting and turbo noise when the engine is pushed towards 7000rpm. Why Hollywood, why?"
"Hand clapping and tear drops when Miles was slowing down, waiting for other 2 Ford cars and touch the finish line together"
"Ford v Ferrari, or 'le Mans 66' as it's called here, is a decent above average based on a true story movie. It's very pretty to look at. It has very good actors being watchable and charming as mavericks to root for, and suits who are charmingly smarmy and inept. It has beautiful cars doing what beautiful cars should be doing, being driven photogenically.There's nothing to complain about. It's 2.5hr run-time doesn't drag at all, it swishes by as amiably as a Sunday drive through familiar countryside in good company. Bale does Bale. Damon does Damon. The GT40 is the prettiest race car ever. Things are as they should be.It's just not particularly memorable either."
"This is a great movie with incredible race sequences and acting by the 2 leads - Christian Bale and Matt Damon. The sound effects are really awesome, please do go and watch this movie !!"
"This is why I love going to big screen cinemas.
Larger than life and immersive theatre. What an amazing experience. A petrolhead's dream movie.Bale is fantastic as always, Damon solid and the rest of the cast good.The racing is extraordinary. Such fantastic cinematography.If you love cars, history, or just a good movie, this is for you!"
"I hadn't watched any movies of its kind before, and just saw it a couple of days ago. The acting was great, but a couple lines could've been better. The action was phenomenal, with some very intense and thrilling moments. The sound and soundtrack was very immersive, and really helped the movie out as a whole. The only other complaint I have is that one of the antagonists was very 'cookie-cutter', had quite a few bad lines.All around a fun and exciting experience."
"James Mangold's latest star studded creation delivers jolting and mesmerizing performances by both lead actors - Matt Damon and tenaciously comedic Christian bale, which transforms the movie about corporate rivalry into well acted, entertaining, perfectly directed film which is based on a true story. The film hypnotizes both racing and non racing enthusiast into submission of glorious cinematic tale."
It was so good I want to see it again in IMAX. Christian Bale deserves an Oscar nom and definitely so far .
"Not just for Enzo Ferrari, but also for Henry Ford II, Shelby, the cars, the tracks, and especially, the star of the show, not-a-people-person Ken ""Bulldog"" Miles. I learn so many deep lessons from it. Like the race itself, every shot, every act, every background music was delivered with vision, ambition, courage, hope, and willingness to take and overcome any kind of risk and challenges on its path. Matt Damon delivers it, Christian Bale kills it (not the british accent tho, it's a little bit weird) and the ending..... the ending, !! it broke my heart, but what can I say other than reality (sometimes) sucks? Every movie fan would like it, every race car lover would love it, and there's me, who enjoy every second of two and a half hours of it, from title to the end credits."
This is one of the best racing movies along with rush hence if you liked rush you'll like this movie but honestly rush was better in terms of directing and storyline however this movie is amazing because of the solid performances of Christian and Matt..is it worth watching ? DEFINITELY YES..it's one of the very few movies that are long but you really don't want the movie to end like you are enjoying every single moment of the movie just like driving a Ferrari or something you don't feel the time!
"It's hard to compare Rush (racer biography by Ron Howard) I suppose Rush race scenes were more intense, but the 2 leads didn't have chemistry like Bale and Damon in this one. Their friendship, colleagues and families really helped carry the story for 2.5 hours.The story is relevant in both auto race and corporate history. The director did a great job bringing the audience to this specialized industry with effective narratives so we could all enjoy the ride without feeling lost.There were so much to digest in the dialogues and so many good action scenes to admire that I would recommend watching it again! p.s. try covering your ears in the theatre, because I overheard spoilers in the hallway (*__*) not cool~! Another occasion, I had to put on my headphone on the train to avoid hearing spoilers."
"Straightforward story: build race cars that can win Le Mans.
But that is only the start...you need the best driver in the business, even if he is a bit touchy now and then. Not sure the corporate obstacles were real, but I suppose the writers needed to add some conflict. Nah...1 point deduction.
Racing/testing scenes are really well done. Fast and furious, indeed."
"This is just great! Bale and Damon are really convincing as a pair of ""individuals"" who design and build - with the help of some wooden door wedges - a magnificent feat of motor engineering despite their own personal demons; corporate America - exemplified by a thoroughly odious Josh Lucas and the pretty horrible French weather. Noah Jupe, who plays Bale's son Peter is also superb. The race photography and sound are wonderful - you really do get sucked into the exhilaration of it all. The only thing missing is the smell of the petrol fumes. I was slightly dubious that I could ever want a Ford (think: box, square, dull, Henry Fonda) to defeat a Ferrari (think: sleek. red, classy, James Dean) but in the end, I sort of did. 2½ hours just flies by. Interestingly, there is a distinct paucity of swearing in this film, too. Big screen/sound essential."
"Ford v Ferrari is one of those few movies based on well-made real events, which means that most of these types of movies concentrate more on telling the event that happened and completely forget about telling a good story based on facts. real with interesting characters, funny moments, visually entertaining scenes, etc. And that is exactly why Ford v Ferrari is such a good movie, it does all of the above and more, and all that is topped off with the incredible performances of Christian Bale and Matt Damon and the chemistry they manage to do between the two. The film does not lack action or humor, both are perfectly leveled, humor is not silly this is introduced in a good way, something that other films of this genre do not understand, in real life there are comic moments, people laughs, not because it is a film based on real events means that there can be no comedy, of course it can as long as it is within reason, just as the action is great, neither more nor less is not forced or anything like that, and those would be the main elements that make the film visually attractive. The film does well not to put the protagonists aside, it gives the characters a touch of personality which makes them interesting, while telling their story, but let's be honest the real protagonist is Ken Miles (Christian Bale) because the film focuses more on his personal life, than that of Carroll Shelvy (Matt Damon), since it sets him the goal of overcoming himself physically and psychologically, and Ken is a true race driver, to hell with Dominic Toretto I want Ken Miles. But despite all that the character of Matt Damon is not far behind he also tries to overcome either because of his health problems overcome that he will not be able to compete anymore, and building a car faster than those of Ferrari at any cost. The film did well by not showing Ferrari as an evil company to win, it is only a battle of companies, even when Ken wins the race at the end Enzo Ferrari (Remo Girone) shows his respect, one competes against another not because one is good and the other bad, but because of what all companies want money, they want to have the best product to sell, although we support Ford not because they are good or something, but by perspective, we support Ford because the protagonists are with Ford, we would support Ferrari if the protagonists were with Ferrari, in fact the closest to being a villain in this movie would be Leo Bee (Josh Lucas) who is on the side of Ford, and I say the closest because it really is not bad within reason, he just has personal problems with Ken, he doesn't like it, he doesn't want it. And speaking of Ken, I loved his death, I say it moved me, but I say I liked it because it was a great element added to the movie, I think this because it was not something that was removed from the sleeve, the problem of the brakes and of not being able to get out of the car, it had already been used previously in the film, which gives a great touch to Ken's death, it happened once I managed to survive, another happened but this time he wasnt so lucky, The address, although it is not the best in the world, is great, there are several scenes that I can't think of as they were recorded, obviously if there were one with another with special effects, but in other words it is the best part of Mangold. Actually the only complaint I have to this movie would be Lee Iacocca (Jon Bernthal) is not that I did not like the character on the contrary I like it, but the problem is that in the first act you are introduced as 3rd protagonist, but As the film progresses, it loses prominence, taking away its place of 3rd protagonist. In conclusion Ford v Ferrari is one of the best movies of 2019, which I really think should be nominated for best film, with a good story, interesting characters, epic moments, great performances, a great direction from Goldman and apart from its best movie, I think this movie is a good 9/10."
"This is what cinema is supposed to be, simply fun. You have beautiful cinematography, great acting, a ridiculous sense of speed and danger during the races, accentuated by some great music, an emotional story... I could go on, but most of it is really positive. It drags a bit by the end, and the main ""bad guy"" is a bit exaggarated, he's there just to be bad, no motive or characterization, but hey, i really hated him. All in all a very pleasant surprise, i was biting my nails the whole time."
"Great film, great directing and production. Matt, Christian, Caitriona, Noah and Josh did a brilliant job. The film held me from start to finish. Loved the racing, the fight on the street, loved Mollie making Ken be honest in her driving scene. Noah one to watch in the future
."
"This has got to be the greatest movie ever made about any sport. No computer CGI here. Everything about this movie was real. The acting is top notch, the driving and race sequences pure perfection and the great thing about this movie were the cars."
Fascinating look into the race to get a Ford into let mans. Good storytelling and acting from the leads. Ending is rather abrupt.
This is by far the best movie of 2019. A movie worth going to see on the big screen. Great acting!!!
"Love and hate for this movie, and I understand. If you aren't into cars or racing then this isn't your thing to watch, simple as that. But for the muscle car lovers and espescially the Ford Mustang lover Shelby will ring a bell.Simply said, this is the story about Caroll Shelby and Ken Miles. Their love for cars and starting a battle against Ferrari to build a faster car. And that's what it's all about. Cars, cars and cars and the friendship bewteen the two and their fight against Ford to get started building the GT40.Excellent performance from Bale and Damon as from the rest two which are perfectly chosen for their characters. And the British accent of Bale, so nice.Full of action and suspense and of course the death of Miles. A must see for all geeks for cars.
Gore 0/5
Nudity 0/5
Effects 3/5
Story 4/5
Comedy 0/5"
"If you like cars, this is a must see! It was also fun to watch Jason Bourne and Batman fight each other."
"The movie was well made and from that I have read, mostly historically accurate. It had great actors, the ferrari's looked gorgeus along other cars, if some parts of the races were cgi (most likely many were) they weren't recoqnisable.It felt a bit off that the Italians were clearly made out to be the bad guys, with the drivers facial expressions among other things. Also we didn't see anything from Ferrari outside the racing scenes. I also would have really liked to see a bit of the cars design process, but no, the car just suddenly appeared out of no where. Miles's wife's sudden mental breakdown in their car also felt off and was a bit strange. The movie generally left a lot of stuff unexplained, even though it was 2,5h long. Every time when the cars were racing music was playing in the background, I would have liked to have sometimes only hear the cars engines."
The racing scenes are amazing and the acting is sublime
"Cool film great acting awesome cars brilliant story ........!!!!!!!! Christian Bale never fails to act his socks off also Matt Damon was his cool self and the supporting cast all played there part , cool film i would defo reccommend .....!!!!"
"Because I am not. However, I enjoyed it fully.Because at its core, it is a universal principle: go after what you believe, you can and will do it. Don't take short cut and don't regret.This is a inspirational movie for everyone, everyone wants to do something out of ordinary. Totally recommend it."
"It's been a long time since I went to a movie that was so good it stayed with me for days. I, being a automotive enthusiast knew this story well yet the outcomes of the story still brought a tear to my eye. So well played. Nice that so many real cars were used and so accurately. It would seem Steve McQueen's Le mans would have been like this is if it was done today."
"A simple heartfelt story of a friendship vs corporate egos. The story's car jargon doesn't confuse the audience.Also the CGI and Pratical effects only enhance the movie and never take away the experience from it. The movie is the beautiful, old fashioned (story arc wise) and definitely a blast!"
Hell of a movie. Those roaring engine are pure orgasm with a thriller and riveting plot. Energetic and extremely talented actors. Worth every buck!
"I didn't know what to expect entering the cinema, as the trailers did not necessarily promise a good movie, but this film was just perfect. Honestly, I teared up hard a few times, it was just overwhelmingly beautiful cinematographivally, dramatically, and philosophically."
"I saw this movie yesterday, and had no intention of reviewing it. I simply can't stop thinking about it, because it's probably one of the best films of the year.With a fast pace and a long runtime, this movie doesn't waste your time. It tells a beautiful story of two men achieving what was thought impossible at the time, and about the people who helped them make it happen. Beating Ferrari on Le Mans...in the 1960s.This movie was a lot of fun, better than I expected, and emotional. There were some scenes that almost made me cry because the movie made me so invested into the characters (who are real people). Christian and Matt did an amazing job.My only flaw is that they portray Ferrari too negatively at times, but the story needs an antagonist. And Im glad they didn't go overboard with that, but it was kind of annoying since I like Ferrari.My rating: 9/10"
"It is a well scripted, well directed movie with great camera work and right blend of emotions. Bale Damon's duo works out perfectly."
"This movie genuinely describes what actually trying means when somebody strives for something bigger. No unrealistic goal, their agenda was pretty clear - learn from mistakes. I also admire the acting. I enjoyed every second of this movie. Truly a masterpiece biography of the two legendary companies."
"Really good film. Just a really well acted, well written, efficiently executed film with an engaging story and characters you are invested in to match. I was starting to think Hollywood had forgotten how to put out good content. But this is really worth your time. If you're interested in history, cars, racing, and just good storytelling in general you should see this. Christian Bale and Matt Damon are wonderful together, with Bale particularly just knocking it out of the park. Mangold continues his flex on everyone in his rise to auteur level filmmaking, beginning with ""Logan"" and continuing with this movie...Thoroughly enjoyed it."
Pure entertainment. Storytelling at its best. Not one political agenda addressed. Not one sjw box checked. A masterclass in entertainment designed for those who watch movies to be entertained. Masterpiece. Satisfying until the credits roll at the end. Do not miss this amazing movie
"I'm not a motorhead or fan of motor sports at all. Yet, I found this to be a very compelling story. Well done, from he performances of the cast, the cinematography, the writing, everything was spot on. I was a bit skeptical when I saw it came in at 2 1/2 hours, thinking there was going to be a lot of self indulgent scenes, but I was surprised to find none of that. The time flew by faster than the cars."
"Saw this with some of my family but not expecting too much as the reviews from the upmarket press weren't too good. But they were wrong, really enjoyed it. Good drama/story and people you cared about. Great driving scenes and witty lines too.
I guess the reason The Guardian didn't like it was that it was about western white men driving planet killing (!) cars. And not an LGBT person in sight!So it seemed real. And because it was a true story there were no silly dramas/twists to try and make it more exciting. The truth, we'll presented, was exciting enough."
"Ford vs Ferrari is a good, fun movie for those of us who like cars. It's got a good story, great camera work, and is well paced. Caitriona Belfe was perfectly cast, and so was Christian Bale. The one criticism I had was that several performances were easy; it didn't feel like some of the performances really had to reach that far, didn't have to extend themselves into the roles that much, just sort of going through the motions. The car(s) ultimately felt like the star of the movie, plural because there are plenty of nice car eye candy throughout. Again, I enjoyed this movie, it was fun and satisfying, and had some good funny moments."
"Wow! Great directing, love all the race scene! I was kept fully attention the whole time. Very exciting to watch. Very inspiring movie as well."
