"(This has a post-credit scene in case you're wondering)The songs are great. Especially Kristoff's song, an 80's jam as Jonathan Groff would say it. Even the animation looks like an 80's music video which I find funny. Olaf's comedic skits are even funnier. For Into the Unknown, not as catchy as Let it Go but time will tell. The animation, the best. Elsa got even beautifuller. If you saw the water animation you would see *much* more of that. The story is bigger, questions are answered, but there are some points that look silly. The plot is predictable but personally I enjoyed it.The only thing I'm having a hard time agreeing with is the ending."
"This is a beautiful movie, and Elsa's journey is a powerful one to watch. But outside of this it's narrative is completely unfocused and none of the character moments are given the time they deserve on screen. It seems that it's trying to be more adult with more lore and a darker tone, but also still gives Olaf an unnecessary about of screen time doing things that the little kids would laugh at. The pacing also feels quite rushed, even by kids movie standards. You could have cut 20 minutes out of this movie and it would have been just as good."
"It's not hard to imagine how big this movie will be. I, as well as many others, am a huge fan of the first film and the short films that followed it. Frozen II has a different feel to it. While the first film was brimming with quirky moments, the follow up feels a little more mature in its plot and themes. This story heavily centers around the importance of change, even if that means letting go. Throughout the film, I found myself dazzled with the quality and beauty of the visuals that the animation team laid out. The story, for me, felt a little flat, however. I think the writing team missed the mark when trying to achieve the same quirkiness from the original. With the more dramatic path the writers chose to take, also came more epic musical numbers and effects. Sure there were still plenty of humorous moments, but I personally felt myself longing for more. I also find irony in the fact that this film centers around change and the overall feel of the film felt like a major shift from the first. I do think this film will still appeal to many others and I, myself, am still very excited to watch it a second time. Overall, I'd say this film found success in what it was trying to achieve and the message it was trying to send to its viewers, but couldn't quite live up to the whimsicality of the original. While not as good as the first, it's still a film you will want to take your family to and is a great addition to the Frozen franchise. 7/10"
"Frozen II felt unsatisfying. There was lots of build up to a very short climax that felt way too easy and simple. I kept expecting another adventure which never came. The film feels short and unfinished. That said, the animation is absolutely gorgeous and I did find the film quite funny. If you go into this with low expectations I think you'll enjoy yourself."
"Before I say anything, let me tell you that some girls were crying around my seats, so I think movie hits its demograhy.I liked the visuals of the movie, it looks amazing, better than first one. There's lot more going on happening in the movie and it's just 1hour 50 mins long, so a lot of arcs are very rushed and convenient. There are scenea where one character tells the other that this is what they have to do, to get something, with no explanation or reasons. There's lot of, I mean lots of, exposition. Characters tell the stories, tell something they just know or feel and flashbacks or hallucinations kind-of stuff.But this is a movie aimed to kids, and it's okay if the story wasn't technically sound. But for adults, this movie might be too silly at times.About the songs, this time expectations were high, and I didn't like a single song from movie. There were times when I felt they just ripped off their own song from previous movie, let it go. Like last time, no song connected emotiolly with the character, but they're well performed.Kudos to animation team, voice actors, art-designers.
Not so much for writers and screen play writers."
"The animation in Frozen II is stunning. The level of detail and flow is a triumph. The story, however, is preachy and forced. Anna is annoyingly controlling and overprotective. All of the songs are overwrought and not really memorable, and the characters sing a lot. No need to buy this one, one viewing is enough."
"I was really looking forward to this movie, but sadly I left the theater quite disappointed.The good things first:
Visually, this movie is stunning. The attention to detail is breathtaking and it really draws into the movie.
The music is also very good. I wouldn't say better than the music of the first movie, but especially the main theme (which is HEAVILY inspired by Michael Jacksons ""Earth Song"") was really something special.But this also brings me to my biggest problems with the movie: Predictability due to being HEAVILY INSPIRED by so many other things.Additionally to MJs Earth Song, probably the most obvious inspiration:
Any Avatar: The Last Airbender fan will instantly see the connection to this movie. It really takes alot from that show, which sadly, in many ways, makes it really predictable. As soon as I heard about the ""5th spirit"" I instantly knew it was Elsa, AKA The Avatar (yeah, I know she can't control all Elements, but I'm sure they would've liked to do that aswell, wouldn't it retcon the first movie).Also, the main story of ""We thought our ancestor (or whoever) were good people, but they were actually bad"" is also something we've seen SO MANY TIMES before, so that part was very predicatable too. Basically from the first scene on you can tell that that's the twist.So we have two ""twists"" that are utterly predictable, and sadly, those are the only two twists. (If you want to tell me that you thought Elsa was actually dead, you're a liar.)One additional nitpick: The whole ""water has a memory"" thing was really overused and quite stupid.Aaand one more: That love and friendship is important is always a good message for the kids, but please, don't abuse and overuse it like that future filmmakers.To sum it up:
Ultimately, what you get is this: A beautifully sounding and visually stunning movie that is so predictable that it's really quite hard to enjoy the good things."
"Guys, six years and this is what you got? Disney is really bad at sequels. The story could wrap up in a regular episode's time, and is actually a replicant of the first, with much less weight. The repeating of the structure made my eyes roll. Side characters are weak. The protagonists got no growths, Christopher's line even got cut off after the middle part.The music is okay, can see the effort, and I appreciate the fine scores. Music not bad in general, but Disney's been better.The visual effects and the animations of characters are great. But I know Disney is good at that. Do better on the story please!"
"This. This was the sequel I was HOPING for. I was in tears of every variety for the majority of the film. The animation was flawless, the songs were abundant and wonderful (nothing quite as earwormy as Let It Go, though) and the laughter was non-stop.The character growth was also a treat. I didn't expect that, especially from a character like Olaf.All the negative reviews I see complain about it either being too dark or all over the place. It was neither. Sure, it had some darkness to it, but so does life, and like most moments in life, their is a shining bright light waiting on the other side, even if it's not the ending I would have expected.And to those saying it was all over the place? It wasn't, if you bothered to pay attention. But most of you are adults who write off every animated feature as children's fare and don't really care to pay attention. And that is because you've lost the child inside. You've forgotten how to feel joy and excitement and embrace it like you did as a child. You confuse your contentedness with your children's happiness with actual joy and live vicariously through them than embracing what's inside of you and living your own happiness yourself. And for that, I pity you all."
"Visuals were stunning as always. Characters are meh but some ofthem are likable. Honestly I don't remember any of the songs. As an adult, I didn't enjoy it. It's for kids like everyone says so."
"As much as I hate to say this, aside from the gorgeous visuals, the plot; third act, was VERY poor. Nothing really happens. There is no threat, no villain, no obstacle...Elsa wanders off to a 'fortress of solitude' type place where she dies? or freezes? Anna sings about her grief, the song itself was great but I couldn't feel anything for her because Elsa's outcome was very ambiguous? Anna is set out to do something that could set Elsa free but....there are no consequences which was mentioned about a hundred times...""the water will destroy Arendelle..."" and all of a sudden Elsa comes out of nowhere and stops the flood. It was too rushed, and the plot itself was not fulfilling, AT ALL."
"Rating 2.6/10
I will admit, I am not a fan of animated films, but this movie was not very entertaining even considering that. The story was silly and the progression of the story was very lazy. This movie had no magic, no emotion & no soul. The songs were atrocious !! I wouldn't watch it again, but a lot of people will probably like it."
The story was great (especially that great Olaf scene) and the music was once again a hit. Good job to the team at Disney!
This movie was absolutely stunning! The story was beautiful and so was the movie itself. I enjoyed it more than the first. Don't listen to what people say and just go enjoy the movie!
"So, I don't want to complain about this too much because it's a literal kids movie, but I also think that just because something is meant for kids, doesn't mean it can't be smart or have depth. The first Frozen is ultimately better, in almost every aspect of the movie, but this isn't a horrible sequel. It does, however, have a lot of wasted potential.The plot was a simple premise, though it was surprisingly convoluted with all the different revelations about the past. I was glad they didn't retcon their parents' death, but the whole thing with Anna and Elsa's mom's voice travelling through time or whatever that was, wasn't explained well at all. The first one at least had some character arcs, however simple, but they were there. The point of sequels is to build onto the existing world and characters, and there was hardly any of that when it came to the characters. Kristoff was literally just worried about proposing to Anna and added nothing to the plot, Anna sort of had an issue with being overprotective of Elsa and learning to tone that down and trust her, but there wasn't much focus on that throughout the story. And Elsa hardly had any motivations. They tried to give her an arc about not wanting to be a queen and doing things with her magic instead, but it was hardly set up. And Elsa finding out she's like, the bridge between humanity and magic was so glossed over, and this would've been a great resource for some inner conflict. The themes, along with the character arcs or lack thereof, were equally as blurry. The first one had such strong themes of sisterhood and accepting your ""inner demons"" so to speak, and that just made it all the more obvious that this one didn't really have any clear themes. They tried to have a theme about change, but there was only the after affect as opposed to a set up and pay off.And as for some nit-picky comments, Olaf's whole self-aware/woke/attempt at teenage dark and existential humor was so very distracting and annoying. And while the whole idea of ""I'll understand when I'm older"" is a decent lesson to give the kids watching, but this is still a movie, and some subtlety in lessons like this would've been helpful. The songs were fine. Different, which is great, but just fine. Not really memorable, unfortunately. Unless it was intentional to avoid the oversaturation of the first Frozen's music.But, there were some pros. The movie was enjoyable, I'm not saying it was totally miserable to watch. The animation was amazing, and there were a few sequences that felt very Fantasia 2000. Plus, they did a great job showing some new locations and magic so it didn't feel like a visual recycling of scenes from the first Frozen. Similarly, adding the other four elements felt natural for the sequel since it added onto Elsa's powers.Again, it wasn't a totally miserable movie to watch. It was fine, there were some good aspect, as well as some bad. Understandably, I'm sure it'll make a ton of money, and there will be a ton of merchandise sold because of it. I just wish that hugely popular kids movies weren't considered an easy route to a ton of money just because they're meant for kids. Something like Inside Out is a pretty good example of a deeper, smarter kids blockbuster that has lessons for younger kids while also appeal to older audiences. 6.5/10."
"Many isolated components of this film were fine or fabulous. The visuals in particular look incredible. The songs, message and concepts within the narrative are fine to great.However the story, logic and writing to keep all these parts together in an effective way is lacking. And that's really what makes or breaks a feature film. That's why I give it a 4.Kids will likely enjoy it anyway. But adults will mostly like this one less than the first one. And the first one wasn't exactly a perfect story either. But in the first one I felt like things were at stake. Within this sequel I saw enough magic and implausible fixes within every encounter that I started at times to get annoyed rather than release that the protagonists were alright. And that's not good."
"This was the first
Just want to say I disagree with you Gunsjoe- the plot was definitely not simplistic. In fact it was a bit complicated if you ask me. I thought the movie and the story overall was excellent, as was the music. It even includes an 80s style ballad from Kristoff. My young girls loved it as did my wife and I."
"Taking place in a kingdom named Arendelle, there lived two kingly daughters named Elsa (Idina Menzel) and Anna (Kristen Bell). Elsa, the older sister, miraculously possesses a magic power that allows her to create ice around her. These strengths made Elsa had to live her life as a runaway, before finally returning to Arendelle thanks to Anna's struggle and hard work.Elsa and Anna's adventure in Frozen 2 began with Elsa's curiosity about a mysterious song that seemed to keep calling her from the north. Along with the emergence of the sound, Arendelle began to experience a variety of oddities such as a river that dries, hurricanes that hit, and others.In the first film, the audience is made a little wonder, where did Elsa get that power. This question will be answered in Frozen 2 which, unfortunately, is not explained in a straightforward and logical way.Compared to the first film, Frozen 2 does have a more complicated plot and, maybe, hard to digest for young children. Not only that, the nuances throughout the film are also darker than the prequel. However, Frozen 2 still deserves to be called a very neat film, especially visually.
Makes you curious? You have to watch it so that all your questions are answered ..."
"Forgettable songs and special effects cannot make up for a lack of an interesting story.
A GOOD story matters most , Disney!
Another in the increasing trend of version II, III, IV ...ad nauseum... follow-ups that should never have seen the light of day.
The original Frozen was brilliant, but this doesn't come anywhere near it.
Save your money. Watch something better."
It is pure commercial. They added characters without clear reason. Tried to support the movie by having a lot of songs. Again without clear reason.
"I can stretch my mind to make sense of this very confusing movie or at least very confusing parts. Ask your child afterwards about the movie and what they got out of it.
Some of the songs were great actually but most were off key and not very good. I was hoping for a real good movie. Good animation."
"Its not as good as the first one but still fairly decent at times.I liked the animation which was godly as expected by Disney. The developing relationship between Elsa and Anna. Kristoff felt like the first wheel i already didnt like him in the first one but in the sequel he is even worse.At last the Olaf scenes were decent, at times i guess but annoying for the most part, they felt very forced and just there to get more Olaf in there.I wont spoil anything story wise but as much as a wanted to like it the ending was pretty weak."
"This movie has beautiful visuals. The scenes and animation is breathtaking. I liked that very much.Here's a controversial opinion; I quite liked the music and songs as well though It lacks the iconic catchy tunes from the first one.My biggest complaint and the one thing that let this down is the story. Its way too simplistic. Now granted the first one wasn't Mark-Twain like either but you get the feeling that it was more substantial than this and as an adult there was more in the first one for you than this.I'm still rating this pretty good because as much as I'm personally underwhelmed by the story, I'm not the target audience. This is a movie for little children and I guess they might have a different opinion. I wouldn't know for sure since I dont have children to take to the movies. I would like to, but I need to find a wife first for that to happen."
"Sterling animation and a solid soundtrack are the strongest points in this sequel's favor. For the most part, sequels don't measure up to the original and this is no exception. This film surprised me in how easily it resolved things. Unfortunately, it also put me to sleep at one or two points; that is unusual. What it lacked in storytelling, it made up for with tremendous visuals. Recommended mostly to viewers with young children."
"There is nothing great about this movie. Just an unnecessary sequel that had a poor story and lame songs. Even kids got bored and left the hall.Wanted to give 5
But giving 6 for its high quality animated graphics."
"'Frozen 2' is the sequel to the 2013 Disney animated classic 'Frozen'. In this six year gap, Disney pulled off a very exciting story that follows Elsa as he discovers the origin of her powers!This follow up is a little darker than the first but not entirely dark as there's loads of great lighthearted funny moments, especially with the cute character Olaf! However, do expect that younger viewers may not enjoy this one as much as it also does have a more complex storyline that may be tricky for them to follow.The animation was Disney's best and one of the best I've seen since YEARS! Awesome little details, very unique atmosphere designs and art direction.The songs were GOOD but not GREAT. Especially, compared to the first movie. I can guarantee that ""Into The Unknown"" was supposed to be the new ""Let It Go"", it's a beautiful song but doesn't quite capture the essence of the original song! ""Show Yourself"" and Kristoff's song ""Lost in the Woods"" will be VERY popular I'm guessing! And I do think that Olaf should stick to making jokes in the movie rather than singing.The story was complicated and good but again, not as great as the first perhaps but still a very good one that will leave unanswered questions answered (nearly).But to round it off, 'FROZEN 2' was beautiful, exciting and will definitely want you coming back for more!!"
"Expected little going in but still left feeling ripped off, almost insulted by the ho-hum-algorithmic-washed-up storyline, characters, score/music, and animation/ visuals. Do better Disney. Please."
"Let me state before I go further, I loved the original. The original had heart, warmth, re playable songs. Maybe I saw the original too much and expected the same? Maybe between Frozen and Frozen 2 there were one too many shorts?I can't even tell you what the plot for Frozen 2 is about, and I just SAW it. The plot is literally all over the place. As everyone states, the only great thing about Frozen 2 is the superb animation,, but the story is dry.The songs are not memorable or catchy as the original. I didn't feel any love in Frozen 2, this definitely feels another quick "" let's make a fast Billion dollars again!"" Even the new actors feel ""miscasted"".Sterling K Brown, great actor, felt off in this. It felt there was poor direction."
I love frozen with a passion and have to say this sequel surpasses it by far it is darker more emotional better character build funnier moments greater music and everyone learns a lesson also you learn more about the parents how elsa got her powers and a little bit more of kristof and sefven don't listen to the haters because a true frozen fan will love this as it tugs at your heart
"To be fair, let's start with the good. The animation was amazing. It was like watching 3D with no glasses. Olaf was funny sometimes. For that, they get 3 stars.Now for the bad. Everything else.I can't tell you what I just watched. Five minutes after walking out, I could not tell you one logical nor chronological thing that happened. If I couldn't get the storyline, I am SURE kids didn't get it. The story was completely incoherent. It made absolutely no sense. It just rambled on and on and the more they talked, the less I understood. I asked my kids what they thought the story was about and they said they did not understand it either.The first 15 minutes was funny, cute and engaging. the last 10 minutes was at least exciting and adventurous, but by the time we got there, I didn't even care any more. The middle hour or so was just flat boring. It felt like 2 hours. I kept looking at my watch. I almost fell asleep a few times. Even the music in it was just BAD.I love Disney. I take the kids to every single Disney animated movie I can. I thought the first Frozen was cute and great for kids. This was a mess and a miss. I'm very surprised Disney let this off the editing table. This was a straight-to-DVD movie (or straight the Disney+) at best. People should not have had to pay normal theatre prices for it."
"Saw Frozen 2 tonight. The film is an excellent follow up to the original. Everyone from the original is in it, but unlike the original, this one is darker and more intense.After a prophecy from the trolls, Elsa, Anna, Olaf, Kristoff and Sven go on a quest to save Arendelle. They journey to the Enchanted Forest where their fate awaits them.I won't give it away, except to say that I was pleased and impressed. This time everyone sings, but the song I was waiting for was Kristoff's who belts out ""Lost in the Woods"", a beautiful ballad dedicated to romantic love. I agree with many of the critics who say that it's the best bit in the film. Jonathan Groff has an amazing voice and puts this song over beautifully.If you love Frozen or a Disney lover like me, this film is for you. It's geared to both adults and kids alike.Oh and stay until the end of the credits. You won't be disappointed."
"Had to explain to my kids that the Sterling K. Brown character did not belong in this context and why - gratuitous Identity Politics and caving into the anti-white narrative of Disney. Also, they were too young to pick up on the White Guilt subtext of the story - Anna and Elsa must pay for sins of their white ancestors against poor, oppressed indigenous peoples.See it for the graphics only, which are glorious."
"It was funny, but makes absolutely no sense.
The non humans are the best part."
Dark movie and way too many songs ! They struck gold with Let It Go therefore they just threw in a few dozen of unnecessary songs to see which one becomes another hit.
"Frozen II has the literally chilling quality of how a sequel should be while maintaining the right balance of surprises and expectancy with its moving animation.Frozen II is a sequel that grows with its filmmaking team, audiences, and characters within it. Just like its predecessor, Frozen II explores the theme of growth, self discovery, freedom, determination, acceptance, family, and happiness but explores some greater and arguably darker themes, including changes in one's life, psychological disorders (particularly grief and depression), colonialism, and existentialism. Although the plot does admittedly require some more polishing and time to truly bring its full potential, it is already an engaging entertainment with deep philosophical messages.The characters of the film, as mentioned earlier, grow with the filmmakers and audiences. The already-relatable characters are possibly even more likable in the sequel as they endure changes and hardships in life while staying true to their soul. Each and every character has a flaw that makes them even more relatable to audiences of all ages worldwide. The introduction of the new characters explores the theme of differences, conflict, and peace to further enhance the complexity of the story. These, added with more hearty acting and passionate vocals of its original cast (Veronica Mars and The Good Place's Kristen Bell, Wicked's Idina Menzel, Book of Mormon's Josh Gad, Glee and Mindhunter's Jonathan Groff), Frozen II returns the much-beloved living characters to a higher level of entertainment with their wit, personality, humor, and emotion.The first movie's animation is improved exponentially in the sequel. The lush animation is supplemented by fascinating cinematography, colorful visual and sound effects as well as the implementation of realism in just the right amount. The characters' details, facial expressions, breaths, gestures, and mannerisms are also beautifully animated. Unlike the first Frozen, the production team didn't just include Norwegian geography, environment, cultures, traditions, arts, history, mythology, and consulted with experts to create astonishing details with the visuals, costumes, landscapes, kingdom, architecture, towns, and runic languages (to name a few), but researches were also conducted in Finland and Iceland for the sequel. Even the production team consulted with the leaders of the indigenous people of Scandinavia, the Sámi, to portray their culture respectfully in the film.The new songs are equally superior and equally meaningful (if not better) to the first Frozen's legendary musical numbers while at the same time pay homage to them. Much like the first, the sequel's numbers are catchy and iconic to each of the characters and excel in terms of tunes, melodies, earworms, and build-ups. Not only they are relevant to the plot and the characters' growth, but they are also open for multiple interpretations for audiences of all ages to relate. Last but not least, the music and score elevate every single part of the film as it also includes actual Scandinavian music.For everyone who may dislike or even actively hate Frozen and/or Frozen II without ever seeing it, it's highly advisable to watch it thoroughly with objectivity and not with subjectivity before judging the quality of the film and pretty much any other movie. It is also perfectly a normal, human thing to criticize or not like something, but it would be a rather immature act for criticism to be done with apathy, ignorance, disrespect, and hatred.Finally, no human is perfect and nor will they ever be, not to mention their creation. Even though Frozen II could still be slightly improved (particularly with its plot, timing, new characters, and ending) to match the quality of the original, Frozen II manages to surpass many expectations a sequel is hoped to be and is a worthy addition and continuation of Disney's modern classic, Frozen."
Went to see the movie with high expectations hoping that it would be as good as the first one. Found it to be a sleepy movie... the songs are awful and the storyline was a struggle.I managed to fall asleep halfway of the movie.
"Frozen II is a beautiful continuation of one of the greatest animated films ever made. We know the story and characters from the 2013 film, so it's not as original, surprising and innovative as the first one, but as the story evolves so does the animation. The characters grow in their arc, becoming more mature, with stronger relationships and technically, Frozen II is a much better film than its predecessor.Anna (Kristen Bell), Elsa (Idina Menzel), Kristoff (Jonathan Groff), Olaf (Josh Gad) and Sven have become a family. Now, they try to discover the origin of Elsa's powers in order to save their Kingdom because it seems as if Elsa has awakened some powerful spirits. They leave Arandelle, their hometown, and embark into a Nordic odyssey, in the impetuous fall, where they will face dangers and will meet new characters.During the film's 103 minutes, we are delighted with seven new songs, most of them as iconic as those in the previous film and 19 score tracks. ""Into the Unknown"" stays with you and I'm sure we will hear this beautiful composition at the Oscar ceremony. Frozen II feels like a musical at times and that just makes the movie better.The story is well narrated and easy to follow for little ones. Sisterhood is a powerful force and the bond between Anna and Elsa only strengths during the whole movie.Frozen II is absolutely eye candy with a beautiful color palette similar to the original adding the warm tones of autumn. The filmmakers traveled to Finland, Iceland and Norway for inspiration. They consulted with a botanist in Oslo to make sure the forest resembles the authentic vegetation there. The animation is not just beautiful, but also a great representation of the Nordic folklore and the geography of the places.We can also appreciate the advances in technology in the new characters. Among the most challenging to animate are Nokk, the water spirit and Gale, the wind spirit. The costumes are very detailed and gorgeous and, even Olaf gets to wear one!The actors from the original cast reprise their roles and Jason Ritter makes his Disney debut as the voice of Ryder. My favorite characters are Brunni, the salamander and Olaf played by Josh Gad. Olaf is very funny and his character becomes bigger in this sequel. My favorite scenes are the ones where the characters are discovering the elements in the forest, because each one represents a new challenge.The message of the film is about creating your own destiny and not being afraid of growing up.I give this film 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 6 to 16, as well as adults. For more reviews by youth visit kidsfirst dot org."
"This film did not meet my expectations.I really enjoyed the first movie but I feel very bored when I watched the second one.Animation is quite cool,musics are good too. But I couldn't feel the story as well. I heard that third movie will come. I hope that it will be much better."
"While the visuals were amazing and I enjoyed all the songs the plot was dreadful.
They tried going so many directions only to end up not answering any new question they brought up and inserting unnecessary information.
They tried to give a lore to the world but did not establish or follow any clear rules regarding it.
Who are the spirits? Do they have a human intellect? Because in the begging it seems like they do and later they just seem like normal animals.
Was Elsa calling herself or was it her dead mother? If her dead mother did have powers and knew what was going on than how come she behaved how she did?
Elsa and Anna's maternal family was stated to be of importance and then never mentioned again. What's up with that?
Are the earth giants the earth spirit? How does that work?
There are many more unclear things about this movie and these are just the ones I can think of on top of my head.
Farther more, only Elsa having any specials powers in a world of otherwise completely normal people only serves to alienate her father to the viewers and cause everything to be more purposeless and confusing. Is she a goddess or a deity now? Is she even human?
The main conflict is also boring. We never felt something or trusted the grandfather in the first place so his betrayal felt boring and we never got to see much or Arrendale so while it caused some emotion due to Anna and Elsa's mild attachment to it, it also didn't feel like a large threat.
There are many more aggravating things which I will not be getting into.
If you are looking forward to a fun watch and don't care much for the plot it's an enjoyable movie that is worth a watch, but it doesn't deserve to be critically acclaimed or highly rated when its plot is so badly written.
The reason that Olaf and Kristof are not mentioned is that they barely had any important role to play in the main plot."
"I'm afraid I'm going to echo the reviews of others here but it is what it is. I had hoped that this film would be better than the first but nope, not happening. While the animation was glorious, the story was just as disjointed (if not more so), than the first. While the general story concept had promise, the actual script felt contrived. The music was pretty but the lyrics were forced. If I had to find a positive in all of this (besides the beauty of the animation), my 2 year old granddaughter really enjoyed it."
"This obviously wasn't as good as the original, but it accomplished that in ways that were surprising. They did it by turning Anna into an obnoxious worrywart and Kristoff a one-dimensional man obsessed with marriage and removing most of Sven's comedy and not using the shopkeeper guy, leaving only Olaf-flavored jokes to bring levity to a dark-toned movie. The songs were too frequent for songs that near-unanimously did not drive or advance the narrative of the movie, and Kristoff's solo was downright cringey. My wife noted that none of the songs seemed to directly reference any of the movie's characters, which seemed like a way to make them coverable by other artists and playable on the radio as none of them were given any details of the movie. Lastly, the characters' eyebrows were physically too long and made them look like they were barely avoiding a unibrow."
Clearly the writer/director is trying at full power to bring back the magic of the original. Unfortunately it still looks like work of a student imitating some masterpiece of the great.
"Everything from character building, music, and story telling was poorly done. Character building was pretty much non-existent, Songs were ok and didn't add much to the story telling other than being a slight irritation, and the Story... well I believe everything that would have made this film exquisite were ultimately taken out. There was no sense of impending doom to any of characters do to poor story telling. With all that Disney was spot on with exquisite animation and stunning visual effects. Sadly this travesty will do quite well solely on the fact it is a continuation of the Frozen series."
Waaaay too much singing. Waaay too much sadness. Not nearly enough humor and use of these wonderful characters.
I was all hyped up to see this movie with my family in the theater and to tell you the truth this movie was not all that great. The main plot was copied from every reverage Disney type movie but the only difference is that this movie included alot of singing. The animation was on point but that was it. While watching this movie the whole time I was saying to myself is this it and I am ready to go. Now the disney creators had well over 7 years to get this right and it seems like they just wanted to make a quick buck off from the first Frozen movie and knew people would go see this one no matter what. Disney needs to do better with their sequels because this was not it. Wait until it comes on demand or DVD.
As I hated the first movie the first I saw but then my friended suggested I watch it again and I liked it actually though it was not like a 9/10 or even 8 it was just worth it and now this one a sequel that's like so overrated I can't believe it what in hell no story line they just showed some ice and water and then bammmm the movies ended and nothing that matters actually happened
"Everything is nonsense and completely disaster
The first movie I can give a 7-8. But this new one is so not like that.
The music is so bad, so bad compared to let it go.
The plot is very plain, and the special effects are not good.
Ughh I want my time back so I can write report instead of going to this annoying film. I hate everything. I can't be in the movie cause it is too bad. And the theatre no one clapped or laughed at all. I felt some people leaving in the middle. The songs are rubbish, the lyrics are empty and the worst."
"Frozen II lacks all the elements that made the original great. Rather than subverting and subtly mocking the traditional ""princess"" movie, this film totally embraces it, cheesy romance and all. One of the best things about the original was that the plot was simple, which allowed the characters to have personality, depth, little quirks that make them real. With Frozen II's more complicated story line, the characters are reduced down to boring, unrelatable placeholders that only exist to reach a goal. They lose many of the traits which audiences loved in the original film.A large part of the movie had to be devoted to backstory, some of which contradicted the original. I understand some changes had to be made to have a more advanced plot, but too much time was spent unlearning things we thought we already knew. Also, I noticed several inconsistencies, such as Anna's eye color, which switched from turquoise/green to bright blue. The man who owned the shop on the mountain is now in Arindelle, which makes no sense considering the distance between the two places. Elsa's entire story line was erased. The whole story of the first film was Elsa accepting her role as Queen. This film ends with her running off to use her powers and making Anna queen, which goes against everything the first film was saying.Although Frozen II was intended to be more complex, the script makes it seem less involved than the first. Gone is the passionate dialogue, the subtle jokes that fly over younger viewers' heads. They made such an effort to bring back all the characters from the original, even if they did nothing for the actual plot. As a result, the movie feels extremely straightforward, to the point where you feel like you're missing something.On the up side, the visuals were absolutely stunning. The animators did a great job with the elements, and I noticed the girls had their hair down, something which was not possible when the first film was made. There were a couple of blips, such as the strap of a bag going through Anna's hair, but that's forgivable, and the animation is definitely the best thing Frozen II has going for it.Finally, there were a couple of things which weren't problems, per say, but they were definitely a little off. First, we have the overused trope of vaguely Native-American type people being in touch with nature and fighting the more ""civilized"" people. Second, the scene where Olaf recounts the entirety of the first movie went on for far too long. I feel like Olaf's entire character wasn't utilized as well as he could have been. Also, what was up with the electric guitar? Don't get me wrong, it sounded awesome, but it didn't really fit with the tone and time period of the actual movies. Finally, we need to talk about Kristoff's song. It felt so out of place, one moment humans are having a conversation, the next, there's spotlights, and closeups and reindeer singing backup vocals. It was weird, and funny, and made me smile, but it was odd in Frozen II. It almost reminded me of an 80s music video.In conclusion, the film tries to go too many directions, which brings down the quality. The songs were good but forgettable, the script was bleak, and the characters were lackluster. The ending erased most of the original movie, Frozen. There was a post-credits scene, but it wasn't worth staying for. See it if you must, but don't expect the heart of the first movie."
"Way too many songs, none of them were catchy like let it go
The water horse didn't make sense and was unexplained
The secondary characters are so forgettable you probably already forgot they existed
The Olaf dying scene was unnecessary, even kids knew he would come back
The most memorable moment of this movie was when it ended I saw like 20 people in the cinema waking up, more than half of the cinema room fall asleep YES ITS THAT BAD."
It's worthy of re-watching. The movie was very good.
"I liked the first film but this sequel is more of the same. It's not bad but doesn't add anything new to the story and sometimes is predictable. The songs are just okay, in my opinion I think the characters could sing less.
Frozen 2 isn't bad, but is away of to be one of the best Disney's films. The children will love but I think there are a lot of better animated movies for adults."
"The new disney animated films just aren't memorable or fun like the old ones and that's not just nostalgia because there are some bad old disney films too like aristcats, great disney films like snow white, cinderella, little mermaid 1989, aladdin 1992 and lion king 1994, and a bugs life and toy story and ants is how you do a 3D animated movie right, but the new disney films like frozen and cars and planes don't live up to the hype, a fun great song from the little mermaid like under the sea or the amazing song a whole new world from aladdin are timeless and then you have the annoying song let it go from frozen from the tipod generation who don't know how to make make a good film, and pushing politics isn't fun either, they need to let that go, just because a movie makes a lot of money dosent mean its great, example, transformers 2 made a lot of money and I don't know anyone who likes that film"
"The cold never bothered me anyway. Most people are likely to know that line came from the mega hit song ""Let it Go"" from the mega hit movie Frozen. In fact, I would think you'd have to know at that point as Frozen has become one of the movies that defied the 2010's with it's cultural significance, large amounts of awards won, large billion dollar box office grossing, and the countless parents that were forced to listen to the soundtrack over and over. Disney has made it their current go-to fairytale and seems to continue marketing it with whatever it can; dresses, toys, shorts, a Broadway musical, and inevitably, a sequel.I personally found the movie very good but not one of the greatest from Disney. I've seen the movie a couple of more times to say my opinion hasn't changed. I don't even know if I would put it in my top ten (Fantasia is still my favorite), but I give it a lot of respect. The movie managed to tell a Disney-like story while trying to show off more character development then before. I'm certainly open to a sequel if it can match the original. Let's see if Frozen II can capture that lightning in a bottle.Queen Elsa (played by Idina Menzel) seems to have found her footing as the ruler of Arendelle, occasionally using her ice powers when needed...usually for entertaining. She has also mended her relationship with her sister Anna (played by Kristen Bell), always grateful that she was saved from her before. Anna continues to be upbeat and his happy with her boyfriend Kristoff (played by Jonathan Groff), reindeer Sven, and talking snowman Olaf (played by Josh Gad). All is well until a mysterious voice starts to call out to Elsa. When she tries to follow it, Arendelle faces a force in nature to cause the people to evacuate.Elsa is advised that the answer to voice will be found in the mysterious forest to the north where the previous king had visited before. Anna, Kristoff and Olaf insist on coming too, so they venture to the north why they find an unbreakable fog blocking their entrance. They do make it in, discovering a magical forest where a tribe of people that connect with nature live, along with an Arendelle army led by Destin (played by Sterling K. Brown) have been trapped. Elsa and Anna find a bigger history to their kingdom that might change the sisters forever.Frozen II attempts to tell a much bigger story then before and I have to give it respect for that. It's fine if you want to tell a more complex story, but the problem is that it needs complex characters to go with it. Elsa and Anna are still likable and seem to go through each of their journeys fine, but it also hit me that their personalities seems to be back at square one from the first movie. Elsa is still a loner and Anna is still too open with her emotions. Wouldn't they have grown a little since the first movie?My other problem happens to be a large one and that's the location. I'm all up for a change in scenery, but Frozen knew how to balance out the darker moments with the light. Frozen II seems to be more about the dark, which means were in the enchanted forest most of the time, and it's a very dreary and depressing place to be. You can shoot out as many magic ice beams as you want, but with it's more purple and grey setting, this is a rare scenario where I think more upbeat moments were needed.It's not an all bad movie as there are some good things about it. All the voice acting is still great. The animation is better then the first. Some of the visuals like the water horses, various ice sculptures and more mythic settings are pretty to look at. Many of the songs are good, though not as iconic as ""Let it Go"". I'd say that both songs by Idina Menzel like ""Into the Unknown"" and ""Show Yourself"" are great. The others are fine, but Kristoff's song ""Lost in the Woods"" has an odd 80's power ballad feel which is not only out of place, but adds nothing to the story. It'll probably get a lot of feedback on the car radio, but parents can rest assured that none of them are going to be repeated for the next six years.I'll give this five ice horses out of ten. Will Frozen II be a hit? Probably. Is it as good as the first? Definitely not. I don't think I'd watch this again on my own, but if I had kids, I wouldn't see a problem. What Disney needs to remember that perhaps asking what happens after ""happily ever after"" is not the best thing. I've never seen Frozen as a long series, so let's see if people think they should let it go."
"Frozen I was a great movie
Frozen II was a grandiose movie. The story literally lead my friend and I into the unknown; both of us didn't understand it at all.Music is okay but not that impressive. No story line at all. It's a good movie for anyone who only want to watch Elsa sing for 100 minutes."
Nearly all films by Disney have felt magical and amazing. This film seems to lack this. The soundtrack was so bad I don't remember a single song from the film (the first frozen. you would have at least one stuck in your head). Really disappointed.
"Frozen 2 is somewhat of a bust. A cash grab to make money for Disney, and the cast. It has a muddled half-baked epic journey environmental plot. Not very involving in the way it is carried out.What made the original special, such as plot, music, character development, and relationships, are regurgitated without wonderment, and spirit.Olaf and Sven, as the comic relief are redeeming factors and are entertaining.The music is alright but pails in comparison to the original. The songs are not all that memorable.The animation is beautiful, one of the best looking animated films I have seen in a long time.The movie is made for kids and not adults. Children will probably be satisfied and enjoy it. Some fans of Frozen, will be letdown going in with high expectations hoping this one tops the original that so many people love.Toy Story 4 is a movie I liked more that was released the same year as Frozen 2. It is more complex and layered in the way the characters are written and developed, and the story makes more sense.Even though there was a long gap of time between Frozen and Frozen 2 it still felt rushed. I wanted a movie that was more consequential and captivating, and I didn't get it from this sequel."
"From the visual effect. Like usual notthing can beat Disney.
But from the story line. It has lost its magic. The first movie is far stronger to enchant you. The first movie will be in your head for years. And this movie will be in your head for two weeks. Or maybe you will forget it only in a week.
Maybe it is only for me. But this movie keeps giving you music nonstop. Some are really good. Some are just not that good. Or you will think why that scene needs a singing scene.Overall it is a good movie. But not as good as the first one. Don't expect too much."
"I'm not sure what happened in this sequel, but the entire movie had a depressing feel to it. It also tried to pack a lot in. There were too many competing storylines. I didn't find it particularly enjoyable or fun to watch. The songs weren't catchy and all but one were depressing.It did have a lot of beautiful visual effects, but overall not fun and memorable like the first."
"Spoiler alert!!!!!!I just didn't enjoy the movie and felt depressed after seeing it. Sure the animation was beautiful but the movie was missing heart. The songs were not very good and felt forced.I feel like it should have a trigger warning. As someone that has recently experienced a lot of death recently, this movie made me feel really bad. I'm mean, what's up with that Olaf scene!! People were getting up and leaving!I know it's all about change and is suppose to have a deeper meaning, but it seriously missed the mark. This is a Disney movie that is suppose to entertain and inspire small children! WTH!I just don't see children wanting to watch it a million times. I don't see karaoke versions of the songs sang by children hitting YouTube anytime soon."
The dose of the intimate love is exaggerated and killed the course of the storytelling. The first one was more interesting if we only focus on intimate relationship. Very poor scenario tried to compensated by unnecessary music breaks.
"I kinda liked the original, and the animation here is superb. In fact, never have cartoon females looked so good! Now, I will say this - too many songs spoil a film, and at times I was rolling my eyes as another character opened up for a tune. I mean, focus on the story. It made a bit of sense, but it needed more weight. At least we get to see how Elsa's feet looked like!"
"Did Walt Disney make/produce 'Snow White 2'? No; he did not. Nor did Walt spend (waste) his resources on '2's (seconds) of his visionary/groundbreaking classics including Dumbo, Fantasia. Pinnochio, and Mary Poppins.😑😣"
"I had high hopes for this movie to be honest. I'm not the biggest fan of the first movie but that one seems like a masterpiece compared to this.
What was the point of Elsa accepting her role as the Queen in the first movie if she was just going to live in a magical forest at the end?
I get that they tried to give her powers a backstory but it just feels so forced and off, the worldbuilding they tried to do doesn't feel natural.
It felt like there were so many things missing, there was no evil that had to be defeated, no big character arc, nothing. Everything happened so fast and then it was just over. The entire movie acts like there's gonna be this big climax that's gonna make everything worthwhile but that doesn't happen."
"Frozen II has bland songs that try to copy themselves from the original Frozen film. Singers who sing in the Frozen II film have depressingly limited vocal range when they sing except for maybe Idina Menzel. Elsa, the main character that is played by Idina Menzel herself, does almost the same things that she did in the original Frozen film, but the writer(s) changed the storyline very slightly. If you pay attention to the storyline in Frozen II, everything almost happens the same way like in the original Frozen film except for the deeper story of Elsa and Anna's parents, a deeper story to explain why Elsa has magical powers, Anna saving the day by breaking the dam, Elsa finding a new pet kind of how Anna and Elsa find a new friend like Olaf, and Anna and Elsa meeting characters who were part of their parents' past. Other than that, Frozen II has an overwhelmingly predictable storyline if you think really hard about it. A character named Olaf in this film was the saving grace of this film because Olaf was the one that tried to make this depressingly predictable film with banal songs have some positive spirit in it. Elsa's new pet didn't even have any personality in it despite it looking cute, having a magical power, and licking its own eyes. I think this film will definitely sell a lot of souvenirs such as toys, clothes, books, and other things that are based on the Frozen 2 film once Disney starts selling them. Kids are definitely going to put the film Frozen 2 and the profitable souvenirs based on Frozen 2 on their Christmas list next year. But, Frozen 2 is pretty lame with a silly storyline compared to the original Frozen film and it's aimed for the kid demographic instead of the adult demographic. So I won't be surprised if impulsive adults and kids like Frozen 2."
"Frozen I had such an amazing story arc. Characters were introduced and developed well, jokes were well placed, and the music really enhanced the movie. The movie built up to such a wonderful and touching ending which was a fresh take on typical Disney films. The same cannot be said for Frozen II. The most glaring flaw is the music. A new song is introduced almost every 15 minutes that is not only not melodic, but doesn't serve any real purpose. The jokes are horribly placed and arbitrary. Characters change moods every half hour (one minute they're happy, next their fighting, then they love each other again). Finally the ending was terribly anticlimactic. It ends abruptly and in way that makes you go ""that's it?"" As it was with The Lion King, Disney has spent all their budget on visual effects and not enough on story. A huge disappointment."
"First frozen movie was a success because it was out of ordinary it was little bit different and the story was heart warming !!!
This sequel fails because it tries to do the same thing in exactly the same way!, and becomes very predictable and boring!
Good visuals and sound actors are not enough tho save the movie.it is still good enough for children though !!!"
"I am a Disney fan but in this one they disappointed me. For animation 5/5 superb as always, for music 0/5, too many songs, not enough rhythm or proper lyrics, too many bad songs misplaced and crowded the movie, even my 8 yrs old niece was bored of it. The story seemed rushed and too many scenes reminded me of Bollywood movies, so thin so amplified to point of loss of meaning. And enough with the make-up, too much make up distorts young girl's image of beauty, and Elsa's make up is so heavy she looks like a disco queen! This story is set in Nordic times (1839) yet this movie makes it set in 2019! Sure it is a visual feast but very little substance or intellect that my 14 yr old other niece found it to be unnecessary compared to the original."
"What do you know. Disney decides to unnecessarily preach to us about reparations, while dangling it's liberal propaganda in our faces and then distracting us with witty humor. Leave your agendas out of the movies. It is getting so ridiculous."
"Plot was rubbish, charcters were charcter-less. Unmeaningful and the voice overs didnt match the charcters attiude. Overall absolute garbage."
"Well I found that the animation was extremely well done, with tones of details and this was a definite result of the budget and the mahouts that were put in however the story was less than fitting of such incredible craftsmanship. The entire story was all circumstance and week at best, and to compare to its predecessor it felt like the characters were going through the motions where as with Frozen the story was unraveling.It almost felt like the filmmakers didn't know where the story was going, there was poor character development and the relationships felt forced with a seemingly unnatural chemistry. The once power couple that was ""Kristna"" or ""Anoff"" seemed to have lost their spark and as a result of this Kristoff feels as though marriage is the answer.Another part of the film that just felt missing was the iconic presence of original songs. Song after Song seemed to melt into each other sounding as if they were different lyrics placed over the same melody.To sum it all up I am only giving this film a 6/10 because I think it was lacking everything that made the first movie such an international success."
"Animations were obviously better, but that's expected. It's been 6 years since the first movie came out. If it wasn't better, then shame on Disney for scamming young kids. The songs sounded good, but since I felt that none of them surpassed Let It Go, I can't give them more stars for that. This falls into the category of sequels unable to live up to their expectations alongside Mulan II, Hunchback of Notre Dame II, and etc. It's a good movie for the kids since all they want to see is Elsa and Anna. It's also good at the female empowerment section since it was mainly the two independent female characters that dictated the entire movie. However, as a movie, I felt like something was missing the entire time. It felt like something happened, but nothing happened at the same time. There was no substance in the movie. Overall, extremely disappointed and would only recommend others to watch if you're finding an excuse to eat some popcorn or if you just want to kill time."
"It seemed like Disney had 50 songs in the vault they needed to use before they lost the rights to them and so they used 14 of them in this movie. The story was good, but it was lost DEEP in the soundtrack."
How can anybody make such a nonsensical animation movie?? I mean what was the whole point? The story was so forced from the beginning. They forced it down our throat. Writing a review for the first time. Dont go!!
"99% music
1% movieFirst frozen was better
I don't recommend this movie"
"Frozen II (2019)I seriously do not understand the ratings this disappointment is getting. No outstanding songs and a convoluted plot no child, (Not to mention a lot of adults) could follow. Sure Olof is cute but he's pretty much the highlight of this movie. My wife's a kindergarten/ preschool teacher and she was disappointed too. Don't waste your money."
"Yeah, so Frozen II was a BIIIIIG let down for me. My biggest issue was the plot, or lack thereof. I found myself excruciatingly bored throughout most of the movie. Yeah, there's a strange voice calling to Elsa, but so what? Why do I care? Why should I care? Give me a dang reason to care about what's happening!Good plots introduce a conflict and then build upon that conflict, developing the story around that conflict, which often grows in severity, and then ultimately culminates during the climax after which the conflict is resolved. Frozen followed this formula. The initial conflict was introduced right away during the first scene, the tragic incident which separates the sisters. The rest of the movie is Anna trying to reconnect with Elsa. Not only is that an interesting conflict it makes for a compelling plot through the rest of the movie. In a good story we know what the stakes are and we are rooting for the characters to achieve their goal. In this case, Anna wants to reunite with her sister and we desperately want that for her too! We are emotionally invested in what's happening!Another sign of a good plot is how it builds upon the initial incident (a.k.a. inciting incident). Frozen did this well. The coronation party shows their desire to reconnect but yet another wedge is driven between them. So Anna treks to the north mountain where she encounters more obstacles, seemingly insurmountable ones, to get what she desires. In the end, it looks like all is lost as Hans leaves Anna to die and comes within a hair's breadth of killing Elsa. It's a close call, but with Anna's own sacrifice the conflict is finally resolved and the characters achieve their goal...Anna and Elsa are reunited!Frozen II has no clear initial incident with which to introduce a primary conflict. This neuters the entire story. The conflict that is there doesn't serve to advance the plot or build on any initial incident. Almost the entire movie is just Elsa wanting to figure out who is calling her and a bunch of random events that happen to her along the way. We as the audience have no idea what the stakes are and we have no real reason to root for the characters. That's because no compelling conflict was ever introduced, and with no compelling conflict the entire movie ends up being kinda boring.I also think Kristoff's character was wasted in this film. He doesn't do a single thing to contribute to the plot, as meager as it was, and does nothing to further the story. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed his proposal struggles, but characters who don't serve to advance the plot are poorly written, imo. This whole movie was poorly written. That's because they promoted the original writer, Jennifer Lee, to president or something, so she doesn't have time to write scripts anymore. What a tragedy."
"Boring. Good visuals but way too much singing. It was good when the singing stopped but that was rare.
My kids did not care for it either. Good rental movie"
"Frozen II is a fair effort. I appreciate the more mature approach and it continues the story rather than being a blatant rehash, but the results are ultimately formulaic and lacking an impact. Granted, it goes down some intriguing and heartrending paths but cops out at the last second for an obligatory happy ending and it doesn't seem like any lessons are learned or sacrifices are made at all. The characters seek something, there are obstacles, TA-DA they succeed. Nothing really to take in value. Just the hero's journey done at the simplest.The comedy, as opposed to its predecessor, is especially weak. I adored Olaf before. He wasn't annoying as he whispered most of his quips and was kind of a naive goof with his heart in the right place, which resulted in a lot of innocent laughs. In the sequel, he is OBNOXIOUS. The filmmakers relied too heavily on him as the comedic relief and hardly anything he said or did had me cracking a smile. He is beyond try-hardy and really harms the film's attempt to be more grounded and dark in tone. I just wanted to blast a flamethrower to him. The new characters are also not very interesting. They lack charm and purpose and are overall just not fun to watch.On the other hand, the animation is absolutely breathtaking. Some of the sequences are a Fantasia level of brilliance. The scene from the trailer where Elsa is braving the ocean with her ice powers...AMAZING. Probably the best sequence in the whole film. It's riveting, stressful and nothing I would expect out of Frozen. I just wish the trailer didn't give its presence away. It would've been a more genuine surprise. That is one of many sequences though. The story may be lukewarm, but the visuals aren't and I highly recommend seeing the film for the animation alone. The songs, while not memorable, are delightful enough and do a fine job furthering the narrative and expressing how the characters feel. I just don't see myself humming them in the near future.Another detail I need to praise is Disney's continuing effort to push away villains and make the narrative's more driven by character. That's right, like Ralph Breaks the Internet, Frozen II doesn't have a set villain. The antagonist is the truth and the story is the character's attempt to brave it and make a better world because of it. Sadly that part doesn't leave a very satisfactory punch. Still, it's nice to see that Disney is responding to the criticism regarding their villains because we were getting downright sick of the surprise reveals. There doesn't always have to be a bad guy. A character's struggles or insecurities are compelling enough. In all, Frozen II is definitely an inferior follow-up. Has some of the best animation Disney has to offer and I give it big points for that - I was genuinely taken aback by the beauty of it - but the film could've used a more grounded rewrite to give it a lasting effect."
"Disappointing! The story is not engaging at all. Unnecessarily complicated plot just for the sake to make it considered as ""a movie"". The humor is also dry.Too many songs sung during the movie but none of them is as nice as ""Let It Go"". Boring...boring...Now I understand why the rating of this movie is below the first one and I expect I will be getting lower."
"Frozen 2 is the continuation of the first Frozen film six years later. The film is directed and partly written by Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee, who also directed the first part.In the film, Else (voice of Idina Menzel) is queen of Arendelle. When she hears mysterious voices and singing, she wonders if this is due to her ice forces, or if this is a sign of danger to her kingdom. She decides to investigate on her own where the voices come from and what they mean. Her sister Anna (voice of Kristen Bell) and snowman Olaf (voice of Josh Gad) want to help Elsa with her mission, but Elsa ensures that she can go on her own mission. Anna and Olaf still try to come to Elsa to help her, but they have to find their way through the mysterious autumn forest without Elsa her magical ice forces. Kristoff (voice of Jonathan Groff) and his reindeer Sven also try to find Anna so that he can ask her to marry him.
With the first Frozen film, the Walt Disney Animation studio managed to make a good animation film again with its own suitable music and songs in the front of the film. This film also had a story for the entire family. The film managed to interest and entertain both parents and children. This was due to the use of some story elements from the Disney classic animation film The Lion King. They had adapted this to use it in a modern way in the first Frozen film. This second Frozen film unfortunately loses its family theme and only retains the children's theme, because for adult viewers the story of this second film can seem somewhat predictable. Younger children are less likely to see the film's revelations until they are brought forward by the film itself. Due to various events in the film, the group falls apart during the film, so that each character almost gets his or her own separate storyline in this new film. All these separate story lines ensure that the film as a whole appears a bit too messy. This film will only remain entertaining for younger children or adults who are really fans of Frozen and would like to see a new film with the same characters. For a better family film, it is better to watch the first Frozen film with your family again. For a better continuation of the first Frozen film, adults and older children can better watch the fourth season of the TV series Once Upon a Time.Fortunately, the film still has nice animation images. Elsa knows how to use her ice forces to create beautiful ice animation forms and images in the film. The new elements and characters that come from the mysterious forest also provide beautiful animation moments in the film. The film also has beautiful new music and songs that will linger in your head for a while, but they are not as good as the songs from the first film. This film, for example, does not have such a catchy number as Let It Go. The comedy in the film is also entertaining, but also seems to be more intended for a younger audience. For older viewers, certain comedy moments can also seem somewhat predictable.The voice and singing work is well done by the cast. The characters also work well together in the film. It is a shame that they have decided to separate the characters during the film, because the characters on their own seem less fun and interesting."
"Frozen 1 was much better. Frozen 2 has confusing story, lots of plot holes, unnecessary new characters with no backstory, and lots of annoying songs. Frozen 1 didn't have many songs like this one. There is one song every 5 minutes like wtf.Graphics are nice but story makes no sense. How did Arendelle exist before the dam was built? Why did they build the dam? Why did Elsa' grandfather attack the tribe leader? Why did Elsa freeze? Why destroying the dam sets Elsa free? Why does Elsa have to stay in the Northuldra? What is Ahtohallan and what does it really do? So many unanswered questions. This film may entertain young children but it fails to entertain more mature audience. Story is a huge mess and it is just another commercial movie, amde to earn money. Another big disappointment from Disney, no surprise. Totally useless sequel, this movie ruined this franchise. I will not consider it as Frozen's sequel."
Nothing really changes from the first to the second movie. Frozen II doesn't give the audience any reason to feel afraid for the characters. The plot holes are 30 something years wide. Hard to follow unless you don't think about many parts of the story. Play is the best part.
"I'm 34 years old. I loved the first one. Saw it three times in theaters. Immediately bought the soundtrack afterward.The first one had me on my toes the whole time. The story progressed smoothly. The songs had purpose. The theme of ""let it go"" was relatable.This sequel had none of that. They stuff a contrived story down your throat - having to explain everything at each step because nothing made sense. The songs are totally forgettable and filler. There is no meaningful conflict and the climax is non-existent.A real shame."
"Its not a bad movie. But when you have an epic movie like the first Frozen, you expect at least a very good sequel. Not this one.
Not even one great song. The first is full of them.
Not a very interesting story... and very dark movie (literally. Too much dark scenerios).
But well, Olaf is always great!"
"Watching Frozen 2 was like - the most avoidable experience ever. It has neither story nor song, neither logic nor emotion. It seemed as if the story teller went on leave and told his typist /proof reader to write the sequel. It is always difficult for a sequel to live up to an original hit story but this was egregiously bad.
Don't waste your time. Rewatch Frozen."
"Frozen 2 - thumbs down. Such a bad movie. Which is really sad since I am a big fan of Frozen 1. I really need to try to forget this movie, it never existed, since it destroys everything good and all the important things made during the first movie. The story is so forced, there's no motivation to do things(the turning point music of the movie is played almost right at the beginning, without any cause/or payoff, horrible Kristoff Song, characters that don't make any sense, Anna being super annoying, and the list goes on. If you love Frozen, do yourself a favor and avoid this one. This is why Disney shouldn't make sequels. Even the songs were bad!Also great messaging for your kids, like breaking promises is good!"
"This sequel really sucks big time.The songs are poorly written
The plot sucksAnd theres nothing exciting about it.
Feels like they are just pushing this cartoon for the money.Dont waste your time watching this.
Save your money."
"The animation is gorgeous. The history, well it lacks a real history. There wasn't any song as good as the ones in the first movie (my daughter's didn't ask for the soundtrack)."
"Very disappointing, this movie was pretty boring and was so dark. It just dragged on and on, making no sense at all. Granted, these movies always have some type of ""magic"" in them but they went way off the deep end with this one, focusing on the ""spirits"" and powers and just didn't make any sense. A lot more singing then the last one and a very depressing song that was shocking they would even put that in there with the depression issues the youth deal with these days. Overall, this movie was way worse the first one, quite surprising they went this way, boring and stupid story line. The first one was cute even though a little weird but this one was totally lame. The whole ""me"" power theme with her ""finding her powers in herself"" is ridiculous and hearing voices and following spirits. A lot of dark magic stuff, worse then any of these movies I have seen and it was constant throughout the whole movie. Not worth wasting almost $30 in a theater for two people. If anything, wait till it gets out on video, you aren't missing anything. Wish I wouldn't have even wasted my time to see this."
My kids enjoyed it so at least was good.I walked in having listened to the soundtrack and not liking the music so I was probably tainted from the get go but since the music is a big part of this movie it makes an impact. The story of convoluted and uninspiring. The visuals are amazing as to be expected. Don't think we'll be making multiple trips to the theater for this uninspiring sequel.
"To say this film was terrible would be harsh. My two girls loved it and it was fun and ideally that is what it is meant to do. Speaking from an adults perspective though, it just lacked everything the first did, and was trying to hard to mimic what was right about the first. The singing was abit much and seemed forced as if they where trying to find a new let it go and it's clear they saw the pound signs from the original they just knocked up a story line with plot holes galore just to cash in! That being said I remind myself it is only a kids film and I do not expect a shawshank redemption storyline! It is fun and well worth taking the kids"
"The movie wasn't as good as the first Frozen, in which I thought was a very good movie. It was a weak film, I feel like it was all thrown together all too quickly and most of the time, there was just too much happening. The comedy was a bit broken, I think I only laughed once but the movie had some interesting outcomes.
Altogether, I did not really enjoy this film.
Disney, please don't try a third..."
"Frozen 2 is really a huge disappointment. Confusing plot, too many songs and all of them are not outstanding at all, characters become so boring, bland and fake. Dreams work's ""Abominable"" is so much more better: funny, warmth hearted and magical. Don't waste money watching Frozen 2, better to watch Abominable with the cute Yeti."
"I mean, just WOW, best animated picture of the year,, amazing sequel. After so many flops (for me) from disney, they now actually delievers something exquisite!!"
"Disney Sequels are an interesting conundrum. Almost every single Disney Movie sequel was produced by a different film studio (DisneyToon Studios) who gave us some terrible direct to video Disney Sequels such as Return of Jafar, Little Mermaid 2, and Fox and the Hound II. As of now only 4 Disney films have been given sequels made by Walt Disney Animation (Rescuers Down Under, Winnie the Pooh, Ralph Breaks the Internet, and Frozen II) Each Sequel is without a doubt better than the direct to video films, but as of right now This is the best of that bunch. Frozen II has a script and story that is much better than the first and actually gives heart and depth to a lot of our characters. Kristen Bell and the Wickedly Talented Idina Menzel give astounding vocal performances, and Josh Gad even made me cry. Though only time will tell how the songs fair to the public, I believe Frozen II is a sequel that could've been much worse, (and probably should have been) but it goes above and beyond and I don't think anyone will be Letting Go anytime soon."
Skip It and keep the memories of the original frozen intact. Only good part was Olaf and his humour.
"Wooden dialogue was otherwise we'll delivered. An excessive number of outright bad songs (with only one exception) were none the less well sung.Character arcs and motivations were rudimentary, though at least they were not out-of-character. Yet the overall narrative barely held together as a coherent story, from its entirely literal call to adventure then through one contrived conflict and convenient solution after another, ending a series of underwhelming climaxes.Poor writing was the problem, the screenwriting and the songwriting. There were decent ideas throughout the film that consistently failed in their implementation. It made for a film trying but failing to punch well above it's weight, more like a direct-to-video Aladdin sequel with higher production values then the unexpected breakout success of Frozen."
"The main problem with the first Frozen was it's failure to entertain adults. Most excellent children's movies in the past decade have found clever ways to slip in jokes or themes that adults can enjoy. Frozen II continues the theme of failure to entertain adults, but also performs worse in its specialization. The music wasn't quite as catchy, the plot as enticing, or the characters as funny. All this being said, your 4 year old will go bonkers for it."
Just the same as the last one.... Except it's forgettable which is a plus. Olaf is the worst thing ever.
"After I watched the first part of Frozen I was amazed, now I am disappointed.DON""T GO!!!!!!!!"
"My son asked to go see it. It was simply not as entertaining as the first. There are a lot of unnecessary songs that will be terrible to hear over and over. The echoing (beckoning) noise was getting annoying. It seemed pretty dark compared to the first. The graphics were really good. My son asked about an our into it how much longer it had. When he asked toward the end and I told him he had about 10 minutes left, he was excited it was almost over. I wouldn't want to sit through it again."
"Disney spent a ton of money on visuals, sound, and production, but the storyline and script seems rushed, haphazard, and even downright unprofessional! When you have to cringe at the writing multiple times during the movie, something is amiss. The overall plot failed to excite or inspire me, and songs seemed shoehorned in and pass-by barely noticed. While the songs sounded good enough, they failed to add anything to the story, and none of them seem memorable at first listen. This is sad because I know it's the same writers as the brilliant Coco and the first Frozen. All in all the story makes it feel like a typical ""sequel"" - and it a good example of why 'sequels' get a bad name. This is certainly no Empire Strikes Back - and unfortunately that was what we all were hoping for."
"The long awaited sequel to Frozen is finally here. To bad they made such a terrible job of it. They didn't have enough ideas for a story line so they filled three quarters of the film with strange and forgettable songs.
The storyline is as thin as tussuepaper and not surprising. We have seen this before. Even the kids didn't like the movie.
To bad Disney, this is a waste of time and money."
"The good:
We watched it in 3D at the theater. Very nice to watch that way. Olaf was funnier than in the first and saved the day. The idea of paying respect to natives and native origins was nice.The bad:
The plot was too busy and there were many holes (or at least some things weren't made very clear). The insertion of natives into the original Frozen story felt forced and didn't seem natural. Too confusing for kids of any age (or even adults for that matter). I wouldn't watch it again. They could have kept the whole plot much simpler and more digestible for children.The ugly:
Children don't need to know about some ugliness of the past and I didn't like the fact that the young characters felt they had the responsibility of making right the wrongs of their ancestors.Like many others said here, not bad to see on big screen in 3D (like any other film), but nothing special."
"What the heck? Seemed avant garde in both the storytelling as well as the musicality. Some beautiful animation of course, but the story seemed rather complicated and confusing for children. Felt a bit all over the place and lacking the straightforward 'Let It Go' mentality. If Frozen was a 9/10 then I have to give this one closer to a 5. Certainly it held some redemption in its attempt to portray the horrors of colonial injustice."
"Let me start by saying I'm much more forgiving when Disney are inspired by classical stories than when they try and retell them their own way. So Frozen and its sequel, are better in my personal book than Mary Poppins, Peter Pan Beauty and the Beast and a few other Disney versions of the classics. But this is just a point I wish to make before discussing the movie itself.As for the movie itself, it's a nice one, it has some very impressive voice acting performances, with Josh Gad, topping the list, probably because he's written down as a scene stealer to begin with. But all of the other roles of the leading trio are performed superbly. The story is a bit convoluted, and suffers from too many stops for songs, which makes me think that Disney were looking for another Let It Go but couldn't be certain which of the songs will hit the mark so they left them all in. They also had the recent global warming issues driving the film a bit too strongly, so they ended up being a bit too preachy. So here goes 8 stars instead of 9 or even 10. Other aspects of the story are well written, the characters do some growing in front of our eyes, which is nice to see, it even delves into some deep issues of right wrong, fear as a reason for actions and obviously - making peace with nature.So here we go, a nice movie with some annoying faults, go see it, and make your own judgement."
"I really enjoyed the animation of the movie, the graphics and visual effects are almost perfect, but the story is kind of boring, not as good as the first movie was, also the songs are not the best, I only liked the first lullaby."
Yea we all know disney has some propaganda inside them but maybe this time even more
"Frozen 2 will be enjoyed by kids so you should probably take them to see it! Lots of songs and princessy stuff, cute characters etc etc.
Frozen 2 does not live up to the legacy of the original. It feels like they have thrown the characters into the mythology of a different movie that they wanted to create but figured it would be easier to sell it as established franchise Frozen. The 'twist' is seen coming from a mile away. The emotional feels are lacking and/or feel contrived. Some of the animation is very well done, especially the 'water' effects. It's a cashgrab."
"This movie makes the mistake of choosing a cliche theme which is typical of Disney movie. I'm a sucker for Disney movies and this one did not stick. Elsa's character did not develop while Anna's developed too rapidly. In comparison to the first the music is worse and there is no epic euphoric ballads like ""Let it Go"". Additionally this movie tries to appeal to teens and children leaving it in a weird spot for plot. I just wish they fully committed to the darker side to spice things up. Overall, I consider this movie to be better than average do to the stunning visuals and strong (yet cliche) theme. 6= better than avg. for me."
"The saddest part for my kids is that Elsa would send Anna off in a frozen sled (which almost ends up killing her twice), after Anna reminded her they were going to work together. Perhaps it would have been boring for Anna to watch Elsa from the beach, but at least you wouldn't be disgusted with Elsa for leaving both Anna and Kristoff behind. The movie is so disconnected and angsty and fragmented, I'm just disappointed."
"My children would give it a 9/10. The story was mediocre. The way the story was told is hit or miss. It seemed convoluted, with songs put in places just to increase the length of the movie although some did not seem to fit. Frozen 1 was much better."
"We cried, we sang, we were engaged. The story is warm and rounded: the search for the truth from the past by our two beloved sisters.
The songs are rampant, earthy and satisfying, and the colours and laughter enthral.
Ignore the jaded critics, this is a wonderful film.
A little more age in the audience was evident, but we have all grown up a few years since the explosive first film. Let's celebrate how wonderful a fairytale can be, and right the wrongs of the past generation!"
"For as much time Disney had to complete this film...its actually disappointing to see such a weak script. The songs weren't as memorable/emotional as the first.On the bright side, Olaf, once again, has saved the day."
"Animation : stuning like always
Storyline : 5 minutes talking, 10 minutes singing and dancing and so on until the movie ends, too much singing it's like i watch bollywood movie. More serious then the first movie and i think it's not suitable for children or it's kinda boring for children"
The story was great (especially that great Olaf scene) and the music was once again a hit. Good job to the team
"Unfortunately an unnecessary sequel with a poorly written script and plenty of logical inconsistencies. The characters and the music are good as always, but the story was just atrocious in my opinion. Also I absolutely hated the ending, at first it seemed like they were going to do something daring and different, which really got me into the film, but then they just take it back by the end, because of course it's a Disney kids animated movie. This film was just not for me, but kids and parents will absolutely love it."
What a disappointment! Too many mediocre songs and not enough Story.
Yucky movie. Very dark and disturbing and had an overload of magic. I'm sad I wasted my money on this movie as well as my time.
Story telling seems very abrupt and does not logically lead you to the climax. Personally I thought it had one too many songs as well which was pausing the story from time to time. Full marks for animation but overall doesn't live up to the mark left by by the 1st part.
"Lovely animation but storyline really did not appeal. I think they overdid the Olaf scenes. He is cute but a little too much is just that, TOO much."
"I love frozen First but not the sequel, I think without olaf this movie will be boring. For young kids may be fine but for an adult, it wasn't."
"Are simply tone deaf and completely missing the point. You are adults ripping apart a movie that is made for kids, and if you had children you'd understand that it's not about your enjoyment, it's about theirs. And I had a wonderful time watching my daughter laugh and sing and laugh some more - thats the point. And Olaf has some hilarious quotes ""Samantha? I don't even know a Samantha!"" Lol now that's hilarious."
"Not just weak story, it is stolen too, boooring! Why they made this ... ?"
"I guess the movie is pleasant enough at face value, if you have no sense of history or critical thinking skills. The music was highly derivative of Frozen II and one number was mind-numbingly juvenile. My main problem was with the plot. SPOILER: It literally made no sense that the unnamed gods would call to Elsa to travel a great distance to save a land, where the native inhabitants had to power to save themselves the whole time. It was a lesson in the obligation of ""White Man's burden."" It literally makes the case that if you have a problem, wait for your savior to come (even if it takes 34 yrs), rather than people learning to help themselves immediately. Were there NO people of color in the room when they wrote, pitched, and developed the story for production? Plus, why would Elsa and Anna's mom keep secret that she was supernatural, when she knew that her daughter had abilities - or when she was older? Instead, she sang a song with metaphoric clues to them as young children. So much of this movie just made no sense. I wish I could have had this conversation with Disney."
Went to see Frozen 2 with my Niece yesterday and I absolutely loved it. I thought it was better than the 1st. My niece loved it but not as much as the 1st. But the reviews of 3s and 4s are just ridiculous and simply not honest
"Obviously the sequel holds a strong standing on the basis of Frozen's height but in my opinion it would have shine alone without any problem because the story, direction and concept work is really satisfying. We got a beautiful history of Elsa and Anna's family with some twists and turns.
The movie gave a beautiful account of Elsa's will power and decision of her own. The most fabulous part of this story is you will never feel that a single character is focussed more because all characters were given their times."
"Frozen 2 had so much going for it: great characters, amazing musical talent, outstanding effects and animation, some solid concepts, and...it failed to deliver. Some musical numbers proceeded events which seemed to provide the necessary context and motivation for the song; others followed events but seemed insufficiently related to or motivated by the events. Lots of interesting ideas and scenes which didn't flow or transition well. Ultimately it felt like a movie which was shipped incomplete and unfinished."
"Firstly, I was looking forward to seeing the film as I love Disney and was expecting a sweet movie at the very least. That was definitely not what I got. The plot was extremely messy with poor writing! It was very hard to follow and didn't make sense for the most part. The music wasn't catchy or even well written, it was a major disappointment. The only saving grace was Olaf's character development which was well done and cristofs solo which was hilarious. Apart from that the movie felt really lacking."
"I took my niece to see this yesterday and the conversation we had before we went in was about in the first movie how needy, insecure, over protective, vulnerable, dramatic and love starved Anna was of her sister Elsa in Frozen 1 and she hoped that this movie will be different. NOPE - Anna is even worse in this movie to the point it gets very irritating! Elsa can't breath without Anna asking if she's okay! Is this really this message we are telling our children - To completely smoother your siblings in love and attention to the point they want to run away! Besides that, some of the songs are catchy but there were far too many. They literally break into a song every like 10-12 minutes. The animation was great, the storyline was average and predictable. Disney went over the top with the moral aspect of this movie but I guess that's the way all Disney movies seem to be going now. Children under 12 will probably love this movie. Older children may find it predictable and boring."
The songs and singing were unmemorable. The plot left much to be desired. Some cute parts strung together but the movie didn't succeed with the feeling and fun of the first. Felt like Disney needed a fast buck.
"The worst script writing in an animation I have ever seen, with awful lines such as 'let me see what I can see', and 'i love you with all that i am'.
Not to mention how the story line and plot was all over the place, and half the characters that were relevent and loved in the first film, are now completly and utterly irrelevent in the sequel."
"It was an okay movie. It probably didn't really need to be made. It wasn't particularly bad, but it wasn't that great either. This movie probably has about as many songs as the first, but it seems like most of the songs were bunched up in the beginning of the movie, which I feel messed with the pacing of the movie. Also, pretty much all of the songs are forgettable. ""Into the Unknown"" has grown on me a bit, but none of the songs really compare to the ones in the first movie. Also, Olaf, to me, is one of the most irritating characters ever created. He seems to get more screen time in this one, which again, is a minus to me.I will say that the animation is excellent, but that's about the only area where it excelled. The story seemed a bit rushed. New characters were introduced, but they weren't really developed. They were kind of just there. I probably will watch it again to see if it grows on me, but I doubt this one will have the impact that its predecessor had."
"So, I bought early tickets for this movie, and it was over $100. I went into the theatres on November 21st with very, VERY high expectations for this movie. I watched through the entire movie without shedding a single tear, but this movie's emotional parts still hit me like a train, and keep in mind I'm an 11 year old boy. What I enjoy the most about this movie are the visuals, graphics and effects. The way they animate certain elements in this movie such as water and fire are absolutely stunning. The story and arc is better than the first. The songs are on a different level than the first, yet it delivers just as well. This Frozen is somewhat darker than the first, although still maintaining the Disney spirit. I am not a huge Disney fan, because there are some other studios out there that make better movies IN MY OPINION. But this is on a whole new level than the first.
If you wanted to see this movie in theatres, I recommend you don't change your mind."
"Worst movie I have seen in a while,
Painful to sit through a floundering story that was all over the place.
Just horrible"
"Given the massive worldwide success that was ""Frozen"" (the first movie), the sequel had a whole lot to live up to. And, if it was able to even obtain half of that original movie's charm and excitement than I'm sure most audiences would leave their local theaters pleased and satisfied. All I can say is that the writers of ""Frozen 2"" really missed out on a golden opportunity. The story could have been so much better, and could have included many more elements of surprise, fun, and charm. Instead, the story (this time) was rather dry, predictable and even a little boring at times.Having said that though, I enjoyed most of ""Frozen 2"" as the (updated) visuals in their latest animation were absolutely amazing, and I still adored the original cast of characters as much as I did in the previous movie, as their personalities, dialogue, behavior was very much in the same manner as before. The music, while not as catchy and creative as the first movie, was good and was entertaining throughout. Also, the character Olaf was particularly funny and sometimes kept the movie from being too dry in certain scenes, although the writers did get a little carried away with a little too much Olaf.
All in all, ""Frozen 2"" was a decent movie, but it probably won't leave a long lasting impression on too many movie watchers out there and certainly won't make too many people want to buy the movie soundtrack or other (related) merchandise. In my honest opinion, this movie was okay at best, and could have been much better with a more effort put into the script and story-line"
"The storyline is a bit weak, and I felt a lot of thing is being forced into the movie and somehow it lost the magic. And I my opinion, Disney is trying very hard to hit another homerun... So much messages within this story... I felt like eating a dinner of sushi, curry, tomyum, pizza and all sort of big flavor... Trying too hard... Maybe make it simpler next time?"
Amazing just what can i say a pefect music and song.all pefect
"Seeing this in a theatre filled with families and kids was an almost magical experience. It is like seeing kids meeting Santa for the first time. Consequently I have no doubt this sequel will make all the billions and be just as, if not more loved than the first.This movie does a few things better than the first movie. I think the story is more, which is not necessarily better for the kids since it need a bit more thinking and understanding, but as an adult this sequel has a lot more to offer. I also think this is funnier, and oh God it is beautiful to watch. The cinematic experience of seeing this beauty on screen is magical... and yes, magical is the word of the day.
Elsa also goes fully magical and has several really cool superpower moments.
And did I mention how beautiful this movie is to watch?I also felt all the emotions. Expect to cry a lot, feel happy a lot, feel joy a lot, laugh a lot - it is a roller coaster ride and the third act is absolutely fantastic.The music is far superior to the first one, however there is no catchy ""let it go"". There are however at least 3 songs that are much better with the absolute masterpiece of ""The Next Right Thing"" sung with such heartache that I almost thought I had a stroke in the theatre.I think I can only mention one ""bad"" thing about this movie, and that is that it is not perfect. It drags a little bit from the end of the first act into the second act, and I think a few situations and events could have gone different. But those are very minor complaints. This is as good as a animated movie can be, and I walked out of the cinema feeling very happy.I extremely recommend and I give it a 10/10 which it deserve as an animated movie. Perhaps a 9/10 as a movie in general, but this is one of the best, perhaps the best, animated movie of all time.Edit: Saw it again, this time in a big company. Seeing it a second time I think I enjoyed it even more. This is a great, amazing movie.
But more than that; we sat behind a bunch of 10-11yo girls living the movie so vividly to such a degree that I swear one of them passed out when a certain water ""fight"" take place. They were in complete and utter awwwww throughout the movie, and I cannot think of a better score than that. This movie is absolutely brilliant. Give it all the Oscars."
"This ""Movie"" has stunning visuals and NOTHING else! The ""Story"" is boring and more like a torture. The songs are like a torture, too! Boring, unmemorable, no real melodies, only this annoying ""Daa Da Daa Daaaa"", which is some kind of brainwashing... really bad! The trailers promissed so much and the movie delivered nothing... Again: Great looking visuals can't save a movie. It's so poor what was shown after six(!) years. The short-movies were way better than ""Frozen II""! I suggest to take the ""Frozen""-Bluray or DVD and watch it again. Then you will have a good time! By the way: My rating of 3/10 is for the visuals ONLY!"
"I am absolutely sick of these frozen movies, they are very overrated"
"There's really nothing for me to add on that others hadn't already said. This film was made for cash and merchandise so I didn't expect much. But you would think 6 years is a long time to think of even a bit of a story, but there's nothing there, besides exposition and fluff to distract you from this mediocre movie."
"I really applaud the big risk the film makers took to shift away from the classic good guy - bad guy storyline and instead go for a more daring journey of self discovery. The film looks amazing visually and I really liked the world building in this film. However, the execution of the film is muddled and the plot is contrived, unnatural and it does not flow as smoothly as the first entry.This film feels thematically darker than the first one, but I was rather disappointed with the ending that feels forced and unnatural so as to appeal to the younger kids. The humor was quite good but the musical numbers could not match up to the already classic original film.Overall, an interesting addition to the franchise that really lacked the magic touch that captivated audiences in the first film."
"Like it's definitely for children, but I had a great experience as a 45 years old going alone. Glad I didn't bring my girlfriend though because we were all queer baited a little bit."
So many miserable critics! This movie had it all and crushed the first movie. Highly recommended. It's a real tear jerker! Go see it!
It's amazing animation.all family watched this animation very excited and enjoyed.I recommend that all families watch this movies.👏👏👏
"I waited so eagerly for this movie ever since the first teaser trailer came out. I watched all the trailers and played all the song snippets like every day because I couldn't wait for this movie to come out. The trailers promised me so much more than what I have just watched today. The trailers made it look like it was going to be a whole lot better than the first movie. I was let down. No, Frozen II did not surpass the original, contrary to what some other reviewers might want you to believe. The original movie was far more superior than the sequel in so many ways.Frozen II reminded me of Ralph Breaks The Internet. It tried too hard to surpass its predecessor and came up short. The story was all over the place, too many things that led to nothing, stories didn't connect very well together, plot holes left and right, the solution too simplistic and predictable, nothing original or groundbreaking here unlike the first movie.Having said that, it's still worth watching for Frozen fans. All the songs were good, I would say melodically they were better than the songs from the first movie. Elsa was prettier than ever, I felt like the visuals were better in general too. Olaf was still funny (or annoying, depending on how you see it). But Elsa without braid? That's one thing I'd like to complain about Elsa. Elsa without braid is like the world without air. I can't believe they took away her pretty braid and made her look like Rapunzel! Not cool, Disney.I know I might be a little too harsh rating this 5/10 but that's how I felt about the weak story line and that ending. But this won't deter me from going to see Frozen III if they ever decide to make one. Yes, take my money, Disney, as long as you give Elsa her braid back."
"Frozen 2Overall this was really quite uninspiring which is a dreadful shame as I was looking forward to this so much.What was just poorly doneThe story was a hash, in the first movie there was no reason why knowledge of Elsa's magical powers was kept as a secret from her sister and here, again, we had a plot that relied on withholding secrets without any reason.Instead of a strong simple linear story we had vague labyrinthine waffle that focused on feelings, fears and anxieties.We had whole sections that were a memory of the first movie, this was worthless padding and unnecessary for a knowing audience.Again men were represented as bumbling, evil or violent and women the champions of the truth and light. Sexism is repugnant on all levels and morally reprehensible when served up as brainwashing for children.The songs were instantly forgettable, trite and derivative, with one exception, perhaps the highlight of the movie, Stephan's boy band song with the reindeer, it was inspired.In conclusion the whole thing was so over-feminised, Elsa went to bed with full face makeup, multiple hair-do's throughout, more clothes changes than a Vogue fashion shoot, and a touchy-feely plot dominated by two powerful women. Perhaps a perfect combination for an 8 year old girl but alienating for everyone else."
"It was just TONS of references to the first movie. It was ridiculous how many times they referenced something from the original movie. They literally explained the ENTIRE plot of the first movie once in the middle of the movie and partially in the after credits scene!! I get why they did it, and they did it for laughs, but dear God, it was excruciating.Every single character regressed from where we left them at the end of the first movie. From a story structure perspective they did the exact same story over again.The Lopez's did the best they could writing music for a truly mediocre story, but most of the songs felt like they phoned them in. ""Into the Unknown"" is musically an amazing song, and a phenomenal performance by Idina, but it will not have the sticking power of ""Let It Go."" It didn't evoke an emotional response because it didn't make any sense in the story. Tons of lines in the song make you think some things are going to happen, and then they never happen. It was very confusing.I was so excited to hear that Jonathan Groff would be singing something other than ""Reindeer's are Better than People"" (Which he sang again anyway because we have to reference the first movie ONCE MORE!) but his song ""Lost in the Wood"" was so bizarre and out of left-field story-wise it felt weird and uncomfortable.Josh Gad's performance was delightful, especially considering they wrote Olaf as an immature, irritating, annoyance in this movie. But, his song, which is so unrememberable it's not even worth looking up the title of, was a snorefest.The whole movie felt like they got a group of 11-year-old kids together and asked them what their favorite parts of ""Frozen"" were and then said, ""As long as we include all of those things, we'll have a hit!"""
"A sequel for a masterpiece like FROZEN was never going to be easy. I originally watched that film 20+ times and recently rewatched it in preparation for the sequel and I'm still floored by it - such an enjoyable, beautifully produced film with a story that had it all - drama, complexity, comedy plus of course the music. IMDB had message boards available at the time where people could discuss films and it was incredible to see how much depth and symbolism and themes people saw in an animated movie primarily intended for children. FROZEN 2 does not replicate that. If you enjoyed the first movie, it's worth watching the sequel BUT I would caution people to NOT expect that ""wow"" factor so many of us got from the first. There are nice visuals but overall it comes across to me as something that should have been released maybe as Christmas TV special and not a follow-up to the highest grossing animated film of all time. Also, first film had one of the great soundtracks in movie history with LET IT GO and so many other great songs. Not one memorable song in F2. Terrible music and really too much music. The standout character for me was actually Olaf and probably the highlight of the movie was a recap he provides of the events in the first movie - VERY VERY funny. All in all I would say not really a disappointment BUT only if you go in just happy to be able to see the characters again in a follow-up story. Do NOT expect the caliber of film we got in FROZEN."
"Greetings again from the darkness. Let it go. Forget the sisterly issues of the Oscar winning original from 6 years ago. Arendelle is now doing just fine under ""Ice"" Queen Elsa and Princess Anna. Well, at least until Elsa is beckoned to the foggy, off-limits Enchanted Forest by an ethereal voice that only she can hear. We know this probably isn't good since the movie kicks off with a flashback to when the sisters were very young and their parents (voiced by Alfred Molina and Evan Rachel Wood) told them a historically significant story of the forest - a story with a vital missing piece.Joining Elsa (voiced again by the wonderful Idina Menzel) and Anna (Kristen Bell) on this journey to the forest and a discovery of the past are more familiar faces from the first movie: woodsman Kristoff (Jonathan Groff, who also plays Holden Ford in the excellent TV series ""Mindhunter""), Kristoff's loyal reindeer Sven, and everybody's favorite huggable, philosophizing snowman, Olaf (Josh Gad back for an expanded role that provides more laughs).Co-directors and co-writers Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee return for the sequel and their script, co-written with Marc Smith, features the familiarity that we'd expect from such a successful original, but it adds pieces that will likely be too confusing for younger viewers. Trying to recapture the magic of their Oscar winning song ""Let it Go"", songwriters Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez seem to have a singing interlude approximately every 8 minutes or so. Olaf gets a cute song, and this time, even Kristoff has his musical moment with ""Lost in the Woods"" (Jonathan Groff is a Broadway veteran). Of course, it's Elsa/Idina Menzel who provides two impressive power vocals. It appears ""Into the Unknown"" is getting the PR push, but personally I preferred ""Show Yourself"".Don't think it's all about the songs. There is an odd storyline that seems a bit preachy about making amends to past sins (politically and personally), and just how devastating it can be to discover that one's family tree has some rotten branches. Whether kids ""get"" that nature's balance must be restored, they will surely appreciate the two sisters: Anna's inner-strength and determination matching Elsa's magical powers. And all ages will enjoy Olaf's comical fast-talking recap of the first movie - a scene itself worthy of admission.While the songs might fall short this time around, and the story might be a bit more convoluted, there is no arguing that this sequel looks fantastic. The enhanced animation is quite stunning at times. As opposed to the blue and white color scheme of the first movie, this sequel features a palette that draws from Martha Stewart's Thanksgiving table setting - the autumn colors are vibrant and gorgeous.FROZEN II will have a bit more Oscar competition in the animated category than what its predecessor faced, as it will be going up against instant classic TOY STORY 4. The filmmakers are to be commended for bringing attention to natural elements of air, water, fire, and earth; however, a couple of the extended sequences will likely prove too intense for younger viewers. ""Do the next right thing"" may be the new Disney Golden Rule, but it's difficult to imagine a non-talking gecko or terrifying Earth Giants will emerge as a new favorite toy. Parents should know going in that by the end, Elsa sports a new dress and hairdo, conflicting with an early song ""Some Things Never Change"". And when parents realize a third ""Frozen"" movie is in the works, they should know that warm hugs help. Let's just hope the next one isn't called ""Ice Cubed""."
I cried about 3 times. Lol Such a great movie. The audience even stood up to clap when it ended. This movie was a nice surprise. Going to go see it again.
"Frozen 2 is the sequel to the 2013 Oscar winning Animated film of the same name and this time Anna and her sister Elsa(Kirsten Bell and Idina Menzel) along with Kristoff (Johnathan Groff)and the two sidekicks Olaf (Josh Gad)and Sven travel through an enchanted forest as Elsa hears a voice and she wants to set out and find out what it is and to discover the truth of her supernatural powers. But will she find out about her parents and the four spirits.Overall both my mom,my brother and myself all found it very good. My mother even thought that it was alot better than the original.Josh Gad is more funnier in this one than he is in the original one and as for Johnathan Groff as Kristoff he was still great as this time he tries to pop the question to Anna yet it backfires on him multiple times. Also the songs are really good. I loved the song Into The Unknown which was very good. There's finally a song that Kristoff sings and it's more of a 90s pop ballad.This film will have you laughing,in awe and you maybe crying too. Although I'm not a fan of Frozen as I'm more of a Tangled fan but I do love Frozen and Frozen 2. Will there be another one god only knows but I have a funny feeling we will be getting a prequel of Frozen in 2030."
"The teaser was intriguing enough to get me interested, but there is much to be improved in this instalment. First, there are too many songs. The songs use up half the run time and none are as memorable as Let It Go, nor as fun. Second, some characters are just annoying and inconsequential to the plot. Third, the payoff does not deliver. The story starts off with a mystery and the revelation does not feel worth the build up. However, if you can enjoy these, the good elements include the visuals, and the few action scenes. Needless to say, Elsa is faced with the biggest challenge ever and we fear for her. But in the end, this is what we expect from a Disney movie: songs, and adventure. If only they focused more on the story, because the plot direction made the story a genuinely new adventure."
"Though Elsa-Anna-Olaf-Kristoff-Sven are fictional character they are deep rooted in everyone who saw Frozen I. Love is unconditional. This part was so quick and had a rush up of the past. The most beautifully animated films, filled with extraordinary visual to detail. Love to watch it again. : )"
"This movie was so moving and magical. In my opinion, better than the first movie. I cried far more times than I had planned on and I don't normally cry seeing a movie for the first time unless it really touches me. The animation and art was beautiful and the story itself, once everything came full circle and you understood what was happening, just breaks your heart and the emotion they put into the characters were amazing. My favorite part I can't get over is Show Yourself. This sequence is the main reason I give it a 10/10. This emotionally driven scene is so touching and beautiful unlike one I've seen before in a Disney movie. Go watch it for yourself and enjoy."
Some people like adventures and fights. This movie has its own type of things that are happening. The music and the animation were great and I liked the characters a lot. And it was a bit funny!
"Omg worse then Beauty and the BEAST !
I wanted to Love both Movies But 2 songs should be the MAX ! LOVED between singing parts of movies but very rare I swear about 10 songs ur Killing me ."
First off animation was amazing! Really enjoy the back story of Anna and Elsa. Since we didn't get that much information about them in the first movie. The films pacing was kind of off. There were some scenes I felt like it didn't need to be there. There were great moments but there wasn't another a song that really stood out to me. But it's a great film but they could of execute it better.
"I wanted to like this movie. I really enjoy the first one! It may not be my favourite and does have its flaws but I definitely felt the Disney magic in it. And that's the major problem with Frozen II. Even though it was entertaining (seriously I laughed way too many times) it felt rushed, and the magic didn't seem to make the cut.I disliked it from a writing standpoint. It felt like it ran out of time to find a coherent plot and tried to make the characters and songs carry it. It bothered me that there wasn't an impactful villain or consequences for anyone's actions.I liked most of the songs (Show Yourself and the Next Right Thing accompanied great character development!) but some of them felt non-important to the story and disposable, namely When I'm Older and Lost in the Woods, even though they were really entertaining to watch.Moving on to characters I was surprised to find that I liked Olaf in this much more!! I think his comic relief was very effective now that he's more ''mature''.
And the worst has to be Kristoff...His whole arch about proposing to Anna was rather lazy, he seriously deserved better.In the end, the animation saved the movie because it was beautiful nonetheless! I was astonished at the water physics and how Elsa' s powers were portrayed, and the color and new designs were all so aesthetically pleasing! My favourite had to be the compositions showing contrast between blue and orange, cold and warm.If nothing, Frozen II made me appreciate the original much more."
"My immediate takeaway is that this film explored the mystery surrounding Elsa's powers with ingenuity and maturity.
Where the first film felt superfluous due to a lot of rapidly changing elements (Elsa isolating herself then random trolls then Hans suddenly shifting moral compasses), the second stays on tract. What I mean by this is that the first film was all over the place plot wise, but this film picks a theme and sticks with it. This more linear plot I like better as it explores the mystery surrounding Elsa.
Spoilers below...
Olaf clearly serves a comic relief purpose as he makes light of dark situations. His death was touching but you knew he was coming back at the end.
I like the Inception style exploration of Elsa's past and the backstory is a great answer to many questions. Some wonder how she is the 5th spirit but clearly the story makes it clear she was chosen by the spirit to bring balance between Arendell and the Northrunda people, and serves in that role. Elsa is a bridge between the 4 spirits and the world.
Anna becoming queen was a great choice because I think she suited the role.
Overall great story, great humor (kristoff's song) and great film."
"The original story has developed in a heartwarming sequel, very emotional for the Frozen fan's.
All characters are the same, even funnier and have more personality .
There are no negative ""bad"" heroes. The fight against of unlucky circumstances.
With deep philosophy points this film will be interesting for the whole family."
"No kidding, I thought the first one is feminist cirngey at best, but thanks to this movie, I can finally understand Elsa a bit in the first movie. Yes, this sequel is the story of Elsa where she is actually the real hero, or heroin (Where in the first movie, IMHO, the real hero of the story is Anna and that ""Let it Go"" moment doesn't change that fact in my mind). Here, she's matured, (Almost) no longer being ""Queen Sad"", selfless, brave, and adventurous, which I thought she got from her cheerful lil' sister. Like Elsa herself here, the sequel itself, as a whole movie, has similar characteristics. The creators were bold enough to switch the color of the story from girlish to the more adventurous one without making either of the female lead to be masculine in most times they are on screens. Love how they delivered the references to the first movie, especially how Elsa herself was a little bit embarrassed about her most iconic moment in the entire franchise, representing the PoV of much, much male viewers ha ha ha...... Love how they also portrayed male supporting characters without undermining or ridiculing their part of the story. The animation, the visualization even though probably not the best of 2019, still powerful enough to entertain and captivate general viewers that it's worth my attention. So far so good as we get closer and closer to the end of year, let's see what the remaining of 2019 still has to offer before getting to the new hype train of 2020."
"I was nervous for this movie as I (a 41 year old now) loved the first one and I didn't really care for the shorts that they did over the years. I read a movie critic review before I went and it didn't leave me hopeful, but I was pleasantly surprised. It is deeper/darker (but not dark-dark)/more mature than the first and it is certainly not better than the first one but it is good. I was entertained which is ultimately what I hope for when I go to a movie. I like Elsa's main song and the colors are beautiful. I was a little confused at time and my 8 year old daughter was kind of ""meh"" afterwards. She was really confused on some parts but we talked it over after."
"Just saw a screening of this for free as a friend of mine had won a couple of tickets to go see it.
I'm quite a fan of modern day animated movies, I like Wreck it Ralph, Toy Story and Monsters Inc etc but i wasn't the greatest fan of the original Frozen movie. Sure it had its moments but it wasn't one of the best ones out there. Just ok.Having just come back from seeing this one, it's more of the same but seems to have less charm and there's almost zero for adults to enjoy.
At least with movies like the ones i just mentioned, they're loads of fun for kids but also have a lot of adult humour in there to keep the parents entertained. There's very little in this one that you can say that about, it's so safe and tame that anyone over 6 or 7 years old will quickly get bored.Frozen 2 seems like a cash grab to me, the story is less fun, it feels like it written in a few days, the jokes are, for the most part, terrible and the songs are just awful, headache inducing.
Don't get me wrong, the main song in the first one has become famous for making parents worldwide, tear thier hair out everytime they hear it. But when it first came out, it was a charming song to listen to every now and then (not, however, on repeat for hours and hours like most parents had to endure).
In Frozen 2, none of the songs are remotely fun enough for kids to want to play them over and over, so i think parents may be spared the same fate this year.Overall, I found this film to be quite dull and I was glad when it finished, the snowman, Olav or Olaf or something, has a few funny lines but they're only that, a few, it's colourful, noisy and I am sure younger children will absolutely love it, but for the poor adults taking them and even for slightly older kids, there's very little here of interest.Save your money for something else to entertain your young ones for the day, it will be money better spent."
LOVED IT! I LOVED THE SONGS THEY WERE ALL AMAZINGGGGG
"I think that sequels especially this one have a lot to overcome, especially when the movie is beloved. Many of the reviews seem like they were written by people who are intent on hating the movie. My husband and I have 3 kids; an 11 yo girl; 8 yo boy and 2 yo girl. We all went and liked it. I thought it started slow with unmemorable songs and mostly content from the trailer. From the moment Elsa sings Into the Unknown and beyond it really picked up and was a solid movie. It pulled at heart strings and had funny moments and some good songs. On all accounts it delivered and the box office is proving that. I worried that it would be really boring and pointless like Frozen Fever but it managed to pull in relevant pieces of Frozen 1 to make a pretty solid film. Worth seeing. Don't expect to know the songs coming out of the theater immediately. But they are decent and will grow on you."
Absolutely beautifully done! Every scene is so beautiful. The storyline is interesting. The music is great. Didn't disappoint at all.
"Frozen 2 for me its not even close to be good as original only thing that is better is more intersting plot and story but everything else fails starting with not so iconic songs and a lot of characters that dont have big reason to be in film and becase of that character of kristofer suffer becase of it, and dissapears in middle of film and appears only in the end which is simple said lazy writing"
"While the first movie felt more for my little sister and a little bit for me, this film was a type for both of us! For my little sister, they would have the usual Disney Princess elements, the fun characters, and songs. But for me, a 14 year old, this film would have plot twists, good humor, and another person to be affected by Thano's snap! Because one of the characters flakes, or should I say, blipped. Turns out, Disney really made a good sequel this time!"
"Frozen I shows that ""true love"" melts the ice. Frozen Fever shows how the Snowgies is made. And now, when Frozen II came out, this film predicts the future via storytelling with Olaf in the post-credits scene. Anyway, the predictable events is all occuring before the ""very end"". In the Frozen franchise timeline, Olaf's presentation takes place shortly before the 2017 featurette ""Olaf's Frozen Adventure"" in order to make sense by clearing out memories of this film for the holiday season.9 Blocks of Ice Chopped out of 10."
"The ending was unexpected, it was a great story with a really good visual and editing"
"Visuals are spectacular, as is to he expected from Disney, the story is darker, as sequels should be, but it isn't a grandiose masterpiece. If the trailers sold you on the idea, see it. If you don't mich care for the first one, don't see it. This won't add too many fans, but it is entertaining."
"This movie exists.It doesn't need to. Frozen, while not a huge home run to me is still a solid and complete movie about love and, more importantly, redefining the concept of love as it pertains to the Disney Princess, which is hugely valuable.Frozen II is... Pretty. Obviously, that's not nothing, it is beautifully animated and wonderful to look at. The voice acting is still spot on and the music is still fun. There doesn't seem to be a huge ""Let It Go"" magnitude hit here, but instead they corrected a huge problem in the first one and finally let the fantastically gifted Idina Menzel really show off in multiple songs. Seriously, it's a musical and that woman can sing, so glad they gave her more to do. Which is t to say the others are bad, on the contrary, but they don't measure up to her. Beyond the singing though, Elsa and Anna are great, they're so much fun, they have such wonderful experiences and emotional adventures. Kristen Bell brings a lot to Anna and continues to make what could have been a mediocre character something fun.And that's about where the pro's stop and the con's begin. Perhaps the biggest problem I have with this movie is how poorly defined everything is. I have no idea what Elsa's powers are or what she can do, I don't know what other types of magic can really do, I don't know where anything is in relation to anything else and anytime the movie runs into these problems it feels like the answer is just ""Magic!"" which doesn't work for me. It feels I don't know the rules anymore, and probably worse, I don't think the movie knows.I mean, it's a kids movie so maybe it doesn't care that much. BUT I DO!There's also a, and I don't know if I'm just being crazy or what, but it felt like there was a very serious message about keeping people separated rather than bringing them together. Especially in regards to one group of people basically being relegated to an isolated reservation of land while the very white invaders return to their palace. A group that had been promised coexistence once before the invaders attempted to wipe them out. I don't know that the movie is trying to say something here but I noticed it and it made me feel icky.Also, what happened to Kristoff? He's supposed to be a somewhat important character in these things and he's just shoved to the side about a third of the way through, has a really awkward and meta song that completely pulled me out of the movie and then he's just gone until the very end with no explanation as to what he's doing. Then there's Olaf who has some good moments but is also pretty annoying at times.Still, despite all of that, despite feeling like those negatives should make me dislike this movie, it's still fun, the music is still great and it's probably worth checking out if you enjoyed the first one. Just kind've hope they stop making these now."
"To start, I must say I am a life-long Disnerd who proclaimed Elsa my spirit animal after ""Frozen"" came out. That being said, because the story line, music, character depth & arcs, etc. were so strong, I had high expectations for F2. After seeing it last night, my reaction? ""M'eh"".For me, there were a lot of missed opportunities in this story. There was no ""villain"" to set us gasping in shock and collectively rooting for their defeat. The music was pleasant, but there was no tune that left me hunting it up on the internet to hear it again afterwards. Indeed, it felt like they just dumped a hodge podge of songs into the movie with no real benefit to the story. After a while, Elsa's echo with the ""voice"" of the music-intervaled cry kind of got annoying.The overall tone of this move is dark, which I don't necessarily have a problem with, as long as the story line makes sense. However, the supposed ""twists"" were easily anticipated, while others made zero contribution to the plot - why throw in the shipwreck? We want to see a character grow, and all that served was another vehicle for guilty Elsa. Elsa & Anna's arc left me more confused than anything by the end of the movie.That being said - nobody does animation like Disney! The sheer artistry of the scenes were incredible. The horse's mane absolutely blew me away, as did all the scenes with the fire spirit and the sea. The color scheme was rich and draws you in. The texture and fine detail produced was simply exceptional.The one-liners and sidebar characters saved this movie for me - Olaf's ""When I am Older"" and some of his cracks were great! The little fire spirit was so darn cute, I want one to go with my Disney paraphernalia! Kristoff's 80's/90's boy band-esque ""Lost in the Woods"" had all the adults in the audience chuckling.My litmus test for any movie is always ""would I buy this?"". It's a little sad to me that for the first time in several movies, this Disney tale is NOT going on my Google Play wish list. But, my baby brother and my 13 yo niece loved it, which is all that was important to me last night."
"Because This Movie Was Epic, The Grafik Is So Kawaii Be Like Miraculous, But, What A Funny Scream From Olaf, Thank You"
"Maybe because I seldom watch movie, or I almost never expect any movies too high, I enjoyed this movie very much.
Disney successfully produced this movie until I should get up from my seat unwillingly because the movie was over.
Animation quality? Disney never makes us disappointed.
Story of the movie? Easy for children to understand, but worthy enough for mature to watch.
Emotion? My friend sobbed beside me. Trust me you'll not find any moment that emotion of relation of sisters is blown up too soon.
Soundtrack? Please don't listen to it before you watch the movie, because all of them were well composed and fit the movie.
Or maybe you guys were disappointed about ""fall to far away"" moment. However, that moment is the climax (a) and suddenly become the climax (b) that changes the movie into epic ending.
Thank God I always find the way of how I enjoy the movie. I hope you guys find yours too."
"I went into Frozen II with mid-level expectations and found myself really enjoying the fun, beauty, and magic much more than I anticipated. Both adults and kids alike will be able to find things they can relate to in this movie that is often lighthearted, but touches on many heavy topics.The biggest downside I found was the weak writing (or editing) near the end of the film. A lot builds up to it, but then it seems to come to an end too simply and without much in-content explanation. I do not know if they cut scenes out for time or if the writers couldn't come up with a way to make the moments have a stronger impact. Granted, the simplification might be better for young children.Either way, I wouldn't say that made the movie any less great, I just believe it could have even been better. I expect movie goers to come away with awe and wonder, giggles, maybe a tune or two stuck in their head, and likely a few questions regarding the climax. Which for the most part can easily be explained through assumption."
Is that just me? Too many Avatar things in this movie.
"I didn't even like the first Frozen. But I thoroughly enjoyed this movie!! Everyone is complaining about the storyline being simple and predictable, but it's a children's movie. Duh. It was visually stunning, the music was STELLAR, and was honestly hilarious at some parts as well. Definitely worth the watch!!"
"Similarly to the first movie, the plot revolves around Elsa and Anna aka teh best sister duo in cinema. It reinforces the idea of love being above fear.
The most beautiful part of his movie are the visuals for sure!!! There are some really beautiful scenes, full of emotion and colour. The soundtrack is just as phenomenal and brings even more power and strength to many scenes. The plot is also more sophisticated than its prequel. The songs are also filled with simbolism, left to your interpretation.
Overall the movie is just as good as the first one, even though it has some darker moments. Definitely worth watching!"

Frozen II casts a magic spell that was incredible in regards to animation, utilizing the elements well, and really bringing the elements of the first movie back for fun and trying to evolve on them. It moves well, has humor that lightens up the mood, and yet very touching at others with its inspirational moments. The movie certainly feels like a slightly beefed up version of the first in terms of gimmicks of presentation of non-story elements, which in this day and age is often more important. Yet, the story feels very deprived of the richness the book promised, not utilizing its characters well, getting a bit preachy at the end, and for me forcing songs in again rather than finding that balance. When looking at this for recommendations... it works for a theater visit for many reasons and I really think fans of the first one will be spelled by the things its brings. However, the sequel needs some tinkering for me to be the next best Disney film, and hope it's not as overrated as the first one.My scores are:Animation/Adventure/Comedy: 7.5
Movie Overall: 6.5-7.0"
"This movie was very awesome that the first one. I like every at the beginning in the middle an at the end. I feel like the story should continue. Now Elsa is free so what new things is going to happen to her and new experience and what about Anna I didn't see any wedding. I have message for you all, go watch the movie in theaters and put positive ratings and like this movie. And make this movie the best animated ever. One last question who wants to see frozen 3. If you want to have frozen 3, you know what to do. Liked this movie and tell friends and family go to watch the movie. I need your help that this movie be the best just the first one.!!please!!"
"Soundtrack was outstanding. The songs were well timed and progressed the story nicely. The best part for me was the message - ""Do The Next Right Thing"". The one thing that would have taken the rating to 10 - the stages in the quest were not challenging/thrilling enough"
Loved the movie!! I laughed and cried and i loved the animation of the movie!! Can't wait to see it again!! There was one part i didn't like but i still loved it and would tell anyone to go see it!!
"These low scores are pure cacauphony. Don't be bitter because Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee are better storytellers than all of us put together. They've crafted a phenomenal sequel whose maturity and tone progress the first film in every way. They had ALOT to live up to and they did so while not giving in to what society or even the Disney stigma might have warranted. I, for one, am glad they did not give in to the ""Elsa-girlfriend"" theories we kept reading about for months, not because they chickened out, and not because it would not have made for a compelling story line, and NOT because I wouldn't have gone to see the movie if they did, but rather to further Elsa's character in a different way. The decision was purely for the story THEY wanted to tell and that should be applauded. Of course, the whole film should be applauded from beginning to end. People are complaining that there ""might"" not be a bad guy, um... rarely in life is there one person that is our antagonist, isn't it enough that life, our relationships, the ""unknowns"" we all face, be difficult and challenging in and of themselves? There IS an antagonist in this film you just have to be mature enough to see it. I have 3 daughters all under 5 who have loved the first film for their entire lives since it came out in theaters before they were all born. And they loved this film too. And they should. I would see it again right now. The story is phenomenal and NOT predictable and the songs are greater as a whole than the first films (barring Let It Go of course, that was lightning in a bottle). I feel like the best advice any of us can take to films nowadays is to let ourselves be vulnerable to the emotions being portrayed on screen. If you don't then no film will ever live up to what you wanted it to be. Sit and fume then, nay sayers, while I enjoy this beautiful film again."
"I'm not sure why some people say it sucked. I went with my nephew and I thought the story was good and kept me intrigued throughout and had so many emotions, great visuals and was as good if not better than the first. I would def. Recommend this movie if you liked the 1st one! The characters from Frozen are awesome!"
"Frozen II is a film with amazing visuals, the autumn season and the forest are really beautiful. But the songs every 5 minutes are annoying, but Kristoff solo song ""Lost in the woods"" Is beautiful and strong, it deserves an Oscar. The script is simple, looking for a mistery around about Elsa's Power and her patentes. A decent film but it could be a better film, perfect for the children."
"The storyline was kinda slow and boring on the beginning, with almost no conflict on the middle and being rush at the end."
"Although it gets a lot of hate on the internet, a large part of it being because of its popularity, to me the first 'Frozen' (apart from the rushed end and one out of place song, ""Fizer Upper"") is a great film and one of Disney's best in recent years. It is so beautifully animated, has two great lead characters with a heartfelt bond between them and the songs are wonderful, especially ""For the First Time in Forever"", ""Do You Want to Build a Snowman"" and ""Let It Go"".So hopes were very high for this long-awaited sequel, which looked great from the advertising and the good word of mouth further sparked interest. Am somebody that never shows any bias or intended at least bias towards sequels, despite their reputations. Watching 'Frozen 2', it is one of not many sequels in existence to be very nearly as good as its predecessor. Not quite as good, to me the first is a little bit better, but compares favourably in comparison to a lot of films released in the latter part of this year.'Frozen 2' isn't perfect. The ending for my tastes was a little rushed and anti-climactic.To me as well, it did take time to warm up. It was with ""Into the Unknown"" when the film got going, some might even say broke the ice.However, the animation is fantastic. For me, the best-looking of the animated films released this year. Not just the meticulous attention to background and character detail and rich colours, but in particular those jaw-droppingly gorgeous landscapes. The songs are not quite ""Let It Go"", but are still the very meaning of razzle dazzle in a good way. ""Into the Unknown"" and ""Show Yourself"", both of which leave a vast emotional impact, are the best, though ""Lost in the Woods"" is also pretty entertaining. Writing is pitched perfectly, the dramatic moments are genuinely touching like in the first 10 minutes and the humorous moments very sharply written and smart.Plus, Anna and Elsa are such great, relatable characters and their relationship once again provides a lot of heart. Have never had a problem with Olaf, Sven is adorable and Iduna is a compelling addition. The story is not perfect in the pace and it is simple, but on the most part it's very absorbing, it's just as fun and heartfelt as that for the first film. It also stands out for its darker tone and deeper themes that don't feel too much of a shift. All the original voice actors are back on board and all do fine jobs and display powerhouse vocals once more, especially Idina Menzel, who continues to bring so much heart and soul into Elsa, and Evan Rachel Wood likewise as Iduna.Concluding, very well done sequel to a great first film. 8/10"
"The story of this movie is weak, very weak. To me the plot is manufactured, not written.The climax was far too simple and unsatisfying.
I'm giving 5 starts because I love Elsa and Anna. The visuals are also good.
But the magic Disney created on 1st part, is totally missing in this one. Even Olaf's Frozen adventure was better than this"
"(+) Frozen II will give you a great visual. It is really something, sometimes it gives a dark tone. and changes into colourful tone. I love the new style of elsa. Hopefully someday Disney will give its live-action movie.(-) Uo uo uo is the only song that I remembered this whole movie. After I went out from the movie. That uo uo from siren stucked in my head. Next, what I believed from this movie is its lackness in the storyline. Seriously, you just go on the adventure without eating any foods? What do you eat guys let me know. Furthermore, when the dead scene of Olaf came out, I suddenly thought that he would live again wkwk. This is such as predictable scene. Then, This is what I really hate from the movie, its ENDING. No climax, you want to marry someone but ends into something usual, no emotional feelings. It was felt like my flat face.Overall this movie targeted children. It was fine, but it will be better if the storyline has been managed better.I give you 7 uo uo"
"Wonderful character development of the main 5 characters. I fell in love more with each one. Captivating new characters introduced. Excellent bridging from the first movie to a possible 3rd movie (see what I did there). The music was great. The first frozen can stand alone, but I am so glad they made this sequel. I didn't ever know what to expect, it was full of surprises and original material. We were all captivated the entire time. What more can you ask for?"
I hope this movie fails. It sucks and is trash compared to the first movie. Not to mention the CGI is awful.
Outdoes the last Frozen by a ton and was a great movie.
"Not many times is the sequel to a movie better than the first movie, but this one is! Frozen 2 was amazing, they give you so much back story and the plot it fantastic!"
"I really appreciate that Disney didn't just crank out Frozen 2 a year or two after the original. They took their time and made sure the sequel was worthy of the original's quality. Frozen 2 deepens the mythology of the series while also exploring Anna & Elsa's parentage even further than I expected. The songs are expectedly superb (except for a few unnecessary tracks in the middle act), the animation is glorious, and I was once again moved to teary eyes towards the ending. Perhaps it doesn't completely reach the heights of the first film (not many animated films do) but I can see myself going back and enjoying the sequel just as much as I did with the first in 2013. 'Into the Unknown' is an absolutely smash hit too. So there's that.9.0/10"
We loved it. The story was fun and it was magical. Better than the first
"Probably nothing will beat Let it go, but soundtrack is still amazing and Elsas song is also great. Interesting touching story and surprising turn. Only I don't like as much Elsa's new look"
Frozen 2 is a great sequel that explores mature themes but is brought down slightly by a few predictable narrative revelations. Kristen Bell and Idina Menzel both give incredible performances and Josh Gad is also really good. The animation is incredible and the film is visually stunning throughout. It's well paced and the music by Christophe Beck is fantastic.
"Personally, it was ok - as a parent you have to sit through it and it wasn't too bad at all. Kids movies today do take parents into account so it's far from torture and I even had a chuckle at a few scenes. i didn't think it was as good as the original but ultimately the opinion of a 40 year old man is totally irrelevant. My 5 year old daughter however described it as ""The bestest movie in the world ever!"" - I countered that she hadn't seen movies such as Citizen Kane, the Godfather, Casablanca, the Shawshank redemption etc. but before finishing my list of contenders my little girl pointed out that none of those movies had a talking snowman. You can't argue with that.
I'll probably have to take her to see it again and given how much she loved it I'll be more than happy to sit through it once more. I asked her how many stars to give it and after a careful ponder she judged it to be '60 hundred and 40 infinity' - but 10's as high as it goes."
"I really like Frozen, I used to think it was okay at best, but it is really good, with it's magical songs, really beautiful animation, original and well executed plot, loveable characters with great voice acting!, I can see why people dislike it and find it overrated, mainly because of ""Let It Go"", which makes no sense to me, do they hate the film or the songs?, do they hate it because of the film?...., I don't know but I really like it!, but now we finally have a sequel after five or six years since the first film was released, the trailers looked super promising, epic and hopefully it could bring something much bigger in terms of plot and characters along with some new great songs, oh and yeah merchandising will be even more successful then before, knowing that it's Disney and Frozen, so I was excited for Frozen 2!, so I saw it on the 23rd of November, it was released on Friday the 22nd, but I manage to see it on Saturday and....... it is also really great, not quite as grand or well done as the first film but still a great time, so let's talk about it.After the events of the first film, Elsa (Idina Menzel) hears a voice that is coming from the Forrest which is calling out to her, which is also putting her home town of Arendelle in great danger, so she has to go to where the voice is, she is also accompanied by her sister Anna (Kristen Bell), Olaf the snowman (Josh Gad), Kristoff (Jonathan Groff) and Sven the Reindeer, who go on this journey to find out where the voice is coming from and to also discover the origins of Elsa, that's the basics of the plot, however there is a bit more to it then there already is, there is a subplot and a few twist and turns here and there and... it's pretty well executed for the most part, it keeps the intensity, and the events of the film more suspenseful and interesting, supplied with lots of good comedic moments mainly from Olaf and Sven, I also like how Elsa is now the main protagonist who now has to take the entire film, we get to learn about her past and what happen with her parents, there is also a really emotional scene also which did make me cry and so much more, it's all presented with lots of great elements that works!.... for the most part, there is a subplot with Kristoff trying to propose to Anna and marry her, but... that never went anywhere, it does have a sweet and happy ending to it, but it has no point at all, only to fill up the rest of the running time, it also feels quite short, it goes by quite quickly, despite having a really satisfying ending, the climax felt very anti-climatic and it finishes quite quickly, despite the writing not feeling quite as strong as how the first film's writing turned out with a couple of flaws, but the comedy, the mystery, the suspense, the action and emotion still feel just as impactful as the first film was!.The animation is truly at it's best when it comes to the 3-D Disney animated films, this movie looks so gorgeous!, it's so breathtaking, it almost has a photorealistic look to it, the effects with Elsa's powers and inside of the forest look so magical, colourful and impressive with what they can do and what they look like, each character still has that signature Disney design to them, they all look identifiable with their inquiry and great designs, with the beautiful looks of Elsa and Anna, the cartoony look of Olaf and so-and-so, the new characters look very interesting especially Lieutenant Mattias and the Salamander, Arendelle and the Forrest look incredibly beautiful, there is so much detail in every little area, I love it!, the one detail I also am really loving is the freckles, we know Anna has a lot, but you can clearly that Elsa has a few and Kristoff, usually in animated films, human characters just have normal skin without my features, I know Pixar can also add some freckles in some of their films also and I believe DreamWorks, Blue Sky has also done this, but it is a legit great little detail that I love, Olaf is creative as usual, the song ""When I Get Older"", is when I think Olaf gets even more creative, every unpredictable movement coming from the snowman is just funny, clever and creative, in fact all the songs in this film have beautiful and imaginative visuals in each and every one of them, like ""Into the Unknown"", ""Show Yourself"" and so much more, the animators worked the hardest they can with this film, to make it beautiful, stylish, magical, creative and funny and they certainly did a great of making this animation more spectacular then ever before!.The characters we all know and love are back once again and it is really great to see them back once again, Elsa now has to take the role of the being the main protagonist and she is a fantastic one, we get to learn a little bit more about her, she's sweet, funny, endearing, gorgeous and is really one of the best characters of the film, same can be said about Anna, she is really caring, protective, helpful and funny, her chemistry and relationship with Elsa is really sweet, since they are both sisters, you can tell that their bond feels more believable then you can imagine, I enjoy their chemistry and screen time together, they are really lovely together!, I still enjoy Olaf even if people find him annoying, I don't mind him at all, he is quite lovely, hilarious and charming, he does steal the show a lot and always make me smile whenever he shows up on screen, Kristoff is good, a bit better then before, I never was a big fan of him, I like him fine, his point in this film is very little, he is trying to propose to Anna but every time he does, Anna just looks away or starts to question Kristoff's choice of words, his subplot maybe pointless, but he is a decent supporting character, Sven is just himself again, he's a great supporting comic relief along with Olaf and they are both very cute when they are both together, now as for the new characters, there really is not much to them, Lieutenant Destin Mattias (Sterling K. Brown) is probably the best new character since he knows Elsa & Anna's parents and he is a really likeable and interesting character, the cute little Salamander that Elsa finds is just simply adorable, as for Iduna (Evan Rachel Wood) Ryder (Jason Ritter), Yelana (Martha Plimpton) who could of been so much more interesting, really don't serve that much of a purpose, I mean yeah they do have something connected to Anna and Elsa, but they are really just there and don't do much, however the voice acting from everyone is really good!, of course the original does reprise their roles as their respected characters with the lovely and beautiful Idina Menzel as Elsa, the caring and energetic Kristen Bell as Anna, the silly and funny Josh Gad as Olaf, the charming and amazing Johnathan Groff as Kristoff, they still have a whimsy and charming line delivery with each and every one of them, as for everyone one else, they do have great performances also, Sterling K. Brown is great as Mattias, Jason Ritter is pretty good as Ryder, Evan Rachel Wood is good as Iduna and everyone else does a pretty good job delivering their performances, most of the characters we all know and love are back and are even better then ever, with only two new great characters while some old and new characters don't do enough to support the film in any way, although the voice acting does save these characters from being dull I suppose, but overall, a good mix of characters, some are, funny, entertaining and memorable, while others.... aren't.The songs are just as equally amazing as the first film's songs, I love ""Into the Unknown"", it's easily the best song in this film, it's got great lyrics, a lovely atmospheric feel to it, ""When I Get Older"", is a quirky and funny little song, ""Show Yourself"" is a powerful and engaging song, as for the rest of the songs, they are good, really memorable and fun to watch, but they don't quite stand out as ""Into the Unknown"" & ""When I'm Older"".I'll give Disney this, this may not be perfect or better then the first film, but it was better then most of the Disney that has came out this year (Except for Toy Story 4 that is..), Frozen 2 is a pretty enjoyable and great sequel, it may not be perfect or as magical as the first film but it still has a lot to offer, it has a great story, good humour, beautiful and amazing animation, two fantastic leads, along with some pretty good supporting characters, along with terrific voice acting and wonderful songs, however it does suffer from a pointless subplot, feeling like it goes by too quickly, there were a few characters who are pretty useless and don't do much, and despite the fact I like all the songs, most of them don't really stand out, however despite those flaws, I still think Frozen 2 is worthy sequel that is worth seeing!, if you love Frozen or Disney in general, then you'll enjoy this film, if you can't stand Frozen then you'll get annoyed by this film, you know it's been a bit of clumsy year for Disney, however this and Toy Story 4 still show that they can still do strong and unforgettable films, so I'm happy that this sequel turned out well, although I prefer Ralph Breaks the Internet, this is still a great sequel none the less.I'm going to give Frozen 2 a 9.5/10."
"The first Frozen movie had raised the stakes too high for the second movie to be able to follow. Still, for an animation movie, it was good. Olaf was the main reason behind the movie's funny moments. The songs were okay and some of them enjoyable. The animation was fantastic and the visuals stunning. The story was predictable and weak, but entertaining and had a happy ending. The romance was just draging. So, six out of ten."
"First of all, the movie was well articulate and beautifully designed. The details and hidden in scriptures were well noticeable and pleasing to the eye. However. the story and plot was a emotional rollercoaster that had many twists and turns. It was sad, happy, meaningful and it was all captured into one hour and forty three minutes. The characters went through many changes along the path to the resolution, this did in fact ruin the movie, but it helped it embrace to it's truest potential, without this, Disney would not have the core moral standards you see today. Besides the little kid kicking my chair the whole movie, I really enjoyed it and so will your kids."
"I just watched it, and i cannot stop thinking about it, such an emotional rollercoaster, it makes you both cry and laugh. Its truly magical!!!! Beyond words! I cannot believe some ppl didnt like it, its sooooo much better than the first movie!! Nd the one song «Show yourself», is epic in every way, made me really cry. When the movie ended, everyone got up and clapped, 300 ppl clapping...awsome, that should tell you...GO AND WATCH IT!!!!!"
"This movie tackles very deep life philosophies. The fun is definitely there, the story line is very beatiful and complex. It's that type of movie where children laugh and the adults fall on deep thinking, and maybe cry just like I did, and the person next to me did and many more. I hope that many people will understand the deep meanings of this movie."
"The story is good. The plot is correct because questions from the first movie, are answered in this one. The water animation is great and the music is the best. If something I expect from Disney are movies with good music and lot of nice songs. And this movie has nice songs. Very funny Olaf. We laughed a lot with him. Nice the Elsa's costumes. We enjoyed this film as much and first. Great Disney."
"Frozen II continues with the story of Anna(Kristen Bell), Elsa(Idina Menzel), Olaf(Josh Gad), Kristoff(Jonathan Groff) & Sven. When the kingdom of Arendelle is in danger, Anna, Elsa, Olaf, Kristoff & Sven, go on a quest to discover the origin of Elsa's powers, in order to save Arendelle.Frozen II is an excellent film. Directors Chris Buck & Jennifer Lee have given us a sequel, that has all the elements that made Frozen(2013), such a success. The animation is breathtaking. The 3D is great. The songs written by Kristen Anderson-Lopez & Robert Lopez are fantastic but, not as iconic as its predecessor's songs. Overall though, Frozen II doesn't match up to Frozen(2013). Its story is not strong enough to justify its existence. The voice cast is the highlight of the movie. They sing flawlessly. Kristen Bell is spectacular as Anna. Idina Menzel is outstanding as Elsa. Josh Gad is hysterical as Olaf. Jonathan Groff is brilliant as Kristoff. Sterling K. Brown, Evan Rachel Wood & Alfred Molina are awesome as Mattias, Iduna & Agnarr, respectively. Frozen II is worth a watch if you're a fan of Frozen(2013). Just keep your expectations low & you won't be disappointed."
"I don't see first part, just new year one special, but even this spacial was much better then this sequel where they just stand at one place and talk. Like 1 hour of film and no decent action or funny jokes at all! But we have more then one femine male character, so I think 40 years at future Disney will need to get another ""its not reflect actual culture norms"" disclaimer like on Dumbo."
Storyline bit random and under-explained. Pretty clear theme tho. Some self-aware and funny jokes in there. Olaf by FARRR the best part of the movie.
"It was a great way to add and end frozens story! So many songs and they are all so great! My boys loved the movie, olaf is so funny and has some funny facts for the kids to learn from lol."
"I didn't like the first Frozen movie. I thought it was fine overall, but I really didn't like it. This though? It's decent enough. The animation is stunning, its darker than the first, has decent songs, a passible story, etc. Basically everything you would expect from a decent film. Kids will love it and it is able to be enjoyed by adults alike, but I just don't think its anything special. Frozen is grossly overrated in my opinion, and this film only added to that."
"Disney unites people intergenerationally and interculturally. It is fabulous that Disney Studios can find a subject to bring together people trhoughout the World, despite age and cultural differences. Frozen, by itself, is a treasure in Disney's artistic heritage. Cartoons and productions from Disney (even during the years of Walt Disney's life) often incorporate the many layers of complex and non-childish topics (For example, See Victory Through Air Power (1943) and how this animated movie helped USA win the World War II). Animation language became the more affordable tool of communication. In comparison, literature and filmmaking have restrictions (specifically, language) in the delivery of complex topics to a wide audience. If previous works from Disney aggregate the medieval narrative about woman as an object (Sleeping Beauty, Snow White and etc.), then new animated pictures, for example, Frozen, create the female character as active subject, full of rationality and bravery.Frozen II gives us a fantastic experience of reaching into the past in order to clarify and understand the future. Everyone will find his / her own character relative to their emotions. There is an incredible message about doing the right things to bring Peace, Joy, and Hope into the world. If the First Frozen has heavy underlying topics of women empowerment and gay semiotics, than this Second Frozen emphasizes more of a historical and political background, with an accent on immigration policy (acceptance of otherness, cohabitation, sheltering, asylum). The broken union between the Kingdom and Forest explicitly refers to American history and how ""the pilgrims"" (new aliens) treated the Native Americans. Certain inquiring minds will be able to perceive articulated Biblical plots and Mythologies in Frozen II (Olaf's Resurrection, Tongues of Fire; Song ""Show yourself"" as a Christian hymn; Aisoyimstan as the Snow God among the Native Americans, Mara is Slavic Goddess of Winter).In Frozen II Disney Studios have made an enormous effort to appeal to various ethnic audience in order to achieve a huge commercial success. Some people will extract certain ideas and messages which even the authors could not have anticipated, other people will just enjoy the animated miracles and masterpiece of art. Although people are divided and separated by the past as in the real world, as well as in the World of Frozen movie, Frozen II shows how people can find the ideas of mutual benefit in living together. Just do right things."
"""Frozen II"" somehow became a very good sequel to the first animated film. It's so much fun, magical, and heartfelt sequel to the first film in every way of thinking it's almost like the first film, but this time, Anna, Elsa, Kristoff, Olaf and Sven leave Arendelle to travel to an ancient, autumn-bound forest of an enchanted land. Wow, and now they set out to find the origin of Elsa's powers in order to save their kingdom. Oh yeah, I would have to say, it's better than the first one."
Honestly I don't agree with the bad reviews the soundtrack was great and into the unknown is an amazing song. The story line was great and thoroughly enjoyed the visuals of the film and personally I think it's better than the original. loved everything about this film and it's a must see!
"I took my sister to see this film, myself looking forward to it too. I'm not a huge fan of the first movie, but i do like it.
I can safely say that Frozen 2 wowed me - it has a darker and more serious nature than the first film, and a compelling storyline. Additionally, the scenery and animation is absolutely phenomenal - a definitive step-up from Frozen. The songs were great, and although the movie did have some serious themes presented, it included several hilarious sequences which I believe are enjoyable for all ages. 10/10 would recommend!"
"I wasn't sure what to expect. The first film is so indelible marked into my mind because of my two daughters that I was broached for their disappointment and mine.But the film delivered in spades.I've seen a LOT of children's films over the last 6 years and I have to say that this is one of, if not THE best of them all.It tackled female empowerment in a way that feels natural and non-patronising, it deepens and broadens the legend of the first film without diminishing that film, it moves the narrative onto a whole other level psychologically.So, from going in as a sceptic I came out as a convert.Let this sink in for a few years, I think it will be seen as a masterpiece in years to come."
"I enjoyed watching Frozen 2. I dad a really good time. No, it's not as good as the first part but it's a very good movie. There were very good comedy scenes, some thrilling moments and almost everything that was in Frozen. My fellow theatre viewers also enjoyed it as there were big laughs and some ooooh moments. The animation is really really good. Overall, Frozen 2 is a fun adventure and I think no one will dislike it as these characters are hard to hate."
"There're two sentences that Kristoff said and I still thought about it until now, is this a romantic movie? Lol I love it very much! Love how they added this kind of special touch in the movie. Must watch!"
"As an adult I enjoyed it more than the first one, I like the story and the animation is really good. It's definetly darker than the first one, and my 3 year old had some hard time with the, but by the end she was really happy with it."
"Amazing!
Amazing!
Amazing!Really a wonderful movie."
"Elsa and Anna are trazan's sisters 😨😱😱
But the movie is amazing, the music the grafics, everything"
"If Disney produced more movies like this, maybe people would actually go to their movies. The story was great. The animation was wonderful. You must at least stay for the duet with Elsa and her mother. Wonderful! The rest of the music is so -so. It sounds like all other Disney singers, little girls with little voices. They had one previous good singer, in Decendents, Christen Chenowith"
"The first was more for the kids with it's wild romantic fairy tale feel to it that just reels in the kids. This film is more sober and adult as it deals with the emotions and the mystery and fears. Some of the kids might not get that. But it is Olaf who is the kids guide into what is happening in the film. Also he provides the comic relief for the kids to laugh WITH (not ""at"").
The songs are not as good as the first but they can hold their own.
Technically this is a much better story than the first. I was expecting that there was something special about Anna and was not disappointed. I had just thought Anna had a power too since all the images and powers surrounding her and on her clothes are of spring time and warmth and growing things are the polar opposite of Elsa. But no, she doesn't have a power. But how the story ends takes full advantage that she is the opposite of Elsa and those two share a special connection.
The production is stunning and better than the first. Especially with the use of light and shadow and the production numbers with the songs. Those who are familiar with the history of Disney and what the artists were doing the fight scene in ""Bambi"" and the pink elephant sequence of ""Dumbo"" (ALA: very few lines to suggest a figure and your mind fills in the rest) will be delighted to see technique use here in just a few of the scenes as the snowflakes fall and settle.
The film is still highly enjoyable but not as a wildly romantic fairy tale as the first was."
"I still enjoyed it for many reasons, it's still Frozen first of all and I also enjoyed it for nostalgic reasons. I know it's not supposed to be like the first Frozen, the characters are getting older, but the age group that are watching them are not. For even me (a 15 year old) it was a little too complicated for a movie that isn't supposed to be . I liked the idea of bringing a bigger story than in the last one, but it was too complicated and dark for something you could enjoy. I get that the movie industry is changing, but they have to watch how they change the movies. Otherwise it was enjoyable, the songs were great as always, the evolution of the characters was a nice change. Besides the darker tone, I enjoyed it, for nostalgic reasons and because it was Frozen I give it and 8/10."
"I saw ""Frozen 2"", starring the voices of Kristen Bell-The Good Place_tv, Veronica Mars_tv; Idina Menzel-Glee_tv, Enchanted; Josh Gad-Murder on the Orient Express_2017, The Wedding Ringer; Jonathan Groff-Mindhunter_tv, Glee_tv and Sterling K. Brown-This Is Us_tv, Black Panther.
This is a sequel to the 2013 animated hit and yes, it is a musical, too. Kristen/Anna & Idina/Elsa are sisters, with Idina having the ice powers and being the ruler of their little village in the woods, since their parents' passing. Jonathan/Kristoff is the young lad that loves Kristen and Josh/Olaf is the lovable snowman/side kick that is the funny one of the group. There is an enchanted forest-that no one goes in or out of-that is right across the river and Idina thinks it holds the answers to questions she has about her past. So it's a road trip for the gang to discover how Idina got her powers in the first place. Or, I guess you could just call it her origin story. Sterling is a captain of the soldiers that knew Idina & Kristen's parents. If you can manage to keep your kids seated-good luck with that-until after the end credits, there is a bonus scene with Olaf.
It's rated ""PG""for some action and some peril and has a running time of 1 hour & 43 minutes.
I wouldn't buy it for myself-maybe for the grandkids-but it would be a good rental."
"The movie is a bit of a mixed bag. Overall, I liked it. I liked the songs. Who knows, if they'll have the same kind of phenomenon as ""Let it Go""...but I know I had ""Into the Unknown"" stuck in my head when we were leaving. I think the animation was beautiful. But, I think the slight downside was the story. Tonally, this movie was trying to go mature. There are themes of death, growing up, separation. And that's not a bad thing. I was even excited to see the story take a bit of a darker tone. However, the emotions never really hit me. Inside Out was a movie that I think excellently hit that mark, but I never really had that moment here. And the film focuses so much on the past. Like literally the new adventure they are on is about finding out secrets of the past. And I think the muddles the story a bit. It's hard to go into it more without giving away spoilers, but I found there was elements that didnt make sense from what we had seen or been told to us. Also there's nothing wrong with Kristoff's song itself but they choose to style it like a cheesy boy band music video. And like....it was funny...but also tonally felt weird. Again, you're taking the story in a more serious tone....and then this comes out. Like, its fine with Olaf. He's the comic relief and all. But, I dont know...this part just felt weirdly out of place with the movie. And because there's also this theme of separation, the trio literally gets separated from each other. And when Kristoff finally popped on screen again towards the end to help Anna, I swear in my head it was like ""Oh yeah....Kristoff is in this"".Again, I overall did really like it. I know it doesnt sound that way, by all my complaints above. But even though I found the story messy at times, I still liked where it was trying to go. And there was still good lighthearted moments, and funny Olaf moments. Oh and I want a water horse, so theres that."
"Frozen 2 is a worthy follow-up to the original. It had a great story that explored the history of Arendelle and how Anna and Elsa's parents passed away. The film saw Elsa, Anna, Kristof, Sven and Olaf embarking on a mission to find the enchanted forest and ultimately saving it and Arendelle. These five characters all had their time to shine. The camaraderie between these characters was truly perfect and was one of the reasons why I enjoyed this sequel.Olaf is the funniest character in this sequel. I actually found him much more funnier and adorable in this movie. The movie takes place one year after the events of the original and the character Olaf has grown into a sort of man-child who tries to answer all of these life altering and serious questions. In the previous movie, Olaf was more goofy and acted carelessly to almost everything. I adored the scene where Olaf tried to reenact the events of the first movie, thus reminding the audience in case they had forgotten.The ending where Anna and Elsa now rule two separate kingdoms showcases how far these characters have grown and evolved. Anna was always overprotective of Elsa and did not want to lose her. Now, they both live in separate kingdoms and send little notes and messages back and forth. To me, the ending was wonderful.The post credits scene was hilarious. It showed Olaf reenacting the events of the sequel. He left out quite a few key moments, but it was still a joy to watch.Frozen 2 had amazing songs where I wanted to sing along. However, the songs are not as catchy as the songs from the original. ""Into the Unknown"" may be the new ""Let it go"", but unfortunately not as catchy and addictive.The song Kristof and partly Sven performed was perfect and hilarious. Kristof's failed attempts throughout the movie to propose to Anna was hysterical and cracked me up. Eventually, he was able to propose to her and it was one of the sweetest and cutest moments of the entire movie.The scene where Olaf was erased from Elsa's memory was quite sad and bittersweet. Due to this ""death"", Anna had a epiphany that the dam had to be destroyed, in order for the enchanted forest to be free.To conclude, Frozen 2 is one of my favorite animated movies of the year. It did not disappoint and exceeded my expectations. The movie had emotion, comedy, drama and action. It was a feel good movie and definitely worth your time."
"This was a thinly veiled pc anti-Thanksgiving tale. Anna taught small children how to ""save the world"" with environmental terrorist tactics. Storyline was more interesting than 1st movie but had much more boring music. My 8 year old was bored halfway thru and asking for it to be more like the first."
"Loved this movie. It's a more mature version of the first one and a bit darker. Even more quirkiness and fun comic relief from Olaf. The music is good, might not be the ear worms of the first one but maybe more important for the storyline."
"I went into this with my son expecting another great Northern adventure featuring these two Nordic sisters and their fun entourage. The movie was enjoyable, included some new catchy songs and quirky humor, not to mention beautiful animation and visuals, but I found the plot to be a bit forced and confusing. And the third act completely rushed.Don't read more unless you've seen the movie. So all is well in Arendelle, and we learn of a history of how Anna and Elsa's parents met, and a curse that has befallen a mystical forest where a native group of people live. Elsa hears a voice calling to her from the North so she feels compelled to find it believing it'll teach her about why she has her frosty powers. All this is good and interesting until we are introduced to this little fire lizard who's quite adorable but almost kills everyone in the village. The fire seems to be portrayed as this evil and the villain of the movie as Anna almost dies trying to save Elsa as she runs to fight the fire...only to discover it's being caused by a cute little GOOD lizard. This makes little to no sense to me. Then there's a wind goddess or spirit that blows things around but never seems to have a part in the story, also doesn't make sense. There's huge rock giants that seem to be evil as everyone hides when they're first introduced but by the end they end up being good as well even though they came inches away from flattening Anna. And then we have Elsa making her way across a frigid and unforgiving sea to this frozen island to find the source of the sound. While we learn about her past, it is never truly explained who was calling her. She's frozen into ice when she gets there too which didn't really make sense since she's sorta immune to that. Anna realizes that her grandfather is the reason for the curse so she decides to lift it by breaking the dam, even if it means flooding her kingdom. The curse is suddenly lifted and Elsa, wearing a new dress and riding a water horse which is also not explained somehow manages to get to Arendelle to stop the oncoming flood. It took them the entire movie to get to where she was and she gets back in about 5 seconds. I'm sorry, that part was ridiculous, even for a children's movie. I think it would've made more sense for Arendelle to have been destroyed to teach the lesson that sometimes we must sacrifice what we love to save others. But in today's world I guess lessons like that are old school.
While it may sound like I'm complaining the movie wasn't horrible, I just expected so much more from it. In addition, we learn that Elsa got her powers because her mother saved their father who was an enemy out of love. So I would like to think Anna saving all of them by lifting the curse would award her with powers of her own, I mean, she's very deserving especially since she thought she was sacrificing Arendelle to do it, and yet she gets nothing from the magical spirits for this. It left me shaking my head.
Not as good as the first."
"First, the good: The animation and rich personalities of the characters prevent this movie from falling apart. That's it. That's all that is good in this movie. It will, of course, please children and sell products on this basis alone.Now, the bad: Disney is starting to make the mistake of being ""statement driven."" For example, Disney purposefully removed Rafiki's wonderful plot-pivotal line in the non-animated Lion King, ""Ah, yes, the past can hurt. You can run from it or learn from it."" presumably because so much of ""me-too"" is based upon the past. Here, it's a different message: it is about human abuse to the environment.There is very little chance that a small child will understand the message (not that it matters). The story-line is way too complicated. I did not even understand it until I reflected upon it.There are two cultures, ""civilized"" and ""nature""; the nature culture trusts the civilized culture, but the leader of the civilized culture (being the ascendant grandfather) kills the defenseless leader of nature's culture, by betraying a trust. This breaks harmony and Elsa needs to bridge the natural elements with the civilized culture. Elsa is the bridge and, based upon a new framework, there is new hope for harmony between nature and civilization.When you think about it reflectively, the allegorical plot can be comprehended, but not really during the movie, the abstract villain is too diffused, and the pieces are introduced in way that the viewer is not invested or attached to the message.The songs are pleasant without the same wonderful hooks.My two 10 year olds left the theater loving it, and so did my 13 year old. But, my wife said negatively, ""I didn't understand most of what was going on or why."" Neither did I, until I thought about it. Too late... Even if I watch it again, it will still be a pleasant movie, no more or less than a straight-to-DVD movie, but that's about it.Frozen (I) is a masterpiece. Not here. But, of course, it all depends upon how that term is defined..."
"Frozen II is not frozen (I) but it sure delivers. The movie starts off slow, but quickly avalanches into a flurry of fun. It has strong comedic elements much more than the first, but keeps one on the edge of their seats with action packed scenes. There's mystery to be unraveled, what will Elsa, Anna, Olaf, Sven and Kristioff do! as we see their return each one has an equal part in this adventure."
"This movie was cute. It accomplished what it set out to do: entertain. It's a kids' movie. I honestly don't care about the depth of the story or the similarities to other shows/movies. There were a few laugh out loud moments and jokes directed towards parents. (Kristoff's song in the woods? Hilarious!) My kids enjoyed seeing their favourite characters in a new story and that's all that matters to me! The animation was beautiful, the music was good and what the story lacked in depth was made up by the entertainment value."
"I expected something less. I was disappointed. I loved it. The new songs are amazing and the new adventure is really good. Had a blast ""into the unknown"". Really recommend it!"
"Frozen II is a solid follow-up to the first film that though isn't better, still was very entertaining throughout. The story was fun and endearing seeing how exactly Elsa got her powers and use it to a full advantage. The bond between Elsa and Anna is still phenomenal and the back-bone that holds this franchise together. The supporting cast, new songs, and breathtaking animation were also good qualities to make it stand out. I'm not joking, ""Show Yourself"" is the next ""Let It Go"", I don't care what anyone states, that song was so GOOD! I will note the third act was somewhat clunky and the ending did rub me the wrong way but this sequel did manage to give me most of what I wanted. I was content with the outcome and for that, I will never let go of my love for it..... ;)"
"I think this movie is amazing
With powerful story and powerful character, now they're growing up. And the visuals effect is eye popping, also the song is memorable.
Only one things that disappoints me, the runtime is very short, I think it'll be better if the runtime is 2 hours or 1h 50m!"
"FROZEN 2 REVIEW :-Frozen released in 2013 was surprisingly an awesome film and also went to gain so much praise from the audience. The praise made it earn more than Billion dollar at Global box office and since then the sequel kept us all excited. Frozen sequel had to make some promises of living upto the prequel in terms of Story, Presentation, Visuals and most importantly connect with the audience. Here comes Frozen 2 fulfilling all the promises that Frozen sequel have made or should have made.
Frozen 2 takes forward the story of 2 sisters Anna and Elas from the predecessor. Anna and Elsa recall their Father and Mother story from childhood and are eager to find the truth from the past. Therefore Anna, Elsa, Kristoff, Olaf and Sven leave Arendelle to travel to an ancient, autumn-bound forest of an enchanted land. They set out to find the origin of Elsa's powers in order to save their kingdom. In this adventurous ride there are a lot of funny moments, twists, emotions, curiosity and then there is a Super happy ending.The narrative of Frozen is short, sweet and simple. May be that's the reason it looked slightly less than what people are expecting from the Frozen sequel. Ultimately the same thing makes it Pacy and engaging as well, hence there should not be any complaints of falling short to the mark unless the expectations are damn too high. Visually Frozen is truly Phenomenal. Couple of sequences such as Climax scene and that Sea Crossing scene takes it even higher. Screenplay is terrifically engaging with a runtime of around 100 minutes and that never leave you with a single boring moment. The height of expectations can never have a limit when it comes to computer animated films because the scope is unlimited in this fictional world with no real characters attached to it, hence Frozen 2 might look slightly less than whatever it could have been. But the directors Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee delivers a promising sequel despite all this burden. They get the execution right with their vision whether it is storytelling, connect or VFX.To round it off, Frozen is a beautiful sequel to a beautiful film which we saw 6 years ago. The gap was quite long yet it doesn't fail to please you. Frozen 2 has everything in right manners whatever any good animated film should have. Perfect story, a new world, lovable characters, phenomenon visuals, strong bonding between characters, emotions and then a happy ending, Frozen 2 has got all these things in one watch for you and your family. Talking about the Box Office, this one looks another Bonafide blockbuster for Disney. Go and Freeze yourself for gorgeous 100 minutes.RATING- 6/10*"
"Frozen 2 is a very odd sequel, and it's obvious from the get-go that it was heavily edited and rewritten throughout its production. For example, I was watching an ad on TV for one of the toy tie-ins for the film, and in the toy ad, Anna has a sword, when there is no sword in the movie. There probably was one earlier in the script, but they must have changed that recently.Also, on the deluxe soundtrack on Google Play, there are 4 outtake songs, like fully produced musical numbers that weren't in the finished film. So I'm sort of wondering how much of the story has changed and why those things were changed.So the plot of the film once again centres around Anna and Elsa. Elsa begins hearing a mysterious call coming from the wilderness, but nobody else can hear it, which Elsa finds quite concerning. But Elsa does her magic stuff and accidentally curses Arendelle, making the city uninhabitable, and so Anna and Elsa (and Olaf, Kristoff and Sven, who tag along as more-or-less comic relief and no other reason) to figure out why this weird stuff has happened.So the core theme of the story is about historical legacy and change. Essentally, Elsa and Anna discover their grandfather was responsible for an act of betrayal that started a war between Arendelle and the tribe Northuldra, a group of people who live in a forest filled with elemental spirits. This war then caused the spirits to wall off the forest, keeping everyone inside forever, until Elsa and Anna come to save the day. This I felt was a very interesting premise, in that its about how we are not beholden to the mistakes of our ancestors, and that we can make positive change if we acknowledge what had happened, why it happened, and how to fix it. There are some very pressing social issues in current affairs that this moral directly applies to, so teaching kids this moral is a great idea.However, for the most part, this film is a bit messy. It has great highs, but also some not so great lows. Certain characters, in particular Kristoff, have basically nothing to do for the entire film. Kristoff spends the entire story trying to propose to Anna, but this has zero relevance to the rest of the story, or the other characters' arcs. It's just a thing that is happening at the same time for some reason. Also, there are some weird creative decisions regarding Elsa that seem to go against the point of the first Frozen film. Elsa's arc in the first film was learning to accept herself for who she is, and allowing her loving family in at the same time (something something gay metaphor), while in Frozen 2, Elsa's plot revolves her discovering her origins, rejecting her role as queen of Arendelle, and becoming the fifth elemental spirit of the forest, while almost dying in the process. This is basically her returning to square one, the whole 'Let it Go' moment in the first film is validated and shown to be Elsa's true path, after she tried to be a good queen of the people at the end of the first film.To end this review on a good note, this movie is still really fun to watch. The animation is spectacular, the scene in the trailers is great, and by far the best part of the film. There are two really good Elsa numbers, and Kristoff gets a good song too, even though his B-Plot is pretty much irrelevant. The rest of the songs (one Olaf song and a couple Anna songs) are decent but nothing to write home about. I wouldn't say it's better than the first, but it's pretty close, and Into the Unknown is waaaaay better than Let it Go."
Love the songs and can defo imagine a stage production of this film. The story is more grown up and parts will go over the heads of younger ones. My little boy who is 5 got a bit restless but managed to stick with it. Really want to go back and watch again without the distraction of lots of fidgety children LOL.
"Six years have passed. And so the sequel came out. And it turned out good. Weaker than the first part, but still good. So what's in there?Heroes have matured. It is interesting to observe how Elsa is torn between royal duties and the desire to understand and curb her abilities. How Anna turns from frivolous into a loving, attentive and caring girl and her sister. How Kristoff learns to forgive and put up with Anna's choice and prepares for the crucial step! Even how Sven helps his best friend in difficult decisions. And all this is good, but ... That's all.It cannot be said that the first part, for all its merits, somehow struck the imagination with its scenario merits. No, everything was simple and clear, history knew its worth. The main plot of ""Frozen 2"" is a whole nothing: the characters of the entire film go from point A to point B, in the end to come to the classic conclusions for Disney. The plot in the sequel is just an excuse for the existence of the sequel, which does not work in any way, except for the banal desire of the studio to earn more and more on the already cult brand. Not a single song came close to Let It Go, and no new character was remembered.But the fan service has worked wonderfully. Even realizing all the disadvantages of the film, I still enjoyed it. By the way, who is Samantha?"
"I wouldn't say this is better then the original, but i would it's just as enjoyable. I think this is a great ending to this story. But if there were more to come it would also make sense since this plot did open up more opportunities to discover more of the magic."
"It lacked plot that wasn't singing, and as a result seemed too short, on the plus side it was at least funny"
"Nicely made for the target audience: Kids. The 1st half was full of rhymes&songs, the climax with the water horse ride was just a fantastic visual experience especially watching it in IMAX 3D, scenes like these would trigger the kids' imagination skill to a different level altogether, its a must watch for kids that love or even kids don't love cartoons."
"This is my first review and for me to do a review on Frozen 2, it really meant something for me. For someone who hated the original Frozen, this sequel was quite impressive. Really liked the songs, especially by Panic! At The Disco & Weezer. The story was interesting too."
"Great story, esp abt their mom and dad and how elsa got her magic, but the songs was kinda awkward, not catchy, cant remember any if it when i leave the theatre."
"Because of how popular the songs were in the first one Disney decided to make frozen 2 a musical, which wouldn't be a problem if all the songs weren't so bland (nothing was nearly as catchy as let it go), the only song that I thought was alright was lost in the woods and you hear a better version covered by weezer in the credits. I thought the plot was alright, nothing amazing but nothing terrible. If it wasn't for the fact that they sing every two minutes with a lame song I would have rated it higher. Also there is an end credit scene that I loved so stay till after the credits are done"
"Well I haven't seen Frozen so I don't know if I would have enjoyed this film more if I had. However that meant I could enjoy this film based purely on its own merits without being swayed.I really liked Kristoff and thought he was one of the highlights of the film. He had some really funny bits and was just very likeable. He and Sven his reindeer amused me. Sadly he wasn't in the film enough for my liking. The other highlight of the film was Olaf. Olaf is just a very funny and sweet character and thank god for him and for Kristoff because they brought the humour to this film and I had a couple of out loud giggles. There could have been so much more though and the jokes and fun are what I love about Disney films so for it to be so lacking was really disappointing.The princesses were your usual Disney princesses but for me that's it.There was a huge amount of singing and all of the songs were very similar and none had me really enjoying it or thinking ""wow this is going to be big"". When I think of the songs from other Disney films like The Little Mermaid or Jungle Book this one came nowhere near. All of the songs were big ballads and just very average.My niece has told me that Frozen is amazing so when I visit her at Christmas I'll be watching it with her and then I'll know if seeing it would have change any of my thoughts on this film but apart from knowing the characters a bit better I cannot see how it would affect the rest of the issues I had with it."
"Stunning animation with boring and weak story. There are so many unanswered questions. 1) Queen Iduna saved Agnar and then married to him. But Agnar didn't know who saved him from the forest. Did Iduna never tell him? 2) If Elsa's powers comes from her mother why Anna doesn't have powers either?
3) Why Elsa stays in enchanted forest. Yelana is already leader of Northuldra people."
It better than the first one. The story and detail was very good! Music was greater then the first one. This was the good development. Everything was perfect! I very like it.
"I saw this movie twice it was so amazing. I would say it's got a bigger and stronger bond than the first one with Elsa and Anna and I was very emotional with this film. I'm glad they made a sequel, it's a great escape from all the negativity in this world as well. The animation is incredible and the soundtrack is even better than the first."
The reviews make me laugh the whole point is the storyline is such a child can follow it has it all the room was packed and all the little ones loved as thats the main market for the movie that said i also loved it it is a great movie and the haters gona hate but as i say its for the kids.........
"I thought it was good because of the new adventure the characters take to free the encanted forest. Elsa got an upgrade. Anna shows real leadership. Kristoff and Olaf are fun to watch. Got a little sad, but it ended happy."
Wauw what a great movie! I loved every second of it. Please go and see the movie. You have to!
"This movie was overall amazing. Plot was okay but it lacked a few things. There's no explanation on why the voice calls to Elsa... I think it's just a random thing. Also the scene where Anna and Elsa find their parents' ship in the middle of a ditch was unnecessary also. So in the 1st film, the ship sinks in the middle of the water! How on earth would Elsa and Anna find it when there's no water in the ocean? Makes no sense. That scene didn't need to be in the film. Elsa could have found information in the books and easily the film could still continue without the voice calling her.The whole thing about building the dam and the grandfather threatening them with it didn't make sense to me and the fact that building the dam would hurt the tribe people. The writers could have done a better job on that and found out a different approach to find island Ahtohallan without the parents ship scene. The trolls could have maybe told Elsa about it since they know everything about the past. I also don't get when Anna nreaks the dam Elsa comes back to life? Why would the dam make her come back anyway?Another thing... take out Olaf's song and Christoff's song.But other than those issues... The story was great. If those issues would have been fixed I would give this a 10. It's still a fun movie"
"But the ending was a bit rushed, there was some boring parts. Kristoff's song was the best song, the other ones are just annoying or depressing. Visuals great, story a bit complex for children...expected more, but it's ok."
I love this movie very much thought it was better than the first one and it was a very emotional and amazing movie can't wait to buy it on Blu-ray
Frozen 2 story is very good. I like this story. Elsa character is mainly I like it.
"This probably is not an actual spoiler but the biggest turn of events in the Frozen sequel is that Elsa gets a magical new dress. She got a magical new dress in the previous one, too, and that sold well to all little girls.Going in, nothing else needs to be known about the movie as that already tells you whether seeing it is your cup of tea or not. Except maybe that no need to worry about another year-long round of Let It Go as no new song is even remotely memorable."
"I loved the story, the development of the characters, the songs, visuals - everything!Rarely does a film capture me emotionally but I shed a few tears during this film. It's beautifully written.I absolutely loved it and can not wait to watch it again.Disney got this one absolutely spot on and it was worth the wait. Well done Disney, my favourite film of 2019."
"Not a bad movie. The animation is great, the songs are okay, and the story is meh.It's not as good as the original, so why make it? If you're making a sequel you expect things to be different and have some impact on the story, but at one point in the movie all of their problems start solving themselves easily. I won't spoil it, but it's quite convenient for the story.It's tone isn't very uniform, it tries to appeal as a more serious story (with some comedy sprinkled in) but it ultimately fails to live up to its own aspirations and never follows through.My rating: 7/10"
It was worth the wait. Idk know if it has any classics like let it go this time around but it did not disappoint
"Wow! I didn't expect much, didn't see much previews and OMG!! It was perfect from beginning to the end. Laugh, love, excitement, suspense, action, music, the story.... Everything was perfect! Not too long, not to short. Wow again! Olaf should get an award!!! So funny! Lol
Seriously, soo good for kids and adults. :)"
This movie is all out a really great movie 10 out of 10 would see again great movie. Would definitely say you should watch this movie
"Frozen 2 (4 out of 5 stars).Frozen 2 is a good family fantasy sequel that surprises with stunning animation, visuals, and a story about an enchanted land. It may not have a memorable musical sequence like the first movie or a story with a predictable villain. The film's story focuses on themes like Where did Elsa get her powers? Where was there parents travelling too? And a little back story about how the enchanted lands became cursed with its powers and magic.The plot follows Anna, Olaf, Kristoff, And Elsa travelling to an ancient land. That is calling out to Elsa. And causing trembles and shakes in their kingdom.The plot is good. Questions gets answered about Elsa and their parents. It may not be a strong story like the first movie. But still magical and beautiful with the visuals.The animation is wonderful. The visuals and cinematography is beautiful. Plot may be weak but you will be distracted with the beautiful animation which makes up for the movie. The film has a lot of new musical sequences. Couple of songs are great. May not be as memorable like the first. The direction is a little darker with its story.Overall, Frozen 2 is a good sequel. The characters are fun. The film explores the story a little more about a magical enchanted land. The animation and visuals are stunning and beautiful."
"Don't come with high expectations, I came to the cinema expecting a fine movie, and came out feeling good. Not as good as the first, but you can't say it wasn't worth the long wait for the movie. It has some problems, but the animation is GREAT and the songs are good."
"It was very nice to watch. In some cases it was better than the first one.
Songs wise, cannot top the first one."
"This movie was just horrible. Why did they even bother with a sequel? The fact that we later found out that Anàl and Elias'  was pretty cool, but that was it. The wriring? Horrible. The scenes with Anà and Elisé? Too much of them. Give us an Olaf spinoff where it's summer and he somehow survives the entire season."
"In the highly-anticipated sequel to one of Disney's most beloved movies, we find Arrendelle in a rather peaceful time. But Elsa is sensing a mysterious call up North and doesn't feel like she belongs in Arendelle. One night, magical forces force the citizens of Arrendelle out of Arrendelle and they realize that the only way to fix it is for Elsa to go up North as well as trying to figure out the origins of Elsa's magical abilities. (Sorry, I suck at summaries. MUCH better than how this sounds).
Where does one start? The animation was quite excellent and top notch, and the story quite engaging. This is darker and more intense than the first one and explores the Frozen verse's mythology and magical side of things in more depth. The music score is amazing! Haunting in some ways, and the music itself is simply a sweeping epic score. The songs are really, really awesome and I was singing along with them in theaters today.
The acting was awesome and there are several twists and turns and some heavy emotional stuff. The themes are great and surprisingly teenage/adult for a Disney movie.
There were some scenes that I couldn't help but compare to the MCU - if you see it, you'll know what I'm referring to. Still, it doesn't hinder in any way from the sheer spectacle this movie is.
And when you go see it (if you do) make sure to watch it in 3D - trust me, it's so worth it."
"I enjoyed myself with this one.First off, this is one of the BEST looking animated movies of all time. It is simply gorgeous looking. The visuals have an excellent use of color and nature. I love that they decided to set this in autumn, which is something you don't often see in animated films. In contrast to the more traditional fairy tale look of the last film, this one is far grander looking. The appearance of the kingdom of Arendelle in this makes the original look so-so.Frozen II feels so different from any other Disney animated film. There are plenty of those that do fantasy, but this is the first one (except maybe for The Black Cauldron) to go for EPIC fantasy. I really loved the various legitimately challenging magical forces the characters have to deal with.The story looks into how Elsa (voiced by Idina Menzel) has her powers and I really liked the setup and the messages they were trying to tell. This is actually one of the more serious Disney animated films. (By their standards. Don't worry there's still plenty for your kids to love.) There are a couple surprisingly dark, dramatic moments. (Again, by Disney standards.)Based on the trailers, I was afraid that comic relief Olaf the snowman (voiced by Josh Gad) wouldn't fit into the change of tone on account of being too light, but the writers adapted the character really well. They have him growing up and being far more philosophical about the world (while still being pure). His musings often steal the show. I actually thought he was funnier in this than the last film.I did think this movie had some pacing issues. The plot just isn't as tight as the first one. There are moments where the writer didn't know how to best utilize the main characters. I do wish they spent more time interacting with a couple of the film's likable but underused new supporting characters.Songs are decent but aren't on the same tier as the last film. Half are just okay. The song Into the Unknown tries too hard to be the new Let it Go. Still, I give the songwriters credit for going with a new style not found in previous Disney films. I liked Show Yourself, Lost in the Woods, and All is Found. The last one is a particularly lovely piece.This isn't quite as good as the original, which knew more what it wanted to be and had a stronger emotional backbone. Still, this has a lot going for it and I think your kids will like it."
"Now people can be cynical with the film and think this is a cash grab but although it might seem that way there is a compelling story to be told. Now I'm just going to get this out of way, the animation is exquisite. The detail of the trees, the hair, the water it is all just incredible. Now as to the story itself I like the esthetic that they were going for. It was more mystical, and this something that I personally tend to walk towards. The relationship of the sisters is also one of the underlying stories which I also liked. However, the film is more focused on Elsa, and this is where things tend to be a little divisive for me. Because the mystical part of the film, which is something that I love, is directly connected to Elsa. The unfortunate thing is this overshadows Anna's character development, yes she has 1 or 2 good scenes but it is minimal in comparison to her sister's. It is a shame because she has a very important role by the end of the film. And I don't think that her arc wasn't enough to fill such a role. Now the film was structured more differently from the 1st one because in this film it seemed that they went for a more theatrical structure and it almost as if as they want to turn it into a musical. This leads me to think that the songs, however good they were, feel like they were forced towards us hoping that they could replicate the success of Let It Go and have kids singing it non-stop. Don't get me wrong the songs were great I even thought that they made a great choice of having Weezer and Panic at the Disco have their rendition to 2 of the songs. But it just feels like they were clamoring to have a redo of the success of the 1st one.
All in all, I thought the film was a good watch. Families and especially children will love the film. In times it does feel like it is too much but it certainly wasn't awful. I this will spark debate but I actually preferred this one compared to the 1st one."
Watched with me and my family and I can say movie was sooo crappy with songs every 10 mins. I believe there were more then 10 songs and most of it were irritating and boring. The plot was soo thin with no purpose. It is a very bad sequal in my honest brutal opinion. Do watch it if you want to sleep.
"It's Frozsn 2 everyone, this second installment for this franchise is great it's not bad and I felt it's made for the fans of this movie rather than pleasing kids. You gotta really watch the first movie before you catch on with this one and it basically covers up most of the plot holes they had left on the first movie. While some people say it might be anti-climatic but the climax doesn't had to be bombastic as and action type, it's just pure love of Elsa's Mum and finding the truth about what had really happened and this adds more depth for the movie.Well for some people the might had dislike about the too much songs and not related, but goddamn this movie is all about the music, Into The Unknown is similar to Frozen's Let It Go, also to mention Show Yourself and these songs been getting a lot of momentum and hits from the fans and Im sure it's goona be playing in the radio for couple of years and artist from all over the world will get a cover of their own. It's remarkable what a film song could do.Also for their characters, Elsa dress also played a big role we could spectate the evolving dress and hairstyles it's feels so empowering and bold from Elsa, while Olaf still shines brightly in this movie adding more humour to the movie, same goes for Anna and Sven, love story that part felt a bit too forceful but it's fine.As for he animation it's spot on, it's a Disney movie anyways, their animation team had always done a marvelous job especially on the magical water horse and it's great if you get a chance to watch in an IMAX 3D!Overalls it's a great movie, it's a great addition for Frozen fans, it's a great movie to laugh at and amazing animations and all the great songs to give more memories for the fans !"
"Disney, once again, did a wonderful thing with visual and Elsa dress. AMAZING.
However, because all of the songs were good, none of them stood out and made people obsessed like Let it go.
Storyline were pretty normal, that you could or have read/watched somewhere. The positive change which I like were the character development of all character."
"The first movie was a big surprise, no one in Disney imagined the popularity it would have, the merchandise sold out days after the premier and the restocks took forever. This had to be what everybody was hoping for and in a way it is, I never expect the second or third movie to beat the first because it does so only a few times. That being said the movie had beautiful amazing graphics, a good plot (for a kids movie) that gives the first picture continuity, catchy songs and a few good cute jokes."
"Yes, for sure, it does not match with the first part - as usual for most of the sequels.. because, as in other movies, first part is more human than the other ones.. second part relies on more magic and technology than human emotions.. so, it does not touch your heart.. but still, it is definitely fun watch if you like Disney movie patterns.. and if you have a girl child, then its a must watch"
"I loved the movie. The animation and Soundtrack were amazing, and the story was pretty nice, though it was also pretty predictable, which doesnt really bother me, its a childrens movie, so its to be expected. I think the story was a little too complicated for the length of the film, so it feels a little rushed, but I really enjoyed it.All in all, the movie is great, I really enjoyed it and I recommend that people go watch it, though the story is predictable, its still pretty entertaining."
"7/10 - despite being a pale comparison to its predecessor, this movie knows how to keep it fun for its ever-changing demographic while diving into deeper, more complex themes"
"I'm putting 10 stars because it's frozen and I will always love it, no matter what... However, there are a few things that felt off, specially at the end of the movie. I don't wanna reveal anything, but Elsa's character made some decisions she would've never made based on her own personality... anyway, the animation is amazing, the song ""show yourself"" is perfection (would watch the movie 200 times just to see that scene again), and the character development of Anna is great. Also, Olaf is funny and adorable, but Kristoff's story felt a little forced... anyway, it is a remarkable sequel and I hope people love it as much as the first one. That's my humble opinion."
"It was just brilliant, had everything you want, laughter, tears and of course an amazing soundtrack! Can't get the songs out of my head! I loved it! So much better than the first!!?"
"The trailer has a dark sense and I felt it in the film. I thought that this isn't as soft-noted fairy tale as the first one. But the graphics were awesome. When I saw the water gushing to the fjord, I was like, maaan, that seemed real water. You can easily say that the animation on this was definitely an upgrade.The film is visually and emotionally fuller. Olaf was hilarious. But the songs aren't as catchy as the first. Still, wonderful movie from Disney."
"I absolutely loved the new movie.
The first one is a typical Disney fairytale, the new one feels like a real movie.
Image is amazing, there are some fun songs but also some excellent songs. I really like Anna's song towards the end."
"It took them six years to come up with this sequel, so one would think that this iteration would have the benefit of a well-planned, thoughtfully-paced and emotionally-satisfying film that would rival the greatness of its predecessor.Instead, it seems time has become somewhat of a burden to the story and its characters' development as one scene stumbles on to the next in an attempt to create a unique story. And while it succeeds in this regard, one can't help but think the plot overthought and muddled. Brough about no doubt by the FIVE contributors to its' screenplay.Still, visually the film is as magical as it ever was, even grander in some instances which makes the whole experience worthwhile sitting through a theater with loud and fidgety children all around.With regards to the music, there was an inorganic nature to the way they were presented, seemingly coming out of nowhere in some instances. While there will no doubt be a glut of YouTube sing-alongs and covers with the various toe-tapping and range-testing tracks, sadly there is no ""Let It Go"" level track here. And perhaps that's for the best.Fans of the original should come into this with a grain of salt and expect something of a letdown, which is expected. Following up a mold-breaking, trope-defying first chapter is a tall order for anyone."
"Twice better than Frozen, this movie has it all and more. Bravo to the creators and cast, super super super nice for all ages. Rarely do I feel emotions pour out from an animated film, but this one was so powerful, so subtle, so involved. You'll love it."
"When ""Frozen II"" teaser trailer came out I was very nervous of what the sequel may hold. I was very confused and barley had any high hopes for the sequel. I was unimpressed with the trailer thinking they have already ruined the magic for ""Frozen"" but BOY I WAS WRONG! This film was impressive, dark, and hilarious! Loved the new songs from the new film! And I got Terri eyed (almost into tears) three times! I recommend you to see this magical, heartwarming musical film! You'll enjoy it!"
"The main thing that is better in this movie compared to the first is that the graphics
And animation are amazing, so many breathe-taking scenes! Although there is a confusing plot with perhaps predictable reveal and plot twist that was also predictable. One thing that I disliked was the confusing arc they tried with Kristoff, what was supposed to be a big part of the movie was his proposal which the movie established in the beginning and then Kristoff basically disappeared for a good chunk of the movie after his song, the movie did nothing with Kristoff's relationship with Anna to set a foundation or at lease development with their relationship. Instead Anna and Elsas relationship was the main focus almost to the point where it was like Anna and Elsa should have just had the Romance cause it did nothing with Kristoff, also Anna is an awesome fun character while Elsa is a friendly Emo chick she doesn't give much personality but I guess that how here character was supposed to be also I really disliked that there was no set villain, it's just hero's discovering the past basically and that's it, despite everything the voice acting was incredible alongside the graphics and computer animation."
I love that movie. Including that Anna Saves Elsa twice in a row. Elsa gave her life to know the what really happened in the past.
"Better than the first!!! The songs are amazing, the story is more mature and darker than the first. It's also extremely hilarious!"
The story is beautiful and really matches with the first movie. Visually is perfect as well as the new songs. Magical
"Disney has done it again and this is probably one of their best this year. If you love Disney or Frozen, then you will love this movie.Storyline - The best improvement over the original as there are callbacks to the first movies, including a jab at Let It Go and our reactions to it. This was more Elsa's story as well, as we found out why she was born with powers. The story even debunks the Tarzan theory, revealing the heartbreaking fate about the parents. Anna receiving her powers was debunked, Olaf getting a girlfriend, Elsa getting a girlfriend or love interest, and there was no surprise villain. A lot of these were rumors and theories, but there is still a possibility of them happening.Music - The songs weren't as good as the first, but I love the music, especially 'Into the Unknown', 'All is Found', and 'Show Yourself'. Show Yourself feels more the new Let It Go, and the scene is so beautiful and emotional. I wasn't expecting the scene like that, but boy, the scene sent shivers down my spine.Animation - Just like the first movie, the animation was gorgeous, from the reflections of the eyes and the environment, to the details in the hair and environment, everything was perfect.Tone - The tone was perfect for a movie of this scale. I hate it when it animated movies are too kiddie like. There needs to be more emotion and darker themes in them, especially with villains. Villains are dark and making them kiddie like would lose their effectiveness.Voice Acting - Everyone did a great job, from Idina, to Kristen, to Josh, even Jonathan and Evan did a great job. The one that did the best in my opinion was Idina Menzel. She put so much emotion into her singing that it made Elsa stand out more. I can't really see anyone else do the voice of Elsa, as I'll imagine Idina voicing her. Kristan Bell was phenomenal and gave Anna more depth. Her song, 'The Next Right Thing' was the best I heard Kristen sing. She puts so much emotions into that song, that it make anyone tear up with her. Josh Gad is of course funny as the adorable Olaf. He steals every scene he's in. Evan Rachel Wood was great as Iduna, wish we saw more of her, but what she had to work with was amazing. Love Alfred Molina, but kinda wished they kept the same voice actor, but oh well.Future - Frozen 3 may happen and if it does, it most likely complete the story of Anna and Elsa. This movie left the door open for a sequel. If it does happen, I'm hoping this has the same tone as this oneIf you haven't seen Frozen II, go see it... it's a better sequel and honors the first movie. Definitely worth a second watch."
"A beautiful storyline that built off the original, going darker as the characters explored their true selves and what it means to be who they are. Kristoff is PHENOMENAL. BEST Disney prince ever. I laughed, I cried, my niece and nephew sang the songs the whole way home and for days after, I'm sure it'll continue. I loved how there could be more story to tell and how they resolved some main plots points from the first."
I not like this movie part one is better i feel boring.
"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)As you should know by now, I enjoyed Frozen more than I expected. Therefore, I was genuinely excited about its six-year sequel. It's one of the few movies in 2019 to which I went in 99% blind. I didn't watch a single trailer, I barely saw any images or small clips, and I didn't know anything about where the story was going. So, with my expectations moderately high, how did it perform? Very, very well. I'm going to write it straight away: I enjoy this sequel more than the original. For one simple reason: it possesses a more emotionally complex narrative, one which I think the target audience (basically kids) won't even fully understand.It's really hard to create an animated flick with a story that works for both adults and children. The best of the best are the ones that are able to almost tell two different narratives: one simpler for kids with basic life lessons, and another for adults with more profound themes. Frozen II doesn't reach this last level, but its layered screenplay allows for an exploration of Elsa's powers that I genuinely didn't expect. However, there's an evident downside to the extreme focus on Elsa's journey... The other characters are put aside with irrelevant subplots that only stretch the runtime a bit too much, and unfortunately, reach a certain point where out-of-character actions occur.There's even a period of time where a particular character simply vanishes from the story because Jennifer Lee and Chris Buck couldn't figure out what to do with it during the last act. Despite the subplots not being impactful or not being able to further develop its characters, I can't deny some sequences are entertaining and funny as hell. Olaf is the absolute MVP of the film, and just like in the original, he doesn't exactly have an arc. Nevertheless, he has one of the most hilarious sequences of the year. I cried from so much laughter. His song and a couple of scenes where Josh Gad goes all out are some of the funniest of the whole movie.The voice cast is once again perfect. Anna, Kristoff, and Sven are sort of along for the ride, with the trio only doing something useful in the last 15-20 minutes. Elsa is the real star of the show. From the opening shot to the last, it's all about her, and her powers' origin. It might get too convoluted for kids, but despite a few minor missteps, it's an extremely well-developed screenplay. With a remarkable build-up and some truly amazing songs, Elsa goes through several action moments where she showcases all that her magic can do. And it's visually mind-blowing. Like in the first film, the animation quality is extraordinary.They really put 200% effort into Elsa's magic sequences. From her running against a tide of waves to fighting against the four elements (water, fire, earth, and air), there are imaginative and incredibly entertaining scenes, which give the movie a level of entertainment superior to its predecessor. Put this together with the wonderful, powerful score, and you get a pretty epic film, scale-wise. I mean, Into the Unknown is not going to reach Let It Go's level of worldwide craziness, but it's a phenomenal song. It's even better hearing it while watching the actual scene play out. Both this one and Show Yourself have a build-up worthy of sending chills down your spine.All Is Found is also a memorable lullaby that a lot of parents are going to sing for their kids. When I Am Older is Olaf's hilarious musical moment that left me laughing throughout its entire run. I love Frozen II's score, more than the original's. That's something I genuinely wasn't expecting at all. Looking back, I now think the first installment doesn't even have enough significant songs. This sequel has tons of songs that are either extremely important for the characters or funny parodies. All are very captivating, catchy, and emotionally resonant. My advice: please, don't listen to the soundtrack before watching the movie. Not only the titles and lyrics offer plot spoilers, but they ruin that ""first experience"" feeling. I got chills during a couple of them precisely because I watched besides only hearing them.All in all, Frozen II compensates the six-year wait with a follow-up worthy of standing up to its original, which in my opinion, surpasses it. With an emotionally complex narrative, Elsa's powers are explored and developed in a captivating, creative, fun, and entertaining way. Disney really put their best animators on this because the quality of animation has never been as visually impressive as this. It really feels like a magical film. Elsa's magic demonstration plus the powerful, chill-inducing original score are two aspects that together provide some truly epic moments. However, Olaf is the MVP with a lot more screentime than in the original, and with a couple of the most hilarious scenes of the year. It's a shame that the focus on Elsa's arc pushed every other character aside, making them feel useless and with no exciting or impactful subplot. Runtime feels a bit stretched due to their side adventures, and exposition is pretty heavy throughout the entire duration. In the end, it's still a contender for Best Animated Feature Film of 2019."
"First things first: The children say that Frozen 2 is better than the first part. And the other cinema-goers from the target group also looked pretty enthusiastic. The sequel to the mega-success ""Frozen"", which has become a classic already is well received by the kids, that's for sure.From the parents' point of view, there is not much to complain about: The lovable snowman Olaf reliably delivers amusing wisdom and enigmatic jokes. Kristof and Sven are the reliable buddy duo, while Anna and Elsa are still best sister friends. The action is stirring, but pleasantly non-violent. All the more powerful are the pictures in which stone giants stomp through primeval forests, supernatural horses hunt untamed and wild across oceans and magical ice crystals form unreal universes. It is family cinema at Disney's best, technically at the height of what animation cinema is currently capable of delivering, perfectly suited to top off a cosey holiday Sunday during the festive days. And yet...The film critic in me can't help but find a few cracks in the supposedly flawless ice cover of this film. On the one hand, there is the story, which flows far less easy than the first part. Which was pretty straight forward, but not easy to understand in the first place, with its mixture of natural magic, lumberjack romanticism and double-crossing.However, in the eagerly awaited sequel, it becomes even more complicated. Elsa desires to follow a mysterious call from a land far, far away that leads her into an unreal forest, hidden behind a supernatural wall of fog. Of course, Anna and the gang accompany Elsa on her quest. Together they meet elemental spirits of unclear origin, two races involved in a fateful, never-ending feud, and a lot of reindeer. The secret of Anna-Elsa's family and the death of her parents is interwoven with all this, of course the kingdom is threatened, and besides that a marriage proposal has to be made.That is quite a lot of material for 100 minutes of film. Fortunately, Elsa's ice power not only turns out to be a powerful superhero ability. It also contains a handy ""explain-the-plot-to-me-device"". This makes it easier for the kids to follow the tangled story, but unfortunately it's not a very elegant storytelling technique. But the Disney filmmakers know how to conceal this weakness. And turn up the feelings to eleven times eleven. Frozen 2 is the movie for which the word ""emotional"" was invented. Every song of the protagonists, every battle of words between the sisters, every fateful narrative is presented with an elemental force that is unparalleled.This film doesn't play subtle strings. Instead, it works the audience like a kettledrum with thunderous blows, accompanied by epic images of gigantic boulders tearing craters into the landscape, monstrous tsunamis thundering through ravines and ice crystals raining like shooting stars from the sky.
It sure is a wild ride, not only for our heroine Elsa. Despite all the spectacle, she remains a fascinating and important female figure in Disney's modern canon. Elsa doesn't find fulfillment in a relationship but asserts herself as an independent, ultimately solitary heroine. Elsa and Anna, who rather corresponds to the role model of the classic Disney princess, are refreshing and inspiring role models, not only for the film world but especially for the many fans of this unequal sisterly team.Nevertheless, I don't need the third part of this saga. I don't think I can get emotionally through that..."
"Not too much a cartoons fan but i saw this one. amazing! songs, great plot, enough tension just to keep you curious....a big big Yes for those curious to see it."
"Beautiful soundtrack
Beautiful cast
Beautiful characters
Beautiful visual effectsEverything in this film was beautiful. It's definitely a worthy sequel.Thank you for making this sequel possible."
"The 8 year olds were restless and had nothing to say after the movie. They *loved* the original Frozen and still play with their dolls from the Disney Store. But this second movie left them cold (no pun intended). Maybe a too-complicated story line? Maybe not having even one memorable song? I was particularly unhappy with the semi-scary bedtime story told to the girls when very little at the movie's beginning by their father, followed by a scary bedtime song from their mother about a river in which they could drown. Then finding out that their grandfather cheated, lied to, and killed the indigenous magical peoples of the forest. What was Disney thinking? The computer graphics were great, that' s about all I can say on the positive side."
"Basically, what I took from ""Frozen II"" is that oftentimes, a society's official history is built on a mountain of lies. Read any book by Howard Zinn, Noam Chomsky or James Loewen to see what I mean."
"Movie was really fun, but became a bit messy in the second half."
I think personally I liked the first Frozen movie the best. The animation and music was great in this film too!! The characters are cute but would have loved to see more Olaf. Overall adorable animated movie!
"Very formulaic, predictable. Doesn't compare to the first movie."
"Story line is make me bored a litle, not as i expected, too much singing part..But still worth to watch especially if you like first movie."
"They tried too hard with this one, I think. The first 30-40 minutes is nothing but three different songs. Both Olaf & Kristoff have ridiculous plot points that were cringeworthy and didn't really fit the overall movie. Overall, it was overdone, a testament to the fact the sequels are not as good as the originals."
"This is my first time ever writing a review, but I find myself compelled to do so. I honestly wish I could have known this was basically going to be a musical. Literally about every 5 min a new song was starting. I honestly wanted more story than singing. The first movie didn't have as many songs. I found myself rolling my eyes each time a new song began. Don't get me wrong. Movie is visually beautiful. But I REALLY thought this movie was going in a different direction. That being said I never have to watch this movie again in life. Ever. Disney please stop making sequels and live action movies. Just come up with original content again."
"Hard to imagine it's the same filmmakers as the first one. Script is kind of a mess. Songs are pretty good, but not moving and amazing like first film. Animation is great of course. Not a bad movie, just a massive let down from first."
"There are a number of complaints in reviews of there not being enough plot, but that couldn't be farther from the truth. Following Frozen, we find Elsa and Anna in a relatively peaceful and happy place in their lives, but as a voice calls to Elsa, she struggles beyond the superficial self-acceptance of being out with her power to something much deeper in this breath-taking, often very grown up sequel. Elsa has to wrestle with who she is on a personal level as she tries to do the right things for both her people, Anna and herself, but throughout her journey, Anna is also trying to hold onto her sister and is faced with her own moment of self-discovery where she saves everyone without knowing whether if she'll ever get her sister back.From animation to brilliant arrangement, a very ambitious and heart-felt story is opened up. Personally, I think this movie accomplished all of the enjoyment you would expect aimed toward a child audience, while providing a more substantial message geared towards adults and especially young teens who grew up around the time of the first film. Themes surrounding grief, fear, and self-reliance are very prevalent throughout the film and I think it's one of the best accomplishments in recent memory of a Disney film. Deserves every star, brilliantly architected from visuals to score, and some of the tie-ins to the original create some really fabulous depth to each of the characters."
"I don't remember the first one being all that spectacular either. It just had the one hit song ""let it go"" and somehow the joint registered to a lot of people.
Personally not a fan of musicals and as far as the music goes in this I felt they were trying for another hit, but I definitely don't hear one. Could not stand any of the songs.
The only constant in the movie is the comedy genius that is Olaf. This snowman could have had his own feature (instead of the short he made a few years ago). The laughs were always on point, and his pure innocence makes him the most interesting character.
Frozen 2 has a story the world needs right now and I loved the ending, it was magical, but the built up to the end did not wow me as much as I was expecting.
It was an extra added bonus for me to see it in Imax. As far as the animation it was really cool"
"This epic may be a favorite for many people. The enchantment it brings has emotion to the storyline, and goes in deep. This breathtaking action epic is must see."
"With breathtaking animation, a wonderful new soundtrack, and outstanding character development, Frozen II hits all the right marks that a sequel should bring to the table and possibly even more. The voicework is as perfect as before, with all returning cast providing an equally impressive, if not superior, force to embody these now beloved characters. Sterling K. Brown as Lieutenant Destin Mattias provides for a great new performance as well, although not making too much of an impact, due to screen time with other characters. The film can also be very funny at times, and as with the first one, a large amount of that pleasant humor is due to Josh Gad's Olaf, who seems to truly outdo himself here, but in the best way possible. In comparison with the first in terms of story though, the film does seem a bit loose, and can be kinda thin when following, but despite that fact, it can also be ridiculously entertaining. As Disney does, the film doesn't hold back on any emotion and truly embraces these characters and their development with such care that it is truly captivating to watch. The film is sprinkled with good messages and will put a smile on your face. Frozen II doesn't deserve to be this good, infact, it may just be a better film than the first, but through sheer magic it achieves great quality on every remark, and does so with style.
My Rating: 9.25/10"
"This film has much of what made the first great: cute moments, memorable music, and plenty of humor.
In fact, it's safe to say this film was actually funnier than the first, with a lot more comedy from Olaf and some humorous moments from Kristoff.
A lot of thought was put into this sequel and it has great connections to the first film that help answer questions viewers may have had from it. As always in a Disney film, it has great teaching moments and lessons. The plot was interesting and not quite what viewers might expect.
There's a lot of exposition to start the film, but it's done in an interesting way and helps set up the rest of the movie pretty well. The film is well paced for the most part and keeps you engaged throughout.
With all this said, this film doesn't quite reach the standards of the original in some aspects. The music isn't quite as top notch (although it's still really good), the plot isn't quite as easy to follow, and it's just hard to match the magic from the first time we saw our main characters on screen.
The visuals are incredible, there's plenty of cuteness, and I again have to mention the humor because it was just great. Overall, a film great for slightly older kids that also has plenty for adults to enjoy, although not quite as impressive as the original Frozen."
"This movie was way different than the first which has both good and bad. The comedy in this movie was great, had my dying at some parts. The cinematography in this was magical, some very creative cinematography, for example, Kristoff's music video. The part where this movie struggled was the story. The main problem is the lack of rules set. This movie has a lot of mystical powers, but not enough laws and rules in this universe were established to make us have real fear, because we didn't understand the consequences. The climax was not very climactic. The physicalness was, but there was not enough internal conflicts or challenges to make the climax something special.It didn't get as emotional or interesting as the first, but in visuals, and comedy, it surpassed the first. The End. Like, comment, subscribe."
"First of all, from my last review everybody knows I'm not the biggest fan of the music from the first movie, mainly due to being overplayed and just annoying in my opinion, but this movie's music I can admit I really enjoyed it. This could be because I don't expect people to be singing ""Into the Unknown"" as much as ""Let it Go"" but no I actually really enjoyed the music and I think it's because not just one song had a message but a couple of them did. Although, I will admit there are 2 songs that could have been cut out because they kind of just brought the film to a halt. The score, once again done by Christophe Beck, was even a tiny bit better in this movie. The animation in this film, in my opinion, surpasses that of the first. There were so many shots in this film that were just gorgeous to look at and I wanted to see more of them. As much as I'm praising there are somethings that still bugged me about this movie like inconsistencies in the film that bugged me, one thing is even in the trailer. This movie definitely took what was good about the first movie and tried to make that same magic again and sometimes it worked like with the songs but in other, it didn't such as, with the plot twists. There are two ""plot twists"" if you can call them that because most people over the age of twelve can figure them out, in this movie and I get why we had them but at the same time they weren't as good as with Hans from the first. Once again, the voice cast in this is incredible from everybody and I love how they actually gave them character growth. In the end, Frozen 2 is a great family movie and a good follow up to the first. If you enjoyed the first one, you'll probably like this one."
"Disclaimer: I'm a 40-something dad of 3 boys who usually only likes movies with plenty of guns and explosions, so Disney Princess movies are not in my wheelhouse...But I liked the first one, and I liked this one just as much, although for different reasons.My advice is to leave your preconceptions behind and just enjoy the immersion. These characters are not going to repackage the same adventure as last time-instead, they continue to grow and develop in interesting new ways. Meanwhile, the world they live in continues to expand. The music and visuals are stunning, and the background of this world is enriched and expanded is interesting ways. Best of all, we get a story that Is compelling without being like anything that's come before-and that leaves you feeling real dramatic tension despite the fact that it doesn't follow a traditional narrative. It gets very dark at one point, which might be a little much for very young children-but for my youngest, who has been waiting for this since the original, it made the finale all that much more spectacular and rewarding. Personally, I just loved it. Never once did I feel it was something I'd seen a thousand times before. And the songs and visuals were really just amazing. Amazing!"
"I actually did enjoy this movie, and much appreciated the humor meant for adults. Olaf, in my opinion, stole the show and I loved it! One thing I was not impressed about was the fact that the whole movie was leading up to a climax and when it got to that point, I expected the movie to have another 45 min to an hour left. Instead it ended rather quickly and not how I expected. But it was good. And the after credit scene was great! It was a good way to end the Frozen Story."
"Disney has not had the best record of sequels, but I felt this movie really broke that mold.Note, I am an 18 year old guy, so I'm not exactly Disney's target audience for this movie :)With that said, this movie lives up to the dark tone the trailers gave us. I felt the music overall in this movie was a lot better than the first. I'd say the weakest part of this movie was the story, but even then, it is not the worst of a Disney sequel. The themes of this movie are awesome and this movie can even be tense at times. To sum it up, This movie is a lot bolder than the first"
The first Frozen was kind of a snoozer for me. My daughter has been obsessed by it since she was a baby but for me it was less impressive than Tangled and only marginally good.The new Frozen was a pleasant surprise. My now 4 year old daughter loved it but it was me who was laughing and smiling the whole way through the movie. The story is better than the reviews had led me to believe. There were real stakes and each of the main characters had a solid arc. The movie was visually stunning. Josh Gad holds the comedy crown now for a Disney movie because Olaf was absolutely hilarious and hit on kid level and adult level at the same time. Both my daughter and I left the theater feeling elated and at the end of the day that's what counts. This was a great family movie.PS: A lot of reviews complain that the new songs weren't 'memorable'. I have to applaud Disney for making new songs that worked but weren't 'memorable'. I couldn't live with a new 'Let It Go' earworm in my house for the next few years.
"If we look at it like normal western movie, it would be a straight story as ""found a threat, fix it, save everyone"". And the characters get stronger in the way.
But in a different angle, it really or ""accidentally"" created a story about how fear change things, how what we heard and what we know are very limited. As in the beginning, some group look like the bad guy who eventually that a little fear made many people suffer for decades. And how they have been disconnected from the world. Isn't this remind us some real life events?
Secondly, it is also about losing your close one. When Olaf was gone, there is minutes to metaphor about after people are gone, and how things left off turns into a weight on someone closed. And how it turns a person become different, remember how Anna was kind of aimed to sacrificed her life after Elsa and Olaf were dead? Like how losing someone we love so much, feels like a hole on our heart, and their wishes will become the only things we want to get done?And there's more. It made me laugh, but with tear inside. Hope children won't figure those out now, it's too much and too heavy for them.The story is weak on the surface, but a lot going under. We need to dive into and think.It's my honor to see your story, Queen Elsa and Queen Anna, in my country, there's a word as ""stories we created, is a message link to us from other galaxies."""
"The Animation- Nailed it
The Songs- Nailed it
The Plot- Maybe a bit scattering
But overall the movie is too good"
But this one is a little lower than Frozen (2013). The story sometimes not interesting as the first film.
"Usually with squeals, I'm skeptical, but I definitely thought Disney did a great job with this one. I laughed so hard at the Samantha line and the recap was perfect. When they play charades, it was also a cute moment. I liked that this movie had it's own story and had a cute moment of romance. I do feel sad for Elsa - that she doesn't have anyone but it's also nice to see a Disney film where a princess can have a great life and not have to fall in love."
"I was expected frozen 2 will not as good as the first one. But this movie is gorgeous from the first to finish.. funny, enchanting, touching deep enough..you should watch this."
It's ight for a Cinderella sequel I guess. My favorite part is when Anna says she wants to identify as a tic tac.
"This a very good sequel, if you compare it to other sequels of modern days. Defenitely better than many.Yet, it has this horrible feel of being commercial and secondary all over it. The storytelling is still good, yet the story itself degraded in complexity and power, and what we get is rather ""a predictable sequel story"" based on second-hand ideas, than a fairy-tale about princesses and sorcery. Lots of fuss, little of real character development. And commerciality, of course! So bold, that you can almost see big red 'ads' tag on top of some scenes, just like in 1990-s cheap cartoon series.Still, I rather liked it than not. And I think that you and your children will most probably like it, too."
"PLOT SPOILERS: Elsa is the fifth element who becomes a park ranger. They explore their past and save the enchanted forest. What I will say is this is great animation for bugged-eyed girls. I loved the opening flashback as Disney captures what we love about young girls. Elsa can hit and hold the high notes unlike Will Smith in Aladdin. Elsa hears Sirens in her ears, something I do too and my doctor says it is tinnitus ad I should watch my sodium. I thought the place of all is lost and all is found would be a metaphor for the mind, but Disney isn't deep like that in a kid's cartoon. There is an early song about change that hints at death and did I hear this line correctly? ""Peter Puppy just became fertilizer.""The girls will love it as the princess rides a magical horse and saves her kingdom. Anna gets engaged and Olaf gets pants."
"Everything I loved about Frozen was so much better in Frozen 2. The visuals and graphics were incredible, the music top notch, and all the feels were right where you needed them. As they brought in more heart, the story went deeper. I think the storyline went over some heads but I think parents can appreciate the characters as they truly evolve. Sometimes sad, sometimes funny it really is a great movie for all. 'Cause it wasn't just kids laughing in the theater..."
"Kids who have been following Frozen series will definitely like this movie, but for adults first half would be little too boring. Really enjoyed all the songs, in particular background theme music. Second half was very thrilling and we were at the edge of our seats!"
"Wow, fantastic! I have never seen such an interesting movie before. Elsa's dress is so beautiful! I can!"
It has very good story and songs.There are very funny and sad moments. It is better than the first one. So I'm giving 10/10.
"It was absolutely stunning, they knew their audience and made it deeper and more beautiful, the story was so fulfilling. The songs are amazing and it's all so intense. Definitely worth watching!"
"Frozen 22019
U
director: Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee
starring: Idina Menzel,Kristen Bell,Jonathan Groff,Josh Gad,Sterling K brown, Evan Rachel wood etcoverall rating 84/100Frozen 2 is based around a voice that Elsa ( Idina Menzel) can hear. So When it becomes to much for her to handle. She embarks on a journey with her sister Anna ( Kristen Bell), Christoff ( Jonathan Groff) and Olaf ( Josh Gad) as they embark on a journey to find the origins of Elsa's powers and secrets about there parents life's and with some fresh faces along the way. I was not expecting for frozen 2 to be as good as it was i rarely say a sequel is better then the first film but in this case i feel differently, lets talk about why this is.First of all the animation was fantastic. And the film was very funny. Wow the film looked absolutely stunning. They really paid loads of attention to the fine details within the film. Showing how far animation has come in 6 years. All the characters looked like real people. And the locations both new and old looked beautiful and really made for great world building. And secondly the films humour was fantastic and very clever. There was a lot of great slapstick gags and running gags throughout the film regarding some songs and Christoff's character. But the character that bought the most amount of humour for me would be Olaf. Josh Gad was fantastic and was given a very clever script to read off. Olaf was so random which was hilarious. And he always made light of awkward situations which is what the film needed. And he bought one of the best scenes of the movie when he reanacted the first film.My next positives would be the voice acting and for the most part the soundtrack. The voice acting from everyone was fantastic. All the characters had fantastic scripts and were delivered perfectly by the actors. And all there singing voices were fantastic as well. And the songs were for the most part very good. I didn't think any of the soundtrack would match the first film but i was mostly proven wrong. There was still some very funny and powerful songs here into the unknown being a fantastic lead single for the film. I do still have to say that the songs didn't quite match the standard of the first film with some weak links within the film compared to all the songs being good in the first film. This is just an observation and not really a criticism as i was expecting them to not be as good anyway.I do just have two more slight negatives. I thought that there was some dull plot points and a few of the characters were either over or underused. I thought that there was a few parts of the plot that were a bit dull and boring. Due to there being a lack of action throughout the first half and it being more focused on character development. So i wish the film was consistently entertaining throughout. But i understood there focus on the character development and the film very quickly got you invested again. And finally i thought that Olaf despite being funny was slightly overused and characters like Chrsitoff and some of the newer characters were underused. Yes Olaf was funny but i felt as if he overstayed his welcome slightly. And became irratating in places. So he could of been cut from a few scenes. And Christoff was underused. Yes he had some good humour with Anna and his song. But he was not in half of the film which was a shame. And new characters like Honeymaran (Rachel Mathews) were underused and only given a few scenes therefore making you not connect with there characters as much.My next two positives would be that i loved some of the new characters and i loved the films mystery. It was a good decision by the directors to spice it up and to add some new faces to the film and for me it really worked. Characters like Mattias ( Sterling K Brown) and Ryder ( Jason Ritter) bought some great new energy,emotion and humour to the film. And the films mysterious tone was fantastic. The fact that you didn't know what was going to happen or be revealed was really interesting to me. And kept me guessing and entertained throughout the movie.But my final big positive for the film would be its fantastic final act. They really went all out for the visuals and exploring Elsa's powers. And the mysterious tone continued throughout as well. Leaving you guessing who would survive. And the ending was very satisfying as well. Ending the film on a high note.Overall despite a few questionable character choices and the soundtrack not being quite on par with the first film. Frozen 2 offers a mysterious,thrilling and exciting new adventure. And is a rare improvement for a sequel which leaves me excited for its hopeful future."
The frozen 2 movie has done so outstanding well for a smash hit the box office charts and the songs are so outstanding that I am so members by it
"Many people know that Disney has made spinoffs of their popular movies only for the money, putting little to no effort into the actual ploy of the movie. If I'm honest, I was afraid frozen was going to be another one of those movies. However I was happy to find out I was wrong. Many people have complained that there is no great climax or battle scene at the end of the movie; while this may be a major turnoff for others I believe it suited the movie well. The graphics are amazing, but many have said this so feel no need to go into further detail. Frozen 2 is also a TON funnier than its predecessor. Especially Kristoffs 80's boyband song. My senior (high school) friends and I were cracking up the whole song. Anna and Kristoffs relationship does go to the next step when he proposes but the movie does a good job keeping that as a minor plot point, while still focusing on Anna and Elsa's relationship. The music is also INCREDIBLE (especially Elsa's songs); I almost liked it better than the first. Overall people are giving this movie too much of a hard time. Its a great family movie that everyone will enjoy!"
"Disney sure has been releasing sequels to their canon animated films lately. After the Wreck-It Ralph sequel 'Breaks the Internet' in 2018, Frozen II definitely ventures into the unknown with Anna, Elsa, Olaf, Kristoff, and Sven returning in the sequel to the 2013 phenomenal hit that is Frozen.Three years have passed since Elsa's Coronation and this time, the main characters must venture outside the Kingdom of Arendelle to investigate the mystery surrounding the two sisters' late parents and what it means to them and their kingdom.The voice talents of Idina Menzel and Kristen Bell reprising the roles of Elsa and Anna respectively makes their performances sound like they are very comfortable and accustomed to their characters that they fit like a glove. Likewise for Jonathan Groff and Josh Gad as Kristoff and Olaf. New characters like Mattias (voiced by Sterling K. Brown) and Iduna (voiced by Evan Rachel Wood) helped provide insight into the sisters' parents and personal struggles that they shed some light on the mystery pretty well.Songwriters Robert Lopez and wife Kristen Anderson-Lopez did yet another fantastic job with an assortment of great songs. The hype surrounding the musical number 'Into the Unknown' isn't quite as impactful as their Oscar-winning hit 'Let It Go,' but nevertheless worth a listen. I personally enjoyed Kristoff's ballad-like song and even Elsa's 'Show Yourself' (which I think is the TRUE show-stopping musical number that had me gesturing my hands as though I'm conducting an orchestra). The movie is also loaded with a few Easter eggs and times of meta references made for laughs, so that sure had me intrigued on how those played out courtesy of Olaf. It's something families with their kids will want to pay close attention to for fun.I admit the plot is ambitious with amazing visuals and adds more mature and dark themes than what the original film did in regards to the two sisters' family history, yet it still left me puzzled on some parts of why that is. There isn't a true villain in this movie as there was with past character Hans, only a misunderstanding that was forged out of fear and uncertainty among the new characters. The lukewarm narrative surrounding the fates of the main characters could've been something more than what was shown, but nevertheless, it had heart and I wasn't bored at all. There's also a moral to the importance of valuing family, no matter how troubled it may be. It's a must-see to kids and families willing to learn more about the mysteries surrounding Arendelle and the adventures these characters face beyond the familiar."
"Going into the movie I enjoyed the story, the development of the characters and the adventure though it felt slightly short it managed to captivate me. Than soon I realized that this movie is meant for the same kids who watched the 1st movie in 2013 who were between 3-7 at the time.So kids currently at the ages between 3-7 years might not relate/enjoy it, as it wasn't as musical as the 1st movie, neither the colors were as bright and lively this one had slightly a dim and gray color tone which is not what would capture this age of kids eyes.Overall Frozen II holds a more mature story and a deeper meaning to relationships such as the bond between the two sisters, the understanding nature of Christophe to Anna's new task and how embracing the past with its flaws and correcting them could lead to a better future"
"Our family was really looking forward to this sequel, but it failed to deliver. Plot was very thin-where's the villain? The songs were not memorable at all. My grandsons loved Olaf, thank God he was there to be his funny self. As with most sequels, not nearly as good as the first one."
"It has been six years since the release of Frozen, and since that release, the term ""overrated"" has been thrown around more and more. Personally, although I do think the music has been more than overplayed, I think the first film still stands on its own as a great animated feature film. Disney surprised me with that film in 2013 and even though I wasn't asking for a continuation, I was still very happy to watch it. Thankfully, even though it's obvious this movie got made to make the studio tons of cash, it also has some thought put into it, building off its predecessor the way a sequel should.With a call coming from an enchanted forest that Anna and Elsa were warned to never enter as kids, the two of them, along with the return of Kristoff, Sven, and Olaf, all bravely venture inside. Discovering that she may be able to find the origin of her powers, Elsa splits from the rest of the crew. This movie separates these characters for the majority of the run time, which I feel may have slightly hurt the movie. There is some nice closure that gives reason for why everyone needed to be separated, but it would've been nice to see them all have a little more screen time together.Aside from the song Let it Go, which will never be topped in terms of catchiness, I found that the soundtrack to Frozen II was far superior. The first film utilized the songs to tell the story most of the time, but also favoured them over the story at times. This film prioritizes them and works every song into the narrative in the way that I feel a proper musical should. Frozen II may not be an overall better movie than the first, but the musical aspect is very much an improvement.As always, the visuals are breathtaking and almost look realistic at times, the voice work is very impressive, and the messages throughout the movie are all great for kids, which is who this film is made for first and foremost. One of my complaints however, even though I still enjoyed his presence, was Olaf. Much like the use of Drax in Guardians of the Galaxy vol. 2, he is overused for comedic relief, far more than he was in the first film. I really enjoy his presence as I said, so it didn't ruin the film at all, it just felt like a bit much at times.In the end, with great music, a very solid story, visuals that would impress any viewer, and a worthy successor to that of the first film, Frozen II is worth your time. If you were a fan of the first film in any way, I think this movie will satisfy you if you have been eager to see this story continue. With that said, this really isn't a linear progression of the last film, but rather an evolution of it, which I appreciated. This is a solid sequel and I would gladly revisit it eventually, but I really don't see the need for another one. We'll see how much money this one makes I guess. Frozen II gets the seal of approval from me."
Movie hopped around quite alot ... Only truly cared for 1 song the song krisoff sang and the songs they repeated from last movie was nice to bring some hype into the movie... And Olaf helped make the movie entertaining but felt really blaunt for the rest. the storyline was adorable ... They could've made it a really good movie if they just kept that focus in one flow my son and I agreed we thought they would have found there parents alive that would've be a wonderful part .. my daughter fell asleep... Number one was way more better and exciting ...
"I like the overall stories: the songs, the magic, the conflicts, unexpected things, the adventures, etc. But the ending is quite disappointing. Frozen I ended with the sisters reuniting after a long separation, but Frozen II ended with them separating again, even further this time. (They could meet each other though, but still...)"
"Did anyone else see ""The Fifth Element"" with Bruce Willis and Milla Jovovich?
I liked Frozen II for sure, but thought it wasn't a coincidence in the similarities. Earth, Air, Fire, Water... One of the writers must be a fan of this movie!"
I thought this was a solid follow up. The theme of sisters is still there. The story is pretty good. The songs are good and 'Into the Unknown' sounds phenomenal in the cinema. Decent.
"My favorite line of the movie is ""You are the one, you have been waiting for, from Elsa's last song in the movie. I won't give away the context but it's beautiful and something that I think insecurity is something everyone struggles with. It's also something I think everyone has the ability to overcome. The question is, ""Do they want to?"""
"The conflict is about Elsa hearing a voice. Then she did call the spirit and made the Arendelle kingdom shut off. Elsa and Anna learned about their mother. All of the cast travel to the North to find the truth and solve the problem. It turns out that the dam is the cause. A unique twist was provided. King Ruinard, Elsa and Anna's grandpa, was actually a traitor.
Not really logical tho. But I enjoyed the music, the visual. It is truly outstanding. But, hope it can be real human next time."
"The animation is great. The story is also good. Anna and Elsa are good Elsa's new look is great. But still movie doesn't come close to frozen. The main low is music its no where near as the songs in frozen. And that lacking of a let it go song affect the movie.
The narration seemed rushed. The new charachters doesn't get much time nor does the past.
Frozen 2 is visually stunning and has got some great moments but lacks the magic the first one had."
"Best film for children, my child really loves it Suitable for family at weekend holiday"
"After so much anticipation and a lot to live up to following the original, it did not disappoint. Soundtrack is amazing!!!"
"The movie is really good, animation is stunning, storyline is also good though the ending felt rushed and should have been extended by couple of minutes, it also left some of the questions unanswered. Other than that there is no issue with this movie, not sure why people are giving so negative reviews. I watched it today to a full house and everyone in the end were clapping and were happy."
"The plot was very hard to follow sometimes. It feels like a cash grab, the story seems like it was written by middle schoolers. I leave it a 7 because I like frozen."
"Frozen 2 is so much better than the first in a lot of ways but one thing it kept feels like more of a detriment to this movie than the first. The pacing. Both films have such a break neck pace and in the first film I felt it left me kind of cold on the characters, but with such a simple plot it still worked.This movie has the same pacing but with added songs, character's, and amazing set pieces to take up the run time. This really leaves a similar impression as the first movie. What happens in the movie is satisfying and my god does it look (and sound) magnificent, but it dissapoints me a lot because I think an extra half an hour building the characters and world would make it feel so much more satisfying.I still think it's a nice movie. Id give it a 6.5/10 whereas I'd give the first a 6."
"It's everything the frozen universe has to offer but turned up a notch. You gain more back story on Elsa and Anna's past, brings back all the likable characters and adds a few new ones. There's definitely room for a frozen 3 in the future. I laughed, i felt the action sequences were spot on and I teared up all in 1 hour and 40 minutes. Also my 4 year old daughter loved it. It's a bit more mature then the first film but in the right ways. 9/10"
Step up from the first movie. Songs are less catchy than the previous ones but are more mature as is the movie as a whole. This movie is full of beautiful messages.
My friends the movie is really amazing and you should watch it to continue the storyline from frozen2. The songs are so good you'll feel them during you are listening. Thank you Disney
"Frozen 2 is honestly amazing!!This movie is nowhere near as childish as the first one, instead it replaces the girly childish aspect with an actual good emotional story. I'm almost 16 and this movie made me cry.So if your still thinking that maybe this film isn't for you because of the first film then your wrong as this film is a billion times better then Frozen 1!"
"Frozen II delivered on so many levels. The music was stand out, sure there was no Let It Go, but the music was catchy and done well. My boys loves it more than the first one and so did I. The story was rich, and folk lore was weaved into the original story. There was a mature feel to the this one and it was done in such a way that kids would still understand and feel for the characters."
"I give Frozen II mega points for creativity: They did not just re-hash the plot of the first movie, which you see far too often nowadays. It's actually super weird. No spoiler, but there is a lot of metaphysical stuff happening here. Perhaps too heady for kids, but... A) kids are dumb to begin with so what does it matter if *anything* goes over their heads (wink), and B) as an adult, I was digging it / really appreciating it. That said, the movie does fall short in a few areas where Frozen I truly excelled. Most notably, the music and songs are nowhere close to as memorable. They want ""Into the Unknown"" to be this generation's ""Let It Go"" and it's just not happening. There are a few winners in the batch, though. The first real rollicking number ""Some Things Never Change"" is a true keeper and probably the best written song in the film, a piano-led ensemble show tune that reminded me of early Billy Joel for some reason. And the Kristoff-sung power ballad ""Lost in the Woods"" is a true-to-form power ballad in every sense. It's out of place (especially the choice to present it as a music video in the middle of the movie), but not unwelcome (much like the ambitious story). Most everything else is kinda meh. Lastly, the pacing seemed to suffer from ambitious plotlines, but again: HUGE points for trying."
"1939, 69, 79, 99... There's something about years ending with -9, like punctual peaks of cinematic excellence before a decade fades. A coincidence maybe but so far, 2019 showed many directors at the top of their game like Tarantino or Scorsese to name. And Disney had just turned our ending year into something as spectacular and memorable as the climactic finale of the ""Let it go"" sequence. Yes, ""Frozen II"" is a sequel but it's classic Disney and I was surprised by how much I enjoyed it. I rarely make sounds in the theater but I did let many chuckles, belly laughs, ""oooow"" and ""woah"" slip during the film. That's what we call an experience.And to call it a sequel is extremely reducing, the film from the very start takes us to new discoveries, like the ""Harry Potter"" saga condensed in two hours (minus a quarter). No new hidden character popping out of nowhere, the discovery relies on an enchanted forest and the story of Elsa and Anna's parents and the film finds the perfect tone to make the expositional flashback not too forced, it does it through a heart-warming and poignant family scene: the father tells a story leaving a few blanks and the mother sings a lullaby that filled them with music and a hidden message.It's also a good moment because it gives more dimension to the parents and a few hints about the origins of Elsa's power. It starts with a mysterious peace treaty between Arendelle and the tribe of Northuldra that yet awakened the brutal forces of Nature, killing their grandfather, the previous king, knocking out the Prince (their father) and the identity of the little girl who saved him is easily guessable. The sequence echoes the first film's opening with Elsa and Anna playing with snow and little Anna's comments prevent it from being too sappy.And so the film takes us back to Arendelle the kingdom, its people, Kristoff, Sven, and Olaf. I thought Olaf was a comic relief but in that opus, we need relief from the laughs he provides. I lost track at the number of gags and his tender goofiness is irresistible (though there's a sort of Charmander lookalike who's too cute for words). So we see Olaf playing mime games with Kristoff and Sven as teammates and the fun is interrupted when Elsa starts hearing a mysterious melody, a sound I kept humming when I left the theater. It's perhaps the 2019 version of the ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" tune, culminating with the ""Into the Unknown"" song.To be fair, a ""Let it Go"" it ain't but that doesn't say much because there are a lot of great songs in the film and while I enjoyed the one near the climax, my favorite is the one that offers Kristoff his shining moment, a hilarious parody of these cheesy boys' band ballads from the 90s, both Kristoff and Sven were hilarious and I suspect adults laughed a little more than kids. And it says a lot about the writers, smart enough not to take music for granted and some situations not too seriously. There's even a moment where Elsa encounters her icy counterpart shouting ""Let it go"" and she shudders, even in that universe, the song becomes a massive annoyance.Speaking of ""Let it Go"", it became a mantra to female empowerment, generating a new breed of heroines and that's how I summed it up in my review of the first film, saying that it ""knew how to be significant"". My main concern wasn't exactly that the film was subverting tropes about Charming Princes dreaming princesses but that it was so focused on the major twist at the end that it had a rather weak middle-act and a weak villain. The merit of ""Frozen II"" is that it's got all the characters it needs already established, with their strengths and personalities and from that solid starting point, the writers move on with an inventive plot in a terrific setting.I'll finish by saying that ""Frozen"" has always had a place in my heart although I rated it 'sven': the film was released at my daughter's birth year, she knew the 'Let it Go"" song at 3, she dressed as Elsa in the school fete the same year, I made a video for her 4th birthday with the ""Let it Go"" theme, and I saw the film so many times, it became a part of my life. I confess I was alone at the theater but watching the film took me back to a not so distant past. And I loved it because it was sweet, moving, it had self-referential comedy and nothing to get too over-analytical about (some will find questionable that one officer doesn't exactly look like a Scandinavian but let it go).The film also had a magnificent imagery. I could comment on the spectacular ""facing-the-wave"" moment that could work as a metaphor for encouraging people to face the so-called barriers that undermine their rise, but I was impressed by more modest stuff, like how realistic the animation looked at smaller moments: the sisters' gasp when they see their parents last stand, Anna's perplexed look when Kristoff's attempt to ask her for marriage fails miserably, and even the way Anna sneezed when she was crying... the reason I mention is this is because I believe the purpose of animation is to look as close to reality but by still having that edgy look over realism.In an era overloaded by live-animation version of Disney classics, even CGI feels like traditional animation, even the story is pure fairy tale material, it even ends with a marriage and maybe, maybe that's what this little voice thing is about and Disney studios should listen to it and get back to their roots. Finding answers in the past to build the future, maybe ""Frozen II"" is a metaphor for what Disney movies should seek."
"This film has absolutely spectacular animation !
MUST WATCH IT ONLY IN IMAX 3D for a truly wonderful, memorable experience.However, this film was made to cash-in on the success of the original - as the plot is just a formality, with no logic.There are too many songs to make up for a lack of plot and every single song is really bad ( but beautifully animated ;)"
"I have given 10/10 for this movie. Story lone is amazing and everything else was just flawless. All of the story, scene, characters and everything else just fit in so well. I was very happy and thankful that I saw this amazing creation on big screen. Sisters bonding and family values were displayed positively. Just want to thank the team!!! Good job"
"Spoilers!!!
This movie really picks up where the first 'Frozen' ended. It's visually stunning, the story is GREAT!
I gave an 8 because of the cringy Kristoff song (seriously, what's up with that!?!?) and the sometimes over-the-topp Olaf. Otherwise I also want to say that I understand some critic reviews where they said children didn't love it as much, the story isn't exactly fit for 4 year olds, I think it might be too complicated and some of the dialogue might be to hard for small children. But 24 year old me had a blast, it's a perfect sequel, lovely movie and in some ways better than the first one!"
"This film, is a shockingly exceptional experience. They've done orders of magnitude greater of a job than the original Frozen which I would rate for 12/10 back in time.
In an objective stand point, this movie is a library for all ages that is so discrete, you are guaranteed to find something awesome in there that is built for you! For kids, you get to know terrible things happen in life (not the point, but if you say this film is dark), there is a lullaby and many funny moments to please you. For the adults, there are your jokes, a song ""Lost in the Woods"", symbolism like the 4 elements (which are exactly the ones in Aristotle's theory back in 450 BC), there is also hints for an entire topic of world-wide aboriginal crisis in the Colonial Era(for those who are willing to learn from the past without a bias), there is all kinds of moments that you realize ""Do I just not know enough"", and this is also a heavy story on its own full of philosophical hints. Or you are just into the hype of ""Into the Unknown"" and want to spend time with friends or family, you may find ""Show Yourself"" more extraordinary after all.And for someone like me who is 19-year of age, this franchise is especially meant for our generation. I see my path of growing up in the characteristics of Olaf, most of his reactions are resonance of my childhood. I also didn't like the soundtrack at the start, but it only made me more of a fan after a few moments of struggle, which I would call the magic of Frozen. For now, this film is stuck in my heads after a few times of rewatching, and I can literally recall a scene in the movie to describe my mood at any given time.Although there are still moments that contradicts science (especially violation of some fundamental laws of Physics from what stuck in my head) and logic while they put in quite a number of the latest scientific facts into a supposedly 1840s background, I guess it all make sense spiritually just like we look at how ridiculous Aristotle's 4-element today compare to The 4 Fundamental Forces of modern science.And after all, remember it is those weaknesses that you once dislike strengthen the love, just like how good relationship doesn't feel ""good"" right off the start!"
"This movie is absolutely one of the best I've ever seen...even though their r some unanswered questions but the animation, characters, climax & the story as a whole is just amazing.I loved it!"
"Frozen 1 was great, but frozen 2 was better in some ways. The animation was amazing and spot on. the songs were great and catchy! Many have said the plot was anti climatic, but it really wasn't. I just for once didn't expect a fairytale ending, but I was wrong and frozen 2 delivered exactly that. the only reason this is a nine Is because Frozen 2 ended out perfectly and supplies that in your life everything is sunshine and rainbows but the ending is good."
I think the poor reviews and reason behind them is totally unjust i went with my 3 children they absolutely loved every minute as its really for children hence adults become wannabe movie critic's but its not intended for adults so the story needs to be such as children can follow that said i also thoroughly enjoyed it myself a must wach a 10 out of 10
"Compared to the sequels and spin offs, this is the definitive movie out of the bunch. Elsa's character has been developed tenfold and the movie was better from the movie stand point. People think this music is mediocre because apparently 'it doesn't have a showstopping song like let it go' but I disagree. Yes the music is not the best but the soundtrack has a better average rating compared to the original. I have to emit that the supporting characters were not as strong as they were in the original. But the story isn't about them. The trolls were awful characters in the original and this movie made fun of them and the twist villain. Anna however did improve. She wasn't the main focus this time around but when she was she had a vital role. Also why do people call this a commercial? Commercial movies are just movies that cram in as many merchandisable characters as possible. This only added the northuldrans and the forest spirits. Overall this movie is leagues above the rest and there wasn't a twist villain this time. 9/10 Would watch again multiple times."
"I'm not sure why half the bad reviews say the story is too predictable and the other half say it doesn't make sense! Which is it?
This is definitely a Disney musical, so don't be surprised that it has plenty of musical numbers and funny moment. Sure, this movie doesn't have an instant classic like ""Let It Go"", but the music is just as amazing, and I would argue the story is much improved over the last one. The characters show real growth, without regressing to the same old struggles like some sequels.
Don't let the reviews get you down, see it for yourself! Definitely has a lot to love, if you leave preconceived notions at the door."
Elsa is just gorgeous and talented. Storyline isn't that well organized but the animation and scenes are so good.
"The animators at Disney/Pixar deserve much higher billing. This is one of the most visually stunning animated movies out there without resorting to gimmicks such as first person 3D drops and slides.
However the story is a little thin and confusing leaving the audience with more questions than answers and an uncertain path for sequels (though Disney will undoubtedly try to keep the cash cow going). A sub plot involving Kristoff is unnecessary though the feature of a Micheal Bolton style power ballad harkened back to the Disney of the 90s. Mercifully Olaf continues to provide his go-to comedic relief and single moment of insight to motivate one of the main characters.Would recommend watching but don't expect a repeat of the original."
As a big fan of the first Frozen film I went into the sequel with high expectations and i'm pleased to say that my expectations were met. I was very happy with the majority of the songs especially 'Some Things Never Change' however I do marginally prefer the songs from the original especially 'Let it Go' which outperforms its Frozen 2 counterpart 'Into the Unknown'. The story is definitely bigger this time around and has a much clearer plot with plenty of comical moments that are perfectly balanced with more intense scenes. I believe that hardcore Frozen fans will be happy with the character development and relationships throughout especially that of Elsa and Anna which is now fully established and is both believable and heart warming. In terms of the animation Frozen 2 is practically perfect and the heavier reliance on magic allows for several breathtaking scenes. I also loved the call backs to the first film and personally had no problem with the ending unlike many reviews I have seen.My only small negative would be that the plot was somewhat predictable but that is a common theme among modern day animated Disney films. Overall I was very pleased and would rate Frozen 2 - 9 out of 10.
"I found the story to be quite engaging all throughout the movie, and the end in my opinion is fairly great. All the voice actors do amazing, especially Adel Dazeem as Elsa, who has an incredible singing voice.
I adore the first movie, and I still think that one is better, but this sequel doesn't disappoint either, and the animation by the way is just impeccable, as you would expect from a movie of this magnitude."
I never would have though the day would come for the sequel of a beloved movie. Its been too long for a sequel. And yet it worth every snow drops. The sequel truly surpass its predecessor although the first has more memorable songs then this which only for me about 4 to 5 songs that I like. Truly recommended for family and your loves ones to enjoy!
"Frozen II is better than the first. It may go a little over younger kids' heads, but I am glad Disney shot for the stars and went for more. I thought Frozen I was cute, but that's all it was. This new film holds your attention and keeps you in throughout. I applaud Disney for coming up with a truly original story.Kudos also for the music which I thought was a lot more engaging than the first movies' tunes. My favorite is Show Yourself. I believe it is the truest answer to Let It Go.The animation was also fantastic, some truly jaw-dropping moments there. The realism has improved.2 stars off for feeling a bit rushed towards the end. I wanted to cry but some crucial scenes were blown through very quickly. The climax tries but it cannot hold a candle up to DreamWorks' How to Train Your Dragon's franchise closeout, The Hidden World. A truly gut-reaching, bittersweet ending. Perhaps Disney wanted to play it safe and not ruin it for the kiddies. Ah, what could have been....Altogether Frozen II is an engaging sequel, one that I believe could fully stand in its own right."
"Frozen II is directed by Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee, screenplay by Jennifer Lee, and story by Jennifer Lee, Chris Buck, Marc Smith, Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez.
Starring Kristen Bell, Idina Menzel and Josh Gad.Frozen II is about Anna, Elsa, Kristoff, Olaf and Sven who leave Arendelle to travel to an ancient, autumn-bound forest of an enchanted land. They set out to find the origin of Elsa's powers in order to save their kingdom.Frozen was amazing, I think it's one of the best movie of 2013, it was beautifully animated, deep, emotional, showstopping and amazingly voiced! Frozen II was one of my top 5 anticipating movies, and it definitely delivers, Frozen II -once again- is one of the most memorable and special movies of 2019, I think it's one of the best movies of this year!Though the plot of this movie is simple, you will find yourself getting something every scene, there was so much happening, and that's something great, to have a simple plot, and to know how to extract entertaining from it without making the audiences feel that the plot is huge, but it fact it was simple.. and that's amazing!Also the movie has no villain, and that's weird for Disney, and this genre in general, but still the movie was amazing without one, it handled itself very well without a villain to make them do stuff as it happened in How to Train Your Dragon 3, but no, Frozen II survived without a villain, and that made the story compelling, that it's different, it took risks, and also interesting, because what made the journey so good and special is that they went for it not because someone was threatening them, they went for it because they had to but for other motivations, other than a villain, and that what made Frozen II compelling and interesting.When it comes to improvements over the first one, of course the first thing that will pop up in everyone's mind is the animation, and yeah, Frozen II is appealing to the eyes, it's gorgeous to look at, and the details are so impressive, there are lots of scenes in the water and it didn't feel animated, for the most part the water seemed real, just like how amazing the animation was in Toy Story 4.The plot is more richer, there is more that's happening, the first one was simple, and the sequel is -as some are saying- the more complex. For me they're both amazingly simple, it's just that the execution in the second one, made it darker and more complex.Elsa's development made her really good in this movie, and way more interesting than the first one, and there's another transformation scene, which also has some details to notice, that really was chilling and gave her character a deeper and emotional feeling!Also Olaf is really funny in this movie, he's more often in this movie more that the previous one, but I would say that I liked his character as much as I liked him in the first one, which is a lot! But what made him improved that we got more of him in this movie than what we got in the first one.When it comes to deterioration I think this movie is not as good as the first movie as a musical, I think the first one has better songs, this one is still great don't get me wrong, but the first one was better in that aspect.Kristoff's character isn't that good in this movie, all he was doing in this movie is that he wanted to marry Anna and he was trying to propose to her and that's it! He's my least favorite part of this movie. He's not that bad, he still has a couple of gags throughout this movie, but he's not as good as he was in the first one, he's so cliched in this movie, even more than the first one, that's why I didn't like him that much in this movie.When it comes to flaws, I think this movie isn't as good as the first one, besides the things I said above, I think that the movie was a little rushed, some actions and decisions were made really fast without that much of thinking or discussions, and that's my main issue with this film.. and that's all about it!To me, what makes this movie really works is the sister-ship between Anna and Elsa, it got deeper in this movie, and every scene they were together the movie got better, I think they're what made this movie beautiful, and their bond what got into my heart and eyes into tears! Also the ending is so beautiful, I don't wanna spoil anything, but the ending is just one of the best ending in 2019!The movie also can be funnier that the first one from time to time, there's that much of rude humor, but adults can find themselves laughing more than kids, because some scenes were shot in a way that adults can find more funny, but kids won't get it, and that's a good thing, because animated movie nowadays only rely on rude humor to make adults laugh, but Frozen II is gonna be a weapon to defend yourself when you say that rude humor isn't the only way to make adults laugh in animation.Frozen II is awesome from start to finish, it was never dull, it never dragged down.. it used everything as it could to make this movie as fun as it it, it's so magical to go through this journey with this amazing cast into the unknown!
Yeah, right this movie has a song that's gonna stuck with you for years, goodluck trying to get it out of your head!I'm gonna give Frozen II an A-, I think it's one of the best movie of 2019, look forward to my spoiler review of Frozen II because there're so many stuff that I loved about this movie, that made it special, but I couldn't talk about them, because you know.. spoilers are bad!Alright guys, than you as always for reading my review, and if you like this you can click on my name to see some more."
"So my niece adores the 1st Frozen, but she loved this one more. Great visuals and a great story... maybe the songs aren't quite as iconic, but the story was better"
"What a beautiful, engaging, entertaining flick. I felt like I spent almost two hours getting an eye massage. The water and mountain textures are unbelievable. I loved it, thanks Disney!"
"I just watched it at the cinema and it was so amazing. I had been waiting so long for it and it was worthy the wait. Great graphics, nice storyline, carismatic characters, heart touching music, lively colours. Much better than the first movie. I'd watch it again and again."
This movie was amazing. I just watched it and i cried most of the movie. Its a very touching movie and i think this movie deserves a reward. I very much liked elsas new dresses and how kristoff did something amazing at the end
"This was visually stunning, the music is amazing (my family hasn't stopped listening to the soundtrack since we left the theatre yesterday), we were all in tears during the film. It is breathtaking and an emotional roller coaster. I love that Kristof had more singing this time around. The song Show Yourself gives me chills!!! My husband wants to go see it again, but with no kids this time. I think this is better than the first movie. I will be buying it as soon as it releases."
"Better than I expected and well worth the wait. As disappointed as we were that Elsa didn't get a girlfriend, it's not like they wasted the screen time on filler. There just wasn't room in this film for an Elsa romance. Frozen 3 should be it."
"Frozen 2 builds up more emotions from the original Frozen, answering the questions left in the first one. The sequel focuses even more on seeking your inner self (Elsa), to walk your own path of life besides following others footsteps (Anna), to step out your comfort zone, and to embrace loneliness in life. They do take more time to understand it since the meaning in the sequel is a much deeper to find. For a person who often questions myself, asking whether this is the life I've been looking for, the movie really gets me. It gives me confidence and encourages me to face the difficulties in life. Seeing my favorite movie return with the same energy, makes me love the story even more, it will always have a place in my heart.Visual effects: If you think the first one's visual was beautiful, the sequel will definitely blow your mind, Frozen 2 has improved so much six year later. The details of the water and ice is flawless, it looks so real to believe that it's not. The outfit design is still astonishing. Also the changing details of facial expressions in the characters are really impressive, so I believe those who like the animations in the first will love Frozen 2 even more.Music: It needs more time to understand, and it's good. The songs weren't as catchy as ""Let it go"", but after awhile the feelings actually grow inside me and it builds up the emotion even more comparing to the songs in Frozen. Idina's ""Into the Unknown"" and ""Show Yourself"" are definitely great songs. Kristen Bell is still talented, "" The Right Thing"" is a big change for Anna, she can no longer be princess she used to be, she realized her new purpose. Evan Rachel Wood's ""All is found"" is so underrated, it's an amazing lullaby song that was connected to other songs(and the entire story).Story: The plot is definitely not bad, it's just there was so much potential in the story development and Disney chose the easier one, the story was not deep enough for certain audiences. Don't get me wrong, I still love the movie, but I honestly wish they could have added more twist in the story . What happened was they wanted to discuss multiple subjects all in the same time(colonialism, environmental problems, racial diversity, etc.), and it didn't executed as perfect as expected. But you know what they say, the higher expectations, the bigger disappointment. Besides, younger generations and merchandising were obviously huge considerations for movies like Frozen ( it's Disney com'on ), they wanted to keep it as a family movie that audiences from all ages can enjoy, and I understand that. I really hope both Disney and some audiences can let go a bit.Characters: What makes the movie special is the main casts. The four of them show great chemistry whenever they're together in real life. During interviews, all of them know their characters and the movie so well, because they really love the movie. I love how Kristen Bell is so true to character, she literally has the same personality Anna does. Kristen IS the real Anna.
The two sisters remain to be best part of the movie, we get know more about their mother Iduna's past and the truth about the kingdom's history. Olaf is still kinda annoying to some people(but kids love him anyway). The salamander is so adorable it catches audiences' eyes. It's a pity that other characters, especially Kristoff(he only had one purpose in story) didn't do much in the sequel, but hey at least he got that hilarious 80s style song-joke, parents would enjoy it."
It is an amazing Disney movie! The story and the development of the characters are impressive.. Elsa's new songs are amazing and the end of the movie is super emotional! It is a film full of positives messages for kids! Love it
"Saw the first one, 13 times at the cinema! Today I saw this for the 2nd time ... in IMAX. I really like it! Well I won't see it 13 times ... Not that crazy anymore lol Maybe 3-4 more times. LoL Loved the ""Let it go"" moment :D Not spoiling anything LoL No words just go and see it for yourself ... p.s. I'm old af and love animated movies!"
"The wife and I had the day off (Day after Thanksgiving) so we decided to take our 3 kids and a family friend to see Frozen II. We all loved it!!! Such a great story and absolutely GORGEOUS animation!, The story does seem kinda rused at time but it isnt bad. If you loved Frozen you will love part 2."
"The story of this movie is great and really luv it.....especially Olaf...ooooh he is very funny and wonderful.....luv the story, the character, really amazing........"
"Disney delivers a much more mature and grounded film for its sequel to Frozen. To my surprise, the film is not just a nostalgia cash grab, they actually had an interesting brand new setting, set of characters, and story to explore.
The beginning of the film was a little bit slow and lacked a good theme, which worried me at first. Elsa didn't really have a good reason to go into the forest other than feeling (through her powers) that the forest had some good in it, but since the audience doesn't exactly know how her powers work since it wasn't ever explored, we are just forced to accept this fact without knowing why. The whole subplot of Christoff trying to purpose to Anna was quite forced and uninteresting. It was the only justification as to why Christoff and Sven were even in the movie, but I feel if they had just cut them from the movie and focused more on Anna and Elsa, it would have been a lot more powerful.
Once they found their parents' crashed ship, the film got so much better! This film at its core is about how to deal with change. It can be hard at times and we may not understand everything, but we need to choose to not give up and to do the right thing.
As someone who thought that the previous Frozen soundtrack was filled with songs that were either forgettable or alright, I am absolutely blown away by how great the soundtrack is in this film! ""Into the Unknown"" is miles better than ""Let it Go"", as well as ""Show Yourself"". However ""The Next Right Thing"" is among one of the greatest Disney songs in my opinion! It is so dark and uncomfortably candid for a film targeted at kids. The song works in the context of the story, however could also work in much more dark and real contexts. ""When I Am Older"" and ""Lost in the Woods"" are okay, but are definitely the slacking songs of the soundtrack.
The climax of the film was intense and exciting like a fantasy adventure, but a little bit convenient and rushed when it comes to the aftermath of Arendelle. Even the fire scene in the middle of the film was exciting which was surprising considering there weren't much exciting action scenes in the original Frozen.
Overall, I have a lot of small problems with this film that don't seem to tip me over too much, and with the original, I have a few big problems that ruined what could have been one of Disney's greatest films. Frozen II is better than the original in its ambition, story, music, themes, and grittiness."
"Let's be honest - this film was birthed as a cash grab. Despite this, its clear that the entire team behind Frozen 2 is doing their best to justify the movie's existence by expanding and layering the original story. And for the most part, they are successful.Thematically, the film matures with its original target audience (now pushing age 10-11) by addressing issues such as inclusion, self-change, societal myths on who is bad versus good etc. and will potentially open doors for some interesting conversations between kids and parents. The film's willingness to lean into some of these more mature themes makes the film work. Other reviews have made comments about the overly simplistic plot, and it is a fair critique, but at no point does it drag the story into cringe-worthy moments or boredom; in fact, it seems to balance the film well and make its potential scope bigger for keeping much younger viewers engaged who may not pick up on some of the questions characters are asking themselves and each other. Older audience members will not be taken by surprise by twists or plot revelations, but it in no way makes the film a failure.For what Frozen 2 lacks in a ground-breaking story, it offers plenty in visuals, score, and solid performances by the entire cast. Josh Gad absolutely steals entire scenes as Olaf and makes a character that could easily cross the line into eye-roll-inducing-sidekick into a much needed comedic reprise from the heavier moments and darker scenes that could be overwhelming for sensitive movie-goers under the age of eight. Kristen Bell and Idina Menzel also bring worthy performances to the table and seem to be having just as much fun in this sequel as they did in the first Frozen.Frozen 2 hovers around its predecessor in quality from start to finish and is a worthy part two for Anna, Elsa, Kristoff, and Olaf - regardless of why it exists."
I actually liked the second movie better than the first. The characters had major development and I love how there was no clear villain. Adults will love this more than children
"The trouble with these big sequels is that the box office return is the main objective and story takes a backseat. I will say this story was decent though. It's a top-shelf, big budget film, and for the most part they get it right. As in the first Frozen, I found a few scenes and choice of words unnecessary considering any kids 3 and up will most likely be watching. I'm not being a prude, just wish such a big influence would be more conscious throughout the entire film. The music was great, the animation is obviously stunning. If you and/or your kids loved the first one, you'll enjoy this one as well. Best served with copious amounts of popcorn!"
"Don't come with high expectations, I came to the cinema expecting a fine movie, and came out feeling good. Not as good as the first, but you can't say it wasn't worth the long wait for the movie. Don't come with high expectations, I came to the cinema expecting a fine movie, and came out feeling good. Not as good as the first, but you can't say it wasn't worth the long wait for the movie."
"Frozen 2013 has it own beauty, so does Frozen 2. I even cannot compare it into which one is better. As the value of the first movie was it is okay to have a fear. By the end, that we still have people arround us who believe in us, then, it has to be a reason to have courage. But, in the second movie, I see it more complex and mature where after you get the courage to show your self, you are tested by comfort zone. Do you still doing this even it's already satisfy your happiness? Or, you could have another big responsibilities ahead to go out of your comfort zone? Why do we have to? It's because life keeps you moving. So, a movie like this, a lesson learned for a family, should be overrated. Moreover, some plots are unpredictable which is great for an animation movie. So-so story line is boring. So, this ""into the unknown"" movie still becoming the hit. Also, I like the way Olaf tell a story which he is better than me and the way Kristoff sing a 80-song ballad, never disappoint me. The soundtrack? Always stunning. So, what is the matter of this movie? Nothing. It's worth your eyes and bucks."
"ITS BEAUTIFUL. GO TO THE NEAREST THEATRE AND WATCH IT. YOU'LL NOT REGRET IT.The film is not boring. It is better than Frozen. A lot of twist, its funny, and the soundtrack is just.. its beautiful."
"Only a word appeared in my head when I was watching Frozen II, this is GORGEOUS."
"I suppose a lot of people are writing reviews taking the point of view of a child. Yes, there are scenes that are a little stronger and have much more depth to it (loss, death, sarcasm, etc) but that's exactly what gives the franchise the extra energy it needs to survive one more episode. The whole magic visual effects are stunning, and there are a LOT of them. I really enjoyed the more mature tone of the movie. The songs are pretty amazing too. For me, this is a 10/10."
"The Animation-Nailed it
The Songs-Nailed it
The Plot-Maybe a bit scattering
But overall the movie is too good"
"The animation was breath taking, the sequel was very funny. The story was more complex but I'd consider saying this movie is even better than Frozen I"

"My fascination with the Frozen story continues from the first film. As soon as this movie came into view, I watched it right away. And I liked it a lot. If you love animated films, you should definitely watch them."
"Really worthy to watch after waiting for 6 years, i'm crying because of happiness! 😭💓"
"Frozen II Review:Frozen II is the sequel to the 2013 movie that surprised audiences everywhere. This time we find Elsa, Anna, Kristoff, Sven, and Olaf traveling in an autumn forest to a village of people who may have the answers to Elsa's origin with her powers. Frozen became a huge hit when it first came out and everyone loved it. I did like it until it became very annoying and the songs were everywhere. I still do like it, it's just that I can only handle so much of it. The same thing worried me for this one. Obviously the sequel wouldn't be as great as the first, but I didn't want to be annoyed if I actually really liked it. Frozen II reminds me a lot of last year's Ralph Breaks the Internet: not necessary and not as great as the first, but entertaining. Many people will disagree with the comparison I made, in fact I know many who just adored it. I thought it was fine. Personally, I have problems with stories that return to the original so we learn something we didn't know before, if that makes any sense. In this case we go back to their childhood right away and learn about this forest. That's just something I don't really like, however there's not much I can do about that. The story itself wasn't bad, definitely not as strong as the first. I didn't feel as strongly connected with the characters to begin with. The circumstances towards the end helped me become more invested with the characters. There's a risk taken that results in a darker tone and I thought that was a great opportunity for some character development and emotion. Anna and Elsa were by far the strongest characters, Anna more than Elsa. Elsa is just trying to figure things out kind of on her own which was good for her, but there was a detachment with the characters then which I wasn't a huge fan of. Kristoff almost felt different from the first movie. He's trying to propose to Anna all this time, but it's never working out. He sings this song, and it's not a bad song, it's just that it felt out of place when it happens. However that scene was entertaining. Speaking of entertaining, Olaf is a character that's supposed to entertain everyone with his stupidity. I can only handle so much of him. I find that character to be very annoying. Mainly, my problem was with the characters and some of the choices they made throughout the story. The singing is good once again. I didn't find the songs to be that catchy and fun, but in a couple weeks they'll be stuck in my head I'm sure. One of them, either All is Found or Into the Unknown, will most likely make it into the Best Original Song category. My favorite song, other than Lost in the Woods, was The Next Right Thing because that song showed some emotion. Once again I really liked that darker tone towards the end. The animation gets better and better each and every movie. I loved looking at the screen to see the beautiful scenery. For those who don't know, I love autumn so the parts in the autumn forest were just so beautiful to look at and I didn't want to look away at the scenery. Overall I think Frozen II is a fine movie, but nothing special for me. I just wanted a more from the story and characters. Since it's a movie primarily aimed towards children, it became predictable. Most everyone will enjoy this movie and I would recommend seeing it.My Grade: B-"
I loved this movie. I was not expecting much but Disney won me over. The story was pretty good but what really store the show were the amazing songs and the attention to detail in the animation. Would recommend!
"Everything actually makes sense, and there is more humour and depth to the story than you might notice the first time you see it, because you have to pay close attention: one line of dialogue or second of animation missed and you'll miss it.
It helps to have seen the first Frozen as well. Granted, I was at the end of a 36 hour day, but this movie benefited massively from my second viewing, when I was fully awake. Pay attention towards the end, in particular.All is Found > Into the Unknown."
". . . to enjoy FROZEN II as a mildly diverting fairy tale without thinking very much, but anyone more mature than that must not ignore this film's strident Progressive Call to Action. Even more pointedly than JOKER's ""Kill the Rich"" Climax, FROZEN II exposes the fraudulent, back-stabbing anti-social nature of Corrupt Communist Corporate Capitalism. Eager to throw up environment-destroying dams to turn a quick buck by hastening Global Warming, sisters Elsa and Anna's Evil Grandpa King is righteously slaughtered for his perfidy as this cautionary tale opens. However, the sordid carnage unleashed by this duplicitous miscreant's nefarious scheming lives on to plague several subsequent generations. The main takeaway from FROZEN II is that ALL the dam dams MUST go, along with any ""factory"" with a footprint larger than 2,000 square feet. ALL corporations MUST be outlawed, before their killer bots and algorithms are allowed to maximize corporate profits by erasing people from the face of the Earth. As with the TERMINATOR series, our FROZEN franchise exhorts us to act immediately: It's THEM or US!"
"The problem in Frozen 2 is more from outside of its characters. 2 is more likely to tackle environmental things rather than personal feeling things. And in 2, it lack of bad evil person. Most people loves antagonistic evil character that will make protagonist life harder. So less dramatic point for some.For me, 2 is better than 1 because it's like a journey of finding your true self and know how beautiful & important of nature's are. I really enjoy their step by step of adventures in the beautiful nature's animation. The humor are on spot too. Overall I love this one better then its predecessor. The only things better in the previous Frozen 1: soundtrack."
A lot of times disney sequels aren't as good as the first one or aren't good at all. Frozen 2 is so beautifully animated and it is so magical. The characters are just as great as the first one and the songs are good but in my opinion not as good as the first one. This story is much deeper and darker in ways and is very emotional. I really enjoyed it!!!!
I like the music more in this one and laughed much more. BUT it would be so much better if this film was made in classic 2d handdrawn animation.. Well but this is possibly something you can say to every newer disney film which is in this gross new 3d cgi bla bla .. but besides that i really enjoyed this film and can recommend to watch it in a cinema
This movie is one of the most beautiful and meaningful animations that I've ever watched. So many beautiful life lessons that I am amazed by the way they could picture them all. Beautifuuuuuullll
"I cant see the connection between scenes in this film, but the story isn't too bad. The visuals are spectacular, as so the music. But the savior of this film is elsa's beauty she is soooo beautiful."
"Me and my young daughter watched this film! Was magical and animation out of this world, this movie is Elsa where the first movie was more Anna even though Elsa discovered her powers , I really enjoyed frozen 1 but this had more quicker pace and songs wonderful will go and watch it again"
"There is so much to be said, but really you should do yourselves a favour and just go see it with an open mind. I was a fan of Frozen 1, but felt it had a fair number of issues, chief among them being the use of the trolls and the troll song.Frozen 2 is a movie written not so much for a new generation of children, but for the now older fans of the first film, somewhat like what J.K. Rowling did with the Harry Potter books.The tone is definitely darker than the first film, and leans hard into the mystical elements that were present but not emphasized in the first. The dark elements give the characters room to grow as they overcome challenges, and every character (save perhaps for Sven) is a more complicated version of their first film selves. If you want a re-do of the first one, or just a funny comedy movie, this may not be for you. There are comedic moments throughout, but they offer relief from the underlying drama instead of serving as the focal point.Thematically, the film has a lot to say. Yes, it is still about family, love and friendship, but it is also about our relationship with the earth and with First Peoples. How history is often not what it seems. How we should still try to do what is right even if the path is not clear. Perhaps these are not new themes. Maybe the plot isn't completely unexpected and full of twists and turns. But the journey itself is so richly realized that it doesn't matter to me. These are valuable messages that feel pretty powerful in 2019, and I did not feel that the film was overly heavy-handed in the delivery.The animation and visuals are stunning. The songs perhaps do not immediately catch you the way Let it Go did in the first one, but they are hauntingly beautiful. I have kept listening to them since I saw the film, and they get better and better.Overall I feel that this is a very emotional, mature and well-paced film. I honestly think this went right over the heads of a lot of viewers based on the reviews I have seen out there. I went in hopeful but was blown away."
"I walk into the theater expecting to be entertained with new catchy songs, stunning visual effects, just like it's successful prequel and wasnt let down since the movie kept on doing such an amazing job in the musical aspect of the franchise, mostly thanks to the very talented voice actors that all returned for their roles and also the new blood. However, when it comes to storytelling, although the movie was able to set up so many potential plots and lessons during it's early minutes, but since it failed to show the character's motivations and consequences of their decisions, the massages delivered to us at the end of the movie seem to be not persuasive and quite confusing at first, at least they were to me. Overall, still a very quality disney's product that should be enjoyed by both adults and the younger audiences."
"The animation in Frozen 2 is top notch, vivid colors and light work, interesting character models, etcHowever the movie telegraphs early on and where Frozen 1 surprised, the sequel fell flat.the music: there are no ""let it go"" ear worms despite them trying to make ""into the unknown"" happen. It's not bad, but it's not classic.The plot: It's curious to me what the conversation in the writers room was when developing the plot. Either they genuinely didn't know they were remaking Fifth Element, or they didn't care because they say ""spirit"" instead of element.Conclusion: my kids were entertained; there are some genuinely funny parts, but there are a couple of ""remember last time"" jokes that seemed like they wouldn't have happened if the sequel wasn't 6-years later. Overall the story just seemed unoriginal compared to the first movie and there were no surprises.Bonus: there is a ""reindeers are better than people"" redux called ""Alone in the Woods"" that turns into a full blown 80s rock video duet with Sven and Kristoff that had me rolling."
"Frozen 2 was actually not in my top watchlist for 2019 films. The only reason why I decided to watch it was because of the trailer since I had no idea what was going on and what it was going to be all about.So I watched it almost 2 days after its release. And like wow, I did not expect any of it from the first.Like how they revealed the origin of Elsa's powers was unbelievable. The story was amazing and was somewhat carrying a deeper message than the original one.I liked how they managed to bring out more great songs which are actually better than the first. In terms of song, I would pick Frozen 2, with Kristoff's song ""Lost in the Woods"" being my most favorite.The writing was also amazing. Olaf was really funny whenever he is given the spotlight or have something to say. I liked the chemistry of the whole gang, and even Anna's relationship between Kristoff and Elsa.Overall, Frozen 2 was actually amazing. If I were to choose between the sequel and the original, I would have picked Frozen 2 in terms of story, songs and writing. Trust me, for those who are big fans of the 2013 masterpiece, you are definitely going to enjoy the 2019 sequel film."
"The movie was superb and I'm speechless as its too good to be commented and especially Elsa scenes in the movie and the songs 'into the unknown' and 'show yourself' was too good as the sound effects, song, the animation feature and many more of it was so nice. I enjoyed the movie when I first watch it with my friends and went for another 2 times because I couldn't resist it. I love Disney movies especially this movie. Thanks Disney and hope to do more movies like this. Im supporting this movie to get the best awards for the different aspects in the movie that has been nominated for and good luck for it."
Frozen 2 was very well done and it is the perfect sequel to the first movie!
"It feels like more or less a requirement that you go see this movie after seeing the first one. The plot had a few twists, they delivered on some good laughs, and I think everyone left happy. Some have criticised the plot for expecting the viewer to jump some story gaps, which I would mostly agree with. Job mostly well done however for a sequel with unattainable expectations.
That being said, the first 20 minutes had Elsa yelling every song. The beginning of the movie for me was a bit like accidentally jumping into a cold shower before it warmed up.
All in all, worth seeing. The old, the young, and anyone in between with or without kids will probably enjoy it. As a 30 year old guy, I do wish I had waited till it came out on Netflix so I would save myself $8 on popcorn."
Okay so i went to see this fully expecting to love what i got from this movie and mostly i liked it there is no real magic here as like in the first one but the movie is pretty good the laughs come full force and adventure comes too the story moves fast and is exciting but the magic is all gone in this one
The animation is 10/10 easily if you like animation watch this movie. The score is fantastic but not as catchy as the first movie. The singing in this movie will impress professionals and casual music listeners.Now when it comes to characters I feel they nailed it. Each character has grown slightly but still feel like the same characters from the first movie but just with a little growth occurring during the time between.The movie contains obvious morals for small children but also delves into more complicated ideas. I wish they had delved into the more adult themes more but through the songs I felt they did the themes a little more justice.
"It's not simple story which is interesting!!
Christopher's voice was so handsome 😂
I didn't expect the song by Panic at end rolls!!
The cast's voices are so lively and energetic.
I love it."
"A very good follow up filled with a lot of the magic and humour that made the original such a hit. The songs aren't as memorable and there's no signature power ballad, but the darker, more mature adventure and hardships the characters endure make it an engaging and emotional ride. It's different but similar plot, setting, superb animation and use of colour keeps it entertaining and enjoyable throughout."
"I am always reluctant to go and watch a Disney sequal, but it surprised me. What with its storyline of elsa's true calling and the songs just get better the more times you listen to them, I personally think the songs beat the first soundtrack, some may disagree. I am going to see it again to really take it in."
"I loved the sequel as much as the first one, and I understand why some people don't like it.
The sequel is much deeper, some may find it confusing of what they're trying to tell(on the other hand, young audiences can still enjoy it). The casts and composers did explained what message they're delivering from the story in many interviews, so that could easily solve the problem.
Some parts of the story did felt not as dramatic as expected, or a bit cliche, BUT that doesn't effect the entire movie that much, it's still good in general. Especially the visuals and music, they just nailed it again, it's ridiculously good."
Loved this movie! Wasnt expecting it to be sooo good! If you like Disney it's a must watch!
"Amazing stunning visual feast which keep running on yr mind but the song I find is too dragging and forgettable.the expressions of every character is so well execute by team.A safe card play by Disney but its still enjoyable and full of fun to watch it.everything is so beautiful specially Elsa.,😃"
"So my relationship with ""Frozen"" was that I saw it at the cinema, and liked it. Then watched it a bunch more times as I have a young child, I heard ""Let It Go"" more times that I cared to, but never really got burned out on the rest of the film, as some poor parents did - because of this, I went to ""Frozen 2"" without too much baggage and ready to be entertained, and the film mostly hits the mark.Years after the events of the first film, Elsa (Idina Menzel) is the Queen of Arendelle and is enjoying a steady life with her family, friends and people. However, she is drawn and distracted by a mysterious melodic call that she alone seems to be able to hear. When the city suffers from a series of natural disasters, the gang head to the Northern forests to explore the origins of Elsa's power and discover the secrets about their family.So I quite enjoyed ""Frozen 2"". Whilst the story is perhaps, even more straightforward than the first film (and you will be way ahead of the plots reveals most of the time) and (certainly at first hearing) none of the songs seem as catchy as they did with ""Frozen"", the film is wonderfully animated and performed by the vocal artists. It's also pretty funny, laugh out loud funny a few times. It's self referentially humour too, not as far as parody of itself, but with a few call backs and some moments where characters are embarrassed by their actions in the previous film.We didn't take my son, so I don't have first-hand opinion of the target audience, but the kids in the screening with me were well behaved throughout, which I took to me they were watching the film, rather than acting up. There are darker moments too, but again I didn't get the impression that my screening kids were actively upset.Personally, I think I still prefer the first one - but this was good and I'd happily see ""Frozen 3"" in a few years time."
"We all loved it! I have seen it twice and laughed, cried and thoroughly enjoyed it both times! My boys (5 & 3) loved it and all the kids we were with definitely enjoyed it. Including my 5 year old nephew, who exclaimed as soon as it ended how much he liked it and how he LOVED the songs. My son was singing the songs in the car on the ride home, and keeps talking about the movie. He isn't even that into the original Frozen. It's a bit more complicated than the first one, but personally I love this about it. The story and the messages are interesting, heartwarming, heart wrenching and beautiful. I will agree the ending feels is a little rushed but all in all it took little away from the film, and I left both times wanting to see it again."
"Frozen II is a stellar sequel that delivers everything that the first film brings, and then some. The animation is incredible, the songs are fantastic, and the characters work very well together. Disney never seems to disappoint, as they are always creating fun adventures like we've never seen before. The exploration of the past and its truth really creates an exciting plot that is very original. Overall, Frozen II is even better than its predecessor and it is a very fun and imaginative film!"
"Everything about this movie is better then the first. The songs are better, the story is more engaging and the characters aren't as dumb. Anyone saying this movie is bad is just seeking attention."
"Most of the time, a Disney sequel is not something the company should be proud of. From the variety of uninspired straight-to-video sequels of the 2000s the irritating, Emoji Movie-wannabe ""Ralph Breaks the Internet"", there's usually not a lot of positives to say about them. Be that as it may, however, Frozen II is surprisingly good, all things considered. It's not perfect, and it's not always 100% consistent with its' predecessor, but its' got enough humor and heart to make it worthwhile, and the soundtrack and visuals are a plus as well. While I didn't trust Disney to deliver at all with a sequel to Frozen, they pulled it off quite well, despite it not being a necessary addition to the original. I just hope they let this particular franchise be after this movie."
"After watching the movie and talking to my friends about the movie. Everyone ask was it better than the first Frozen. Also whitch one was is your favorite Frozen or Frozen 2. But looking deeper at the two movies I realized there is no real way to compare the two. They were two totaly different story lines with different songs and lyrics. Characters were beautiful in both movies, I couldn't say which one was better or witch is my favorite. Each are different and give off a different message. All in all Let's go kiss Hans, who is this Hans."
Set apart from the first Frozen the sequel beings more of a faster pace to the two sisters bond. There is a wonderful balance that is consistent from movie 1 to movie 2 building with drama unlike before. I enjoyed the adventure with some parts sad to watch it remained enjoyable with a savoury sweet balance.
"I liked it better than the first, the production took what was most striking and was successful in the first, that was the songs, Olaf had more space in the movie with his humor and the story was lighter but with beautiful meaning. I loved the songs"
"Eliminated the dead times, Frozen II is a great sequel, with large musical numbers, animation of Calaidad and the message that everything changes for better or for worse, is not superior to its predecessor but is a great film for ADOLESCENTS AND ADULTS"
"Absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVED this film! It was not a disappointment and we have been singing the soundtrack for 2 days.My little girl (age 4) loved it, although found it a little jumpy at times.I really love that Disney is continuing to do strong empowered lead female roles, and doing it well. They do let themselves seriously down in one area though...body image.Young children really look up to Anna and Elsa, girls especially are obsessed, and I think depicting them so slim is just disconcerting as a Mum to two girls. Several times during the film I couldn't help just focus on how Elsa seemed to be so much slimmer in this film. I just think they should Disney should be a bit mindful of the fact of the way they are portraying female characters.If it wasn't for this misgiving, I would have rated 10/10."
I went to see this with my 11 year old. About halfway through she leaned across and said 'why is there a song every 5 seconds?'. She did have a point! Nonetheless we enjoyed the film for what it was - an afternoon's entertainment.
"This film held my attention and my daughters' attention the entire movie. Comparatively, I felt Frozen 2 was a hundred times better than the first. The imagery, the music, the story, all blew me away. From ""Into the Unknown"" to ""Show Yourself,"" all the songs are full of emotion. It was funny, sad, heartwarming, and my girls have been acting it out since they went to see it!"
"Watched Frozen II amazing voice Performances from Kristen Bell(Fanboys) as Anna ,Idina Menzel(Wicked) as Elsa also starring Josh Gad(The Internship) as Olaf, Alan Jason Ritter(W.) as Ryder, Ciaran Hinds(The Sea) as Grand Pabbie, Jonathan Groff(Mindhunter) as Kristoff and Sterling K.Brown(Black Panther) as Matthias.This film was sequel while not the best of the revival era it was a great sequel better than the first Bring on Frozen III.
Amazing score Christophe Beck(The Muppets), Direction by Jennifer Lee(Wreck-It Ralph ) & Chris Buck(Tarzan) Better Than Frozen Bring On Frozen III 8/10"
"Frozen 2 really made that magic which Frozen made few years ago
Must watch in 3D"
"Frozen 2 manages to expand on the story of Anna and Elsa's parents. It continues to explore the relationship between the sisters and their different personalities uniting and clashing at times.
The film maintains the essence of the first one while expanding on the story in a non-too-forced way. Olaf is spectacular and Kristoff's subplot as he attempts to propose to Anna is very comical while adding another layer of conflict to the story. All of the characters are very solid and strongly crafted.
On the other hand, the revelations didn't feel as as big as they pretend to be (the grandfather being evil, Elsa's mother being the one who saved their father), and the film relies, maybe, a little too much on backstory. Still, it is very solid and the film is, in my opinion, up to the hype."
"This is the first film I've seen at the cinema since Avatar - I just couldn't wait for the DVD. It's truly beautiful, with wonderful graphics and rousing songs. I liked the story, too. It's definitely worth watching for all fans of the original movie. Of course, I've already pre-ordered the DVD and can't wait to see it again :)"
Trust me !! It's gonna be like bollywood movies60% sings 40%visual
I really loved this movie! Elsa's songs were the best. And the only thing wrong with the movie is that Krisof (sorry for spelling) didn't seem that important even though he was trying to propose to Anna. And there was no wedding so Frozen 3 is the wedding.
Watched this with my 7 yr old. She loved it. I was entertained. Story had a predictability - but I'm an adult whoose seen a movie or seven and read a book or twelve - my daughter was moved and shocked as you would expect so its not a problem. For a disney sequel it delivered.
"I saw Disney's second best animated sequel after Ralph Breaks the Internet, Frozen II with my family at AMC Garden State 16 in IMAX with Laser. And it was soooooooooooooo good!!!!!!!!!!! The songs were great, The voice acting was perfect, My favorite part is when Elsa remembers her childhood from the first film and changing her look in a newer way. My second favorite part is when the main characters are playing charades. The saddest part of the movie is when Olaf faded away into little snowflakes. But Elsa bought him back with her snow magic at the end. I didn't cry during this part. My favorite song of this movie is ""Into the Unknown"". I'm so glad that Elsa didn't sing the most annoying song from the first film ""Let It Go"" in this sequel. So please go see Frozen II! It's really good! And it has a lot of perfect songs! So please let it go!I give this movie 10/10."
"Great movie, taught rich values, reminded me of Pocahontas."
Okay so i took a warn out family to see this over thanksgiving holiday while i must say this movie has the heart and the pleasure is slightly missing here not the worst movie i must say but i really did enjoy it it moves fast and crams alot into it them movie really is good just not perfect like the first if your looking for a fun time with kids who cant see knives out or wont you b e my neighbor then this is perfect
The first is better than this sequel. But the animation is epic and the song is good. Bring your kids so they will enjoy after watch frozen 2
"Enjoyable throughout with most songs hitting the mark. It moves along too quickly to reasonably explain any of the events and their causes, all saying and very little showing. Although, it does mean it is a brisk hour and forty minutes and not the two and a half hour beast it needed to be to really set up the plot. The trade off is probably worth it."
"When Frozen II was announced parents around the world shed a nervous tick as chimes of Let it Go rang in their ears.Following after the events from the first film the first Act sets out the early plot lines for Elsa, Anna, Kristoff and Olaf, which quickly leads into adventure.The plot line intertwined nicely, balancing songs, humour and heartstrings. to reveal a dark past.The songs are not quite as catchy as the first Frozen and there is no true power ballad to match Let It Go (cue a sigh of relief from parents), but still are powerful and in true Disney fashion, tall a story while entertaining.I took my 4 and 6 year old nieces and they loved it from start to end."
"Is Frozen II a great film? Yes. Is it as good as or better than Frozen I? Nope. The only thing that I would say Frozen II is on a par with, with Frozen I, is visually. It is visually stunning. It might even be more visually stunning in places than Frozen I. But Frozen I has a better storyline and better comical moments; as a whole the film is just better, and it flows better. Frozen II has some great moments and some great comedy, but at times it feels rushed and it doesn't flow as well. Maybe I just need to see it again and it needs to grow on me, and there's such high expectations because the first film was literally, like, one of the best films ever! That's hard to follow and live up to, let alone exceed! But Frozen II is still absolutely a must-see film."
"Disney make Disney movies like Bambi and sleeping beauty and Peter plan pixar makes good movies like toy story 1 2 3 4 and monsters inc and Moana Brave. And Disney best 2019 live action like Aladdin and Mary Poppins and into the woods lady and tramp. Mulan too Disney did good work on Frozen 2 I don't care about people say about movie it's a fun movie
And tell people and kids to see Frozen 2 In Theaters all hail queen Anna it's good movie Disney will make best Disney 2019 reboot remake of best Disney movies happy"
"Don't let the dark trailers throw you off or confuse you. Frozen II, I'd say, is much lighter and more comedic than the first film from 2013. In fact, the scene that made it into the ""dark trailer"" was thrilling at most, nothing edgy or scary folks. Anyway, about the film... awesome.Filled with moving music pieces and a simple, easy to comprehend story that ties into the continuity of the first film like two pieces of a puzzle, Frozen II is a worthy pre-winter watch.As with Disney's recent CGI spectacles, Frozen II boasts a hyper-realistic, lifelike approach to their animation. At times I could almost feel like I were seeing real water and real skies, it's just that realistic!Frozen II also regularly references and throws hillarious gags and allusions to its predecessor. Personally they made the film for me, given that I was quite a fan of the first film. Oh, and have I mentioned Olaf is so freaking adorable?Endings are usually where modern blockbusters fall apart. Somehow, Frozen II was able to create a bittersweet yet logical ending without actually making you leave the theater with a frown. The script is far from perfect, especially in regards to how they placed their musical pieces, but it's doable at best.Absolutely worth the watch for kids! But I still reccomend it for adults and young teens looking to kill time. If you like fourth wall gags, this film is perfect for you."
"This movie is well worth watching. There were plenty of moments of humor, action, suspense, and sentiment. The songs were good too.. although it did feel like they were too frequent. You can't trust the reviews that trashed this movie. The only debate is where this movie sits between an 8 or 10. I gave it a 10!!!"
"Like the first movie, Frozen II also didn't have the main problem that makes by the main villain. It makes Frozen is so has a story that also fits an adult audience. The visual is so wonderful and make us bewitched. It can rise again magical animation era from Disney that present in the 90's. Frozen is the only best animation that has magical force from Disney in 2010's decade. But Frozen II didn't have a magical soundtrack- like the first movie because the arrangement of the song is not consistent. In one sequence so strict, and in other sequence so loose. I hope if it is a trilogy, it must be develope well because many people love all of this movie. From story, characters, until the song."
"Good story , mouth watering wardrobe.... but too many boring songs none can be compared to LET IT GO or LOVE IS AN OPEN DOOR!"
It's been years since the first movie a lot has changed - from the details to musical scoring. You can watch this without watching the first movie since they did a quick recap of what happened. The new setlist of songs are just alright - it does not leave a lasting impression and not as catchy as the ones from the first movie. I doubt there'll be a third one and most likely it's just going to be a live-action remake which would be more exciting than another sequel.
"Animated fantasy from Disney.This is a typical Disney production, aimed at pre-teen kids, especially girls.
Elsa and chums are on a journey to save the kingdom, they encounter some peril along the way. Thankfully Olaf provided some comic relief for parents. I'm not sure if there was such a catchy song as the original.Our 9 year-old granddaughter liked it, and didn't fidget much, and that was the reason for going, and so I can't really criticize with an adult perspective."
"I just watched it yesterday with my cousin (she went wild) and i was pleased with the animation. It just look flawless and realistic, props to all of the animator that work on this and i'm looking forward to what Disney offer us next. The storyline is decent because it's wasn't end in cliffhanger and really tell us what is going on (although they could really improve it) but sometimes it gets a little cringy (understandable, for kids). It got a good musical number and the voice actors really put their emotions for this movie (especially Kristen Bell on one of the scene). Overall this movie is good to watch with your little ones"
"I didn't watch the first Frozen (what~??) so I can't compare this to the original. The voice actors kept the characters fresh so I felt like I didn't need to catch up on their friendships; and there were moments when I almost cried.Maybe I'm just cynical, the story overtly checked off the corporate social responsibility checklist of respect for nature and ""do the next right thing"". I wish the theme was rendered more subtly, but then again, the plot had to be simple (gentle, and happy) enough for young audience.It was a tricky balance between cuteness (new plush doll ready character - super adorable gecko) and sadness. At the end of the day, the story reassured us that truth stands the test of time, love saves the day, and family tensions always resolve. This isn't Toy Story, which discussed serious themes with grown up audience in mind. But Frozen II is still an enjoyable ride."
Sike Olaf and Elsa did and if you spoil the movie you should to
This movie keeps you charmed during all the time you are watching it. The story about the Kingdom of Arendelle and the dangers and attacks it is facing is told by showing a group of characters very attractive in full action all the time.. Everything goes around the travelling through a magic forest by the characters including the charrming Anna and the puppet Olaf facing several obstacles. The music and the songs are also beautiful indeed. An animation movie that can profitably be seen by children and adults.
"Amazing! Beautiful! Magic! Better than the first part, althougt you think that is impossible. :) 10! 10! 10!"
"I saw this with my 2 and 3 yr. Old yesterday, and really enjoyed it! I don't have any critique that I think of really. Songs where fun, not as cringe worthy as the first. And the story was a great explanation of the world they lived in and Elsa power and personal growth. Anna had a great song about facing depression and how to move forward. And Krotof had me laughing out loudly with his rock ballet! Olaf was able to be funny like the first but not obnoxious. Over all I think it's a well done film that I wouldn't mind seeing again. Hope you feel the same!"
"Frozen 2 much exceeded my expectations and it couldn't get over the movie until now! (I watched the movie about a week ago) I went searching for everything related to the movie after I watched it.
The songs are amazing, voice actings are on point with all the emotions, characters development are so real!
I think the movie is a success because, on top of the songs and everything, they didn't use the same formula for their storyline as the prequel Frozen, instead, it's a totally different directions with unexpected twists. I cried when I watch the movie because the story build up from Frozen is so good that everything in Frozen 2 makes so much sense and became even more emotional, touching and so much more beautiful! I can literally feel and understand why the characters do what they do, say what they say.
Great job to the producing team and the voice actresses & actors!
Thank you for producing such a great movie for this generation.
(Secretly wishing there'll be Frozen 3 🙈)"
"Frozen 2- Experience this one of a kind magical journey that will leave you spellbound. It's one notch up with stellar story, smooth screenplay and the lovely characters. On top of it, the heavenly locations, northern lights and Elsa's quest is unimaginable. Bravo to story writers and visually stunning CGI. Frozen 2 is dozen times worth to be frozen in your memory."
"Frozen II was better than the first as far as a balance of seriousness and comedic timing. It was less ""Disney princess"" too which peaked my kids interest more this time around. It was not afraid to poke fun at itself and presented an overall better story even though it was quite predictable in the end. It's definitely worth watching over and over again!"
"Five takeaways: 1. Super entertaining. Wonderful visual, 2. Music wasn't memorable as the original but still great, 3. Elsa is the most beautiful disney princess, 4. Olaf is one of the funniest disney characters, 5. I want more duet of Kristoff and Sven."
"The movie looks amazing. The visuals where extremely well done. The jokes where better then the first one. Kristoffs song stood out because it was so funny.
But the movie was too predictable. It was hard to feel something when characters feel sad, because you can predict the outcome (I'm sorry if this is a spoiler).
Overall i enjoyed it, maybe even a little bit more then the first one."
"Animation is good, songs are lyrical and characters portrayed are upto mark, especially Olaf who, as per me, is like Sid of the Ice Age animation series. He is funny and keeps mood up. However, i cant resist comparing it to the first part.The biggest lag in this one was the story build execution time which was like of 20 minutes in whole 1 hr 45 minutes animation. This, as per me, was something which should have been explained and detailed rather making it brief. Elsa is trapped in ice and Anna need to relieve her, but that is only of like 10 minutes part. The moment i started getting excitement of watching more and to fullest, it ends. On the contrary, the first part had those details captured with proper span and time.Cant give more than 7 stars."
"I really can't stand musicals, like, the more they sing the angrier I got. But I like Elsa. She must have cut her hair, or something. And #Frozen2 established elemental magic in the world! Can't hate elemental magic. More magic battles for the third one please (3.5/5Scales)"
Best overall sequel ever. Great returning and new cast. Amazing storyline and songs. Over-the-top visual effects. Answered all questions I had from the first film. Can't wait for more.
"This was the best movie I have seen in the theatres EVER. The story is Incredible and well thought out, everything makes sense and I loved it! It was a rollercoaster of emotions. I was laughing and crying and grinning from ear to ear. If you haven't see it yet, then get your to the nearest theatre!"
"I took my kids to see this opening weekend, and we loved it. The visuals as everyone says are absolutely incredible, but contrary to some opinions I thought the story and the music were fantastic. ""Lost in the Woods"" was my absolute favourite, and I anticipate singing this song for a long time to come.Olaf's character did seem the most ""off"" to me, although he did provide some comedic relief which was appreciated by many.The story of Anna and Elsa was beautiful, and the backstory of their parents and the adventure they go on as a result was both magical and a serious tug at the heartstrings.Overall I say don't listen to the negative reviews - people are never happy anymore and I am not sure what they expected... but I would say from whatever expectations I may have had they were certainly surpassed.Well done again, Disney!"
"I thought it was a very good movie. I really enjoyed the sequel to Frozen, I loved the Show Yourself scene it was so powerful and like Let it Go part 2. I really loved Queen Iduna in the parts with her daughters all is found was so beautiful. I hope they will make a third movie if possible."
"2013's 'Frozen' not only became the biggest animated film at the global box office of all time, it was a true pop phenomenon in every household with little children screaming along to Elsa's rendition of 'Let It Go'. Six years have passed and Disney is re-visiting Anna, Elsa, Kristoff, Olaf and Sven who hastily have to leave Arendelle to travel to an ancient, autumn-bound forest of an enchanted land. They set out to find the origin of Elsa's powers in order to save their kingdom.Directors Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee are back to direct their sequel and have taken a darker approach to uncover the secrets of the kingdom of Arendelle. Whatever you thought you knew about the past and how this kingdom came to be, isn't as clean cut as you'd think it is. In an attempt to brighten up things, Olaf (Josh Gad) is still around with a series of incredibly funny jokes. Although, as soon as we arrive at a forest that's magically clouded in a glittery fog that won't let anyone enter, this family gets ready to embark on a rollercoaster of elemental proportions. No one is safe and the stakes are higher than ever before.Don't fear, this is still Disney and unfortunately this is still a kids-friendly story. 'Frozen II' changes the origin and its dark history behind everything we have learned about Arendelle in 'Frozen'. Anna (Kristen Bell) and Kristoff (Jonathan Groff) are still together, Sven is still as loyal as any reindeer could ever be and Olaf is enjoying the sun in his protective permafrost. But nothing lasts forever. An alarming voice (performed by Norwegian singer-songwriter Aurora) calling out to Elsa (Idina Menzel) to uncover the origin of her powers, earth giants, uncontrollable fires, mysterious gales spooking an entire community and an unknown menacing force in the water are definitely going to scare the smallest children, and some heartbreaking moments will fly right over their heads, while the adult crowd will try to control their sobbing.Especially Idina Menzel's voice work is almost perfect, with an evolving character arc that goes right back to the start and is beyond impressive. The newest main single ""Into the Unknown"" (with a radio version performed by Panic at the Disco) is catchy and will get stuck in your head. Where Kristen Bell was the original MVP in 'Frozen', this time her Anna becomes almost annoyingly whiny, and the solo song she's given is one the weakest on the soundtrack. Jonathan Groff's rendition of ""Reindeer(s) Are Better Than People"" is a fun mix of 80s/90s rock-pop - visuals and over-the-top musical arrangements included.Emotionally manipulative and with some heavy context regarding colonialism and in some ways also global warming, 'Frozen II' is much more mature than its predecessor. The songs might not be as grand and memorable as the well known tunes of 'Frozen', but the rest of the film makes up for that loss. Magical, transformative, exultant and one heck of an unforgettable journey."
"It may sound a bit odd, but the movie tries to frame too much into too short of a time space. The plots are interesting but feel a little rushed. This movie could have been stretched out into a decent TV series and would have benefitted from it.Overall, I liked it. I think I liked a little more than the first one. However, this movie feels more like a fantasy adventure rather than a Disney princess film. So go in knowing what to expect."
"Where to begin. Frozen 2 is one of the best Disney films I've ever seen. it made me laugh and cry. If you're Scandinavian you'll love this film. This movie brought so many legends I grew up hearing into one movie. Olaf dying temporarily made cry but thankfully all is good in the end. This movie brought me so much joy and I'm so excited for my small cousins to grow up having this to watch. For me, this hit the mark. I've never seen my culture depicted into a children's movie before and waiting over 20 years to see it... it was perfect. Despite what others say the plot was perfect, I adored it. It is a darker plot but none of the less is rather incredible and still suitable for children. This movie also have an amazing meaning behind it and I think this film is suitable for all ages."
"Even though ""Frozen 2"" might be a little less inviting than its predecessor, this sequel still offers viewers, young and old, a universal message we can all relate to.
.
In this family film and sequel to the 2013 hit film, Anna, Elsa, Kristoff, Olaf and Sven leave Ardendelle and set out to find the origins of Elsa's powers.
.
Beautifully animated with terrific voice acting, ""Frozen 2"" will have little Elsa and Anna's glued to the screen for the entire journey. I did find this sequel to have too many musical moments but the songs will nonetheless stay stuck in your head for days. The magic of Disney. Overall a good sequel, but I did enjoy the first film much more."
"It's been six years since the first one. Visual effects, art, dubbing, and soundtracks are all outstanding, the script tho is not as good as the first one, and some song and dance implants are slightly awkward Overall, a Okay sequel okay movie"
"Suddenly something wrong happens and the main character gets involved ... the theory of movie story is so but this is different. A peaceful state of the town is drawn, a peaceful state of the family is drawn, and the main story progresses slowly. And suddenly, a big problem occurs, but it's a little too late. I didn't feel that something serious has happened. It is a mistake in the story structure. I wasn't taken with the story without feeling in the theme of the main characters. I was bored more and more in this story because the family drama came into the story. When I started thinking that it was time to sleep, the beautiful scene came. The beautiful scene is a scene where a theme was born. I wasn't' sympathized with characters until here but suddenly I was. It is a scene where her sister ..... Suddenly, there born a theme that she have to do. I was impressed at this point. I was impressed that the theme was born after enduring a long boring scene, and I was able to get into the movie. Humans are greatly impressed by the small excitement after pain. However, since the first half of the explanation of relationship and situation were good, so, this impression was born ... I let praise the scenario writer for the time being. Also, this scenario writer was good at drawing climax, and from then on it seemed interesting to the end. The use of gorgeous music was also effective. A movie theater called Corona World in Japan that I entered this time, recently seems to have changed its sound effects system. The seat vibrates when the heavy bass sounded. So, powerful music became more effective. I was glad that I'm glad because I was able to leave the cinema while feeling that it was a pretty good movie. However, I can't deny that the story wasn't completely written, and I wasn't satisfied.
By the way, the sound quality of Corona World's new sound system is the worst. The sound was just like a cheap boombox turned up."
"Had a look at the hashtag for this movie. One photo was a mom and her toddler, caption: ""we loved it"" (mom smiling, toddler looking confused)
Then checked the IMDB user reviews, one stating all 50 children in the cinema seemed confused and disappointed.Someone else screencapped one of the voice actors Tweeting ""sing the songs til 2023"" and separately, a scheduled Disney release date for November 2023, so there's likely gonna be a third one. As a movie it seems like further background characterization aimed specifically at adult fans.The songs are unmemorable, wordy and miserable, with lyrics that aren't gonna be interesting for kids. Olaf even sings that it will ""make sense when I am older.""A positive is I really like how the female characters move when their full body is shown.I am hopeful for maybe some actually catchy songs, an interesting or at least logical plotline, and maybe a return to some of the themes from the first movie in the prospective 3rd movie. For context, I really liked the first one, have it on DVD, have 4 Frozen dolls (I am a doll collector) and related to Elsa in the first one.The second one leaves me questioning what is its purpose in the franchise. It adds nothing to the plotline, the character development has taken a step back - Elsa, running away again, Elsa, unable to control her powers again. Anna, cheerily trying to fix things again. Kristoff has gone from being placid and blase to romantic hero attempting to propose, which is just an entirely different character than what he was in the first.The most memorable bit is probably Anna singing a song about being depressed, literally Johnny Cash ""Hurt""-tier. The climax is random and ill-fitted to the fantasy world this exists in, nor the powers Elsa is bestowed with.It seems almost like they picked it out of a hat from maybe another 50 plots written on post-its. The animation is disjointed between scenes but also very well done, which suggests outsourcing to huge teams of people.My hope for the third movie is more cohesive scenes, better communication between teams of animators, and a good plotline set in stone early in production rather than a collection of randomly arranged setpieces as this ends up being."
I liked this film quite a bit. The visuals were amazing and of course the soundtrack INTO THE UNKNOOOWN was very beautiful. Plot was quite predictable and the storyline took me a while to understand lol but it was very good with good songs woo
"When you make people wait seven years for a sequel to one of the highest grossing films ever, you've got to give it your all. This is what Disney did with 'Frozen II', but perhaps they overplayed. Well, let me go into more detail.The premise of Elsa being called by a lovely voice, causing her to go in search of answers about her past, is a clever turn of events. The Arendelle sisters have an interesting enough backstory to make their origins the focus of the entire sequel. The film achieves this, but somehow the personal mystery gets a little undercut by pointless politics. It's still a fine plot, but I think more explanation concerning Anna and Elsa's parents, and the girls' own charisma, could've held it together alone.The songs are good, but none as good as the tunes from the first one. The only ones that really stand out are Elsa's 'Into the Unknown' and 'Show Yourself'. I think part of the reason these melodies are successful is beacause they are during important scenes, and explaining powerful emotions. Most of the other songs are just sitting there, with no purpose, just kind of stating the obvious. I'm guessing the composers felt pressed to churn out ""the next big 'Frozen' song"" and put together some generic stuff for kids to lip sync to.The animation and landscape is, of course, wonderful. You can always count on 'Frozen' to have beautiful natural sourroundings, not to mention great gowns. Disney would do well to market clothing inspired by Anna and Elsa for grown women, not just toddlers.I sort of got the feeling the makers were trying too hard to give us something elaborate, when the viewers would've been happy with a more simple basis. But ultimately, 'Frozen II' really is fun, if a bit complex, and Olaf is hilarious, so it's plenty entertaining to take in(-to the unknoooooooown!)."
"Is Frozen II an improvement on the original? No, but it's okay. It brings together the group of characters we've grown to love, with stunning animation and new ballads. A little anticlimactic, but your kids will still love it."
"And didn't disappoint! Yes it's different from the first film, but it works. Visually it's stunning, the musical numbers were funny and moving and the story line didn't feel forced or contrived. Our whole family enjoyed it, we laughed a bit, we cried a bit and we left with that yummy warm all over feeling. Give it a chance and make up your own mind, I think you'll enjoy it."
"I was still in my pre-teen years when Frozen (2013) came out and took the world by storm. In the time it was in theatres, I saw the film a total of 4 times, followed by several on streaming services and DVD. Frozen 2 is just as great of a film, but for different reasons than the first. Although both are rated G and are made by Disney, this movie takes a more dramatic villain-less plot, which is something that the first almost achieved if it hadn't been for the final 20 minutes. Nevertheless, Frozen 2 offers heart and great messages for kids.The film opens to find baby Elsa and Anna building snowmen once more before bed. As the two doze off, their father, the king, tell them the story of when he was little, there was an enchanted forest filled with people known as Northuldra's. One tragic day, the two colonies burst into civil war due to a dam being built and the king was knocked unconscious, before being saved by an unknown person. As the sisters demand a happy ending, the queen (Evan Rachel Wood) sings them a lullaby about a mystical river which gives you all of the answers your heart desires named Ahtohallan. (""All Is Found"")3 Years After Elsa's Coronation, Kristoff (Jonathan Groff) prepares to ask for Anna's hand in marriage, but is too quirky to find the right words. During this time, Elsa (Idina Menzel) hears an enchanting voice singing to her (""Some Things Never Change""). That night, while playing Charades, Elsa seems disoriented, for she realizes that only she can hear the voice. Unintentionally, Elsa awakens the elemental spirits of the world, Fire, Water, Earth, and Air. (""Into The Unknown""). The kingdom and town of Arrendale are evacuated.Grand Pabbie warns Elsa the dangers if she were to follow this voice, thus making Anna (Kristen Bell), Kristoff, Sven, and Olaf (Josh Gad) go with her. The group enters the enclosed Enchanted Forest, but are caught up in a trap tornado. Elsa freezes it, as sculptures of the tribe's past are presented. It is revealed that the queen was a Northuldra, and saved the king that day. (""When I Am Older"") Elsa realizes that there is a fifth spirit that exists which balances elements with nature.As the troupe settles down for the night, Kristoff meets Ryder, who attempts to help him create Anna's dream proposal. Elsa cannot sleep for she hears the voice continuously and encourages Anna and Olaf to come along. Anna ponders of Kristoff's whereabouts, but is immediately taken away by the journey ahead. Kristoff, returning back to camp, realizes Anna has left and thinks that its his fault (""Reindeers Are Better Than People (Reprise)/Lost In The Woods""). The Trio finds their parents' shipwrecked ship and notices that the map was conducted to get to Ahtohallan. Disgusted by the fact that her parents died while trying to look for answers about her powers, Elsa pushes Anna and Olaf away, who are angered.Elsa, alone, arrives at Ahtohallan, with help from the water horse from her visions. The river has been frozen over, but it does not matter, for the rivers powers still shows visions. The voice ends up to be her mothers call from beyond the grave, to finish what their parents initial plans are. (""Show Yourself"") Elsa finds out that Arendelle was actually the villain of the past. Their grandfather did not die a hero, for he murdered the leader of the Northuldra's. Having gone too far into the river, Elsa freezes in position and sends out one last crying call to Anna. Anna and Olaf, now trapped in a cave, learn the truth that the Dam was built to trap the Northuldra's. Without Elsa, Olaf begins to fade away in Anna's arms. Anna, defeated, without a sister of best friend, stands and realizes she must put an end to the war (""The Next Right Thing"").Anna finds her way out of the cave and awakens the giants, who roam the north lands of the Northuldra's camps at night. Anna realizes that the dam needs to be broken in order for the Northuldra's to be free from the curse put upon them. With help from Arendellian soldiers, who have been stuck in the camp since the great battle, the dam is successfully broken and the curse is lifted. Kristoff and Anna worry since the dam waters would destroy Arendelle. Elsa is awoken is rescued by Nokk, the water horse. They race to the kingdom to stop the water from destroying their kingdom, which they do successfully with help from Elsa's powers. The sisters revive Olaf, but are separated, since Elsa realizes that she is the fifth element, she must stay with the Northuldra's and crowns Anna queen of Arendelle. Kristoff successfully proposes to Anna, as the three of them head back for Anna's coronation.Frozen 2 offers a more mature take on our favourite group of friends, but that doesn't mean its any less magical than the first. Recently, Disney movies and especially Disney sequels are horrendous and merely unwatchable (I'm looking at you Maleficent: Mistress of Evil). But this one, was just a great story once again done by Kristen Andersen and Robert Lopez. The reason why this movie isn't getting a perfect score, is because I feel as if this movie does not know who their audience is. I feel it is for the people who were kids when the first came out, and now that they're more mature. Nevertheless, Frozen 2 gets a 9.3/10."
"I have just seen the film Frozen II and I was surprise how good is it - good characters, good music, good story, very good ecological message - really strong ecological message that we must repair mistakes from the past and respect the nature, listen to the nature. it is about peace and forest. I felt so wonderful that the things will change into good direction after this film but my enthusiasm stopped when I have seen new Disney toys : made of plastics and with batteries, nothing ecological about it. what happened? Disney didn't watch their own film? they didn't understood it is a time for the good actions? how they can sell not ecological toys after such film????? how Disney could missed such opportunity to do something really good? it is easy to do a film about ecology but to really change people are too stupid."
"Movie is just 1 step behind part 1 madness. Part 1 was very cute. This part is too complex to understand for a five year old. My daughter couldn't understand the story. She only enjoyed great VFX effects.
Also why Priyanka Chopra was chosen for hindi dubbing. Priyanka Chopra voice was too matured for Elsa. Elsa is beautiful but hindi dubbed voice is not matched with her personality. Elsa voice in part 1 was awesome. Preeniti chopra was very good as Anna. She did awesome job in dubbing as she mocked Anna's naughtiness and her personality."
"This was a delight to watch, there's many breathtaking, beautiful, heartfelt and funny moments in this movie. The songs are amazing - the animated performance of 'Into the Unknown' is worth the watch on its own. Idina Menzel's voice is so soulful and enchanting. Another highlight was the new character Lieutenant Mattias.
I hope to see it again before it leaves theatres!"
"I love Frozen 1 because I watched it when I was young. I'm crazy about Frozen 2 because I'm changed and older. No need to compare to the first one, Frozen 2 has its own charming. Everyone need to be changed by time, but they're still a familly that full of love and supportation. If there is no Frozen 1, I will give 10 point for Frozen 2. For anyone who feel Frozen 2 is making no sense, just watched again after you change something of yourself. Thanks for reading and merry xmas."
"In general Frozen 2 is a much better movie that the first, it is really a well done movie by people that know their craft, but the songs are less catchy and the story is more complicated than the first one, younger kids may be confused by it. I enjoyed it and will watch again but my 6 year old daughter just wants to see the first one again."
"If you're wondering what's fine wrong with Hollywood over the last 5 years, you're not alone. Figures like Patti Jenkins and Kathleen Kennedy have undermined tinsel town and driven destructive politics into kids movies.
Frozen 2 has been spared. It's a film of love and happiness. At no stage do you feel like characters are being judged by their skin colour (despite the female leads). Disney have either seen the error of their ways or the right people were involved with making this film.
We talk today about films that are good role models for young girls. Most films today are poor examples. This film reminds me of the old-school Disney princesses and it's great to see that coming back in vogue.
If you're worried about boys being bored, there's plenty to keep them entertained. They probably won't love it but they should enjoy it.
This film is not political. There's no sexism or racism. It's one of the better Disney flicks I've seen for girls in a while (at least, similar to Frozen). Whomever controlled the bullies in Disney - thank you! You have earned my respect for this film. Looks like Disney is going ""old school"" again and it's about time!"
"I went into this movie with low expectations thinking it was solely a play on a Disney franchise opportunity... so naturally I cringed at the introduction being song after song after song... but eventually it had off beat witty humor that any parent can enjoy. I loved watching it with my child and will gladly watch again.
If you go into understanding it's not the first frozen, but still carries some traces, you shouldn't be disappointed."
"I went into this movie with skeptism- sequels are never better than the first movie.Wrong!I think I may have loved Frozen II better than the original Frozen movie. Together, Frozen and Frozen II make a perfect story.Frozen II ties everything together like a perfectly packaged present. Olaf was hilarious and made me laugh out loud a lot. Parts of the movie were a little predictable, but it didn't take away from the power and intensity of the moments. Some of the songs were so-so, but I definitely had a few favorites I wouldn't mind having stuck in my head. I felt like the ended was perfect. I walked out wondering when I would get to watch this movie again.My 8 and 5 year old loved it as well. My son was cheering for the sisters and was intrigued the entire time. Definitely recommend seeing this movie!"
"I'll start by saying this is a great movie and a great sequel to ""Frozen"". I love the buildup to the adventure the audience is about to go on. The opening songs are great and set the tone for the film. Once the adventure starts the movie picks up and begins to explore the world of Frozen. It's a deep and interesting world that you want to explore. This film is a more mature and darker film that is great for all ages. My biggest issue is the third act. It feels off because of certain character decision and the pacing. The climax feels rushed as well as some character relationships. The animation is top notch and the acting is amazing. The music is just as memorable as the first and will be played to death. I prefer the first but this is a great and worthy sequel."
"The second Frozen movie is all about change! What a great way to write a movie for an audience that first fell in love with Anna and Elsa 6 years ago! An audience that has gone through so much change. This movie felt mature, funny, creative, and satisfying. Not to mention it's stunning animation and beautiful music. Go see it."
"I get the point of everyone's critiques , it's a lot and the story may become a bit confusing at a certain time but it is so magical ! This movie is the door for a lot of the unanswered questions in the first movie - where does the Elsa's powers come from ? Why did their parents go on that ship ?....
The film offers so much color, fun and emotion , an exciting and captivating new adventure , besides the stunning animation ( the water looks more realistic than the actual water )
And the musicality is perfect, the background music fits perfectly in every moment. The songs are beautiful, ""into the unknown "" may not become the phenomenon of ""let it go"" but is nonetheless a fantastic music where Idina Menzel shows, once again, her huge talent and so does Kristen Bell and the rest of the amazing cast ! (Olaf's randomness is the most funniest thing ever).
And finally this is a much more mature film than the first one. While the first talks about self love and acceptance, Frozen II shows each character's most sensitive and deep side, as well the overcoming of their fears.
Truly recommend !"
"Either you love it more than the first one ore hated more, there is no in between. the story is not the typical princess disney story and i think the songs are not as good as the first one but i like this movie more. the love between the sisters is still a central topic in this movie, although it focus more on finding a purpose of life, finding oneself."
"I would give the visual aspect 10/10, excellent job Disney, FULL power of CGI. The story is mysterious and different, it will keep you excited to know what's next, with good surprises. So much laughs and giggles with Olaf. The songs are a bit too many this time but few of them are amazing. Still none of them surpassed ""let it go"" in my opinion."
"After a 6 year wait, Frozen has finally made a comeback, and it is as good as the first sequel. The story line was fantastic as it was very connected to the first movie, connecting lots of characters that were not included in the first movie but still made it look so flawless. Each character was played to perfection, especially Olaf and Kristoff, who was outstanding in the second sequel, bringing laughs in every scene that they're in. Most importantly, they still managed to showcase the power of their sisterhood in managing conflicts, and it touches me every moment of the movie. All i can say is, this movie is going to be a huge hit once again, with new songs and story line in the arsenal, they will reach top of the table in no time.
By the way, Anna is gorgeous!"
"If this came out first, I think Frozen one wouldn't have been classed as better, but it didn't and like many sequels it's inferior.That said, good songs, good storyline and tee'd up for a 3rd."
"Good animation, quite interesting story line related to some old and good movies, nice,cute and funny songs (Kristoff song, even if it was romantic, it had a funny animation and a '90 vibe). It is Disney and it is supposed to be predictable. As an adult I could easily guess most of the things, but for a child it isn't the same and for them is a happiness to get a new Frozen movie. In addition to this Elsa's search about herself shows us how important is to love ourselves and constantly discover something new about us. A good lesson for the kids and adults too. So, let's be honest that this is still one of the best movies from Disney."
"Althought some audiences supposed that it wasn't as good as the first but i think it is a breakthrough for producer . Not talk about content , just focus on visual effects and sound effects that are enough to know how did they try during a long time , Edit every little details etc..
Elsa is better than before but not only her anna is much more ( brave which she owned from the past , love and one thing that is indispensable is optimism . The story tells us about the source of the frozen but director also doesn't forget to teach us how to keep the solidarity with the generations , the image of the two sisters who rule the two places is always the most understandable image of the film.  i wish you guys have fun watching frozen 2"
"The story is well connected with Part 1. Songs could have been lesser and better.
Overall a good movie and deserves a watch!"
"While the plot was a bit predictable, the movie as a whole was quite enjoyable until the end. Truly deserves a solid 8/10. It could have been a 10 if the ending was handled better. One simple change could have made the whole impact of the film that much more important. It could have sent a message about rebuilding, communities coming together, and the importance of acknowledging the past. But instead it whiffs on these to use magic as a quick and easy solution. I feel that the movie had the potential to tell these difficult stories, and I was a bit disappointed it did not."
"As a 16 year old who was 10 when the first film was released, this film was exactly what I expected and it did not disappoint. If you're comparing the sequel to the original then no it does not come close. But did I still thoroughly enjoy the two hours I sat in the cinema surrounded by 9 year olds and their parents? Yes! The film delivers a new generation of belters that will be stuck in your head for days after and the light heartedness to put a smile on your face throughout the film. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoyed the first film as it lives up to its expectations."
A great movie for all. Go for it. Went with young kids and they glued to the movie and me too.
"As long as you don't compare it with the first Frozen, you will enjoy the movie. It's a good adventure!But if your expecting it too be as good as the original (like many people who didn't like the movie), you will be disappointed."
"First of all Iove the voice acting (Idina Menzel, Kristen Bell, Josh Gad, and Jonathan Groff) are incredible! I love that we can know more about Arendelle's history and their parents and their relationship with them. The songs are beautiful and amazing! Especially ""Show Yourself""! It's a showstopper I liked it more than ""Into The Unknown"" I love Elsa's new dress, ""The Next Right Thing"" is beautiful the message it gave to me is inspiring it's about sadness and depression and how to stand up and escape the sadness you feel, Kristoff is so sweet all he wanted is to be with and propose to Anna (which he did at the end) and certainly the most but not the least Olaf is hilarious he made me laugh and feel more connected to him. And the connection and interactions with the core four are great I truly felt their love and importance to each other. The animation is amazing they really made Elsa, Anna, and Kristoff more beautiful! The hair is everything! Their hair are more believable and it moves whatever are they doing, the environment is fantastic and the elemental spirits are magical I was surprised that Bruni the salamander is the Fire Spirit! However I have plenty of problems about the sequel: it's pacing felt rushed I didn't even realized when Anna waked the Earth Giants, the third act felt short but I really guarantee it could have been better the new characters was underdeveloped I want to know them more but Liteunant Mattias I love him truly. I love the humor and some callbacks on the first film, I laughed and enjoyed it especially Elsa's shade to Hans it was funny for me but I don't know about everyone else. And I love the characters growth development and relationship to each other as I mentioned it before their chemistry are everything to me. Overall a great film a fun sequel an amazing fantasy film! Because that's what Disney Animation is all about right? That's what they're known for. That's all!"
"The film was great the animation is fantastic, the songs are compelling too! The songs truly have great messages and their voice acting (Idina Menzel, Kristen Bell, Josh Gad, Jonathan Groff) are incredible! However, I have some problems with the script it felt messy but it's great but felt messy and the pacing is fast I didn't even realized it ended and then the third act felt short because I thought it's just the beginning of it but I was wrong. But Overall, it's fantastic I love the surprises this film gave! They made a new dress for Elsa, a song for Kristoff, Anna is incredible she's more mature then ever before! And Olaf is hilarious he made me laugh and smile throughout the film and I felt sorry for him when he vanished. And the humors made me laugh and the callbacks to the first film felt nostalgic. And one more thing I don't like and love about the film, 1st: There are no stakes at all and the new characters felt underdeveloped but I love Lieutenant Mattias. 2nd: I love the emotions the actors gave to their characters and the characters' chemistry are great I love their interactions and I really felt they love and cherish each other. That's all!"
"Let's start with the elephant in the room. It can't ever be the first. Anyone who bases a review on that fact alone should go to film school and let's see what you can do (#BrianTruittUSAToday). If you had that expectation, you should honestly give up on seeing movies altogether. This film had an amazing story - one that had to have begun as an idea before the first one was a smash hit - because it's too good otherwise. The cinematography was 4x as good as the first. And the music - which can't beat the first - still got audible applause from the audience at multiple moments throughout the movie. Bravo!"
"I find this movie and the Death Stranding have a very similar core concept, which is the isolation, or the loneliness between people. I would say the storyline is not extraordinary but not bad. However, the music pieces in the movie are great - especially the All is Found - I found this song actually very suitable to be used in the Death Stranding when you're crossing the snowy mountain walking alone. Then you can fell the loneliness in the song.
By the way, the technical part showed in the movie was terrible - that liquid simulation really surprised me a lot."
"When it first was announced, I thought this was going to be unnecessary and a money grab, but wow was I wrong! Disney ended up delivering one of their most complex movies about the things that change in life and the things that always stay the same.While some of the characters are more chess pieces than actual characters, the heart remains in the characters of Anna and Elsa.
It's moving, it's dark, it's funny, it's captivating, the visuals are phenomenal, and it's surely one of Disney's best!"
"The music was good again, except for Kristoff's solo song - I found it to be a cheesy rock of ages type of thing. Don't get me wrong, cheesy rock of ages stuff is fun, just not in Frozen, IMO. Their voices are all amazing. There were at least two songs that gave me chills. And Panic at the Disco with the credits version! Nice.The plot was exciting, albeit confusing. I found it hard to follow in the first half of the movie. I won't give anything away, it just shows a conflict between two groups of people and there was a lot going on in the initial explanation... I didn't really get it (or care for that matter) until about halfway through. When they started discussing Anna and Elsa's parents - that's when it got good and we got invested.I do want to see it again - I'd watch it with a different perspective and see where I faltered in my initial understanding of the plot. I just think kids probably wouldn't understand the storyline much either."
"I just loved this movis, I thought it was a wonderful, creative and perfect movie to its predecessor. The story was quite phenomenal, nothing was really wasted, though the songs a little much and can interfere slightly with the story and even fell like a mechanism used to buy up some time. The songs were good though, obviously some more memorable than others but they were all good ones though. So back to the story...... From the beginning we have an introduction to the past of Elsa and Anna's mom (Important structure for the movie) and we soon find that after Elsa hears a voice and unlocks the 4 elements, the real stuf begins. We then see the relationship of the people in the forest (forgot their name LOL) And the people of Arendelle; which is quite tense (Due to something the Grandfather did). Also, it was just hilarious, literally every other part the WHOLE audience was bursting out laughing and I myself (Who normally doesn't laugh much) even was laughing too. You can't lie about the stunning atmosphere about the movie; the animation----BEAUTIFUL, You will be blowwwwn away! This is an amazing movie! Go see it if you haven't!!!!"
"Such a change of pace from the first movie, better in every aspect! A must see!"
"The music was great, the visuals were amazing and the story was meaningful. I'm not sure where people are getting the idea that the story was flat. I thought it was way better then the first. Elsa finding herself, The message about how life is always changing but love is unchanging, Anna picking herself up and trying to live life after a great loss. I thought some of the story was too much for my four year old to follow but he was impressed by the music and visuals so everyone left happy."
"It happens about 50 minutes into the film. Maybe the third line of a first verse. Notes travel downwards, pretty simple, but executed with a laziness behind the voice. Look forward to Demi Lavato's cover that's no doubt about to follow."
Watched twice in a day. Beautiful music and scenes. Disney did a wonderful job!
"With many songs and connections from frozen 1
It's rlly good"
"This is the first time that I'm rating a movie on IMDB, it was amazing and I'm pretty sure kids will love it, it has lowkey mature parts that made this fiilm amazing."
