"I was a person that saw all the hype and claims of masterpiece as overreacting and overblown excitement for another Joker based film. I thought this looked solid at best and even a bit too pretentious in the trailer, but in here to say I was incredibly wrong. This is a massive achievement of cinema that's extremely rare in a day and age of cgi nonsense and reboots. While this is somewhat of a reboot of sorts, the standalone origin tale is impeccable from start to finish and echoes resemblance to the best joker origin comics from the past. Joaquin bleeds, sweats, and cries his every drop into this magnificently dedicated performance. Heath Ledger would be proud. This is undoubtedly the greatest acting performance since Heath's joker. The directing and writing is slickly brilliant and the bleak settings and tones are palpable throughout. When this film was over the place was blown away and every audience member was awestruck that they witnessed a film that could still transport them into a character's world and very existence. Believe the hype. This is going to be revered as a transcending masterpiece of cinema."
"Every once in a while a movie comes, that truly makes an impact. Joaquin's performance and scenography in all it's brilliance. Grotesque, haunting and cringy. Hard to watch at times,... but so mesmerizing, you won't blink an eye watching it. Tragic, but with seriously funny moments. Emotional rollercoaster - sometimes, with multiple emotions popping-up at the same time.this is far from a typical action-riddled predictable super-hero movie - it's a proper psychological thriller/drama, with the single best character development I have ever seen."
"Most of the time movies are anticipated like this they end up falling short, way short. Joker is the first time I was more than happy with the hype. Please ignore the complaints of ""pernicious violence"" as they are embarrassing to say the least. We haven't seen a comic movie this real before. If we ever ""deserved"" a better class of criminal - Phillips and Phoenix have delivered. This is dark, Joker IS dark and you will fall in love with the villain as you should. The bad guys are always more romantic anyway."
"This is a movie that only those who have felt alone and isolated can truly relate to it. You understand the motive and you feel sorry for the character. A lot of people will see this movie and think that it encourages violence. But truly, this movie should encourage each and every one of us to become a better person, treat everyone with respect and make each other feel like they belong in this world, instead of making them feel isolated."
"Truly a masterpiece, The Best film of 2019, one of the Best films of the decade... And TRULY the Best film to bring a comic book so chillingly and realistically to real ife.
Remarkable Direction, Cinematography, Music and the Acting.
I don't understand why critics are surprised to find it DISTURBING and VIOLENT, when the title character is infamous for it and fans were already rooting for this.
OSCARS are on their way!"
"Joaquin Phoenix gives a tour de force performance, fearless and stunning in its emotional depth and physicality. It's impossible to talk about this without referencing Heath Ledger's Oscar-winning performance from The Dark Knight, widely considered the definitive live-action portrayal of the Joker, so let's talk about it. The fact is, everyone is going to be stunned by what Phoenix accomplishes, because it's what many thought impossible - a portrayal that matches and potentially exceeds that of The Dark Knight's Clown Prince of Crime"
"Let me start off by saying if Joaquin Phoneix doesn't get his Oscar for this movie. Then the Oscars should be cancelled. Phoneix is amazing as you might've heard from every review ever! But Todd Phillips. Is at his best here. The story lines he takes and visuals are just breathtaking. The score!! Omg the Score! Every time that score came on, I felt very uncomfortable, like something horrible was about to happen. It was GREAT. The Inspirations from Taxi Driver and King of Comedy are there, and add so much for the movie. And I got to be honest. There are scenes that are very violent. And its disturbing. But I honestly expected it to be WAYYYY more violent from all the controversy going on. Overall this movie was GREAT. Come Oscar season, it needs to be nominated for Best Picture, ScreenPlay, Cinematography, Actor, Score and Director"
"I get why some people hate this . It's because of the political message and how some people think that you need get empathy for Arthur's madness. But come on that is not the point and it will never be. Enjoy this masterpiece because Joaquin Phoenix and Todd Phillips overdid themselves with this movie . The acting,music and cinematography are just amazing ! Please enjoy the movie without overthinking it."
"I have seen Joker yesterday at Venice an early ill-fated screening. We had some trouble with audio that lead to a near-hour delay, but it definitely was worth it.Joker deserved to be presented at Venice Film Festival, an event that regards cinema as a form of art, because this film is far from a blockbuster or a mere entertainer movie, as most films in the genre are.It focuses on the psyche of the main character, as it slowly crumbles under the pressure of society. And thus, Joaquin Phoenix does a wonderful performance, earning almost surely a nomination at the oscars at least.
It's a take on the Joker that differs from Ledger's, but I'd say that both are equally as good. The main difference might be that Ledger's joker is a rational that acts insane, while Phoenix's is insane to the root.Despite being a movie about a superhero villain, Joker is much superior to most of the movies of the genre (I'd exclude the Dark Knight Trilogy only, but Joker is easily as good as Nolan's movies, or at least very close). It is a small-scaled film, with a distinct style and cinematography (that cannot but be appreciated) and a set of very cinephile references that however do not feel too forced or overly opressive. (most notable are the similarities to Scorsese's 'Taxi Driver' and his 'The King of Comedy', but also Chaplin's 'Modern Times' is somewhat referenced).I am eager to see more non-comedic efforts by Todd Phillips. This movie was so far probably the best of 2019 (at worst contested so far only by Dolor Y Gloria or Once Upon a Time in Hollywood), and that should be very convincing."
"It's sad that Joaquin missed Oscar for 'The gladiator' as he was very compelling Villain. But I am quite confident he will win it for the 'Joker'. Damn what a movie !!! Keeps u on the toes all the time. Unpredictable storyline and really a deep interesting plot. Did I forget to mention acting ? Damn Do niro and Joaquin teach u what really is 5 star acting.
To enjoy this movie, get a wine in your hand, close the curtains, turn of ur cellphones and put do not disturb sign on ur door. Best Dark thriller suspense movie you will get to experience."
"I have just watched the Joker in Venice and I will say if Joaquin doesn't get an Oscar this year then something is wrong with this world. This perfomance is just jaw-dropping, it glues you to the screen and doesn't let go till the end. Story is very good and has some interesting connections with Batman lore(especially one you can't guess from trailers). There are some scenes that are so tense ,well-acted and imaginative that push this movie to 10. Cinematography and direction are great, Todd has proven himself as a director. Robert is also good in his ""small"" role. Will definitely see it again as soon as it out in October."
"The acting, cinematography, sound design, and the script itself is phenomenal. This movie is a triumph. Joaquin Pheonix deserves an Oscar win for this tbh."
"This movie causes the audience to consider many topics on morality, particularly the poor choices made by the Joker. The Joker is more relatable in this movie than antagonists usually are. I think this gives a more realistic view of ""bad"" people, who are not usually 100% bad in all ways as society often judges. It is important to know when to sympathize with the Joker (towards the beginning of the movie), and when he needs to be identified as a threat (when he begins making certain bad choices). This movie is only suitable for adults who are willing to pick it apart and think critically about it. It isn't for light amusement. That substance is what makes it so good.If you aren't able to ponder underlying themes on your own, and you have to be handed all your thoughts to you, then this isn't the best movie for you."
"I quit relying on critic reviews years ago... I noticed for this movie that the critics ratings were low but viewer ratings were high. That being said, what is the point of a critic when for this movie, they are oh so wrong.
I went and saw this tonite with my mom. I went in skeptical and w some what low expectations. I knew not to expect your typical super hero movie.
What we got was a masterpiece. I went in expecting sheer boredom and I was instead on the edge of my seat the whole time. Not action edge of your seat, it was a fear of what he may do or say next edge of your seat. To see this character evolve into what we all know as the #1 villain of Batman was beyond genius and Joaquin Phoenix is a true master at perfecting the art of consuming himself into this character. I may be all over the place with this but I don't care. This movie, the story, the acting, directing, effects, everyone brought their A game and JP definitely deserves a nod and win for this role. And no, there is no comparison here to Jack Nicholson or Heath Ledger. Each actor took on this character and different levels, different story points and different points in time, so any comparison would just not be feasible or fair to any of the actors as they embraced him and made him come to life in their own genius way!"
"The movie affects you in a way that makes it physically painful to experience, but in a good way."
I will stop watching movies if Joaquin Phoenix is not awarded Oscar for his tremendous acting.
This was amazing. DC needs to stick with the serious and more realistic stuff. I haven't seen a DC movie this good since the Nolan Dark Knight films. This was a surprising place to find a realistic take on mental health issues and I was not expecting to ever feel bad for the Joker. The fact that some of the media doesn't get this movie is kinda ironic isn't it? It's almost like they want something negative to occur so they can blame it on the movie instead of looking in the mirror.
"Need I say more? Everything about this Movie is Masterful in every single way! Joker isn't just an awesome comic book movie, it's an awesome movie, period. It offers no easy answers to the unsettling questions it raises about a cruel society in decline. Joaquin Phoenix's fully committed performance and Todd Phillips' masterful albeit loose reinvention of the DC source material make Joker a film that should leave comic book fans and non-fans alike disturbed and moved in all the right ways."
"Joaquin' portrayal of a sociopathic, mentally unstable man's transformation to the iconic Joker was non other than a grippingly accurate, realistic and touching rendition. A dark and disturbing character piece led by an Oscar worthy performance by Joaquin Phoenix. You really do feel bad for this guy, which makes it all the more heartbreaking when he inevitably becomes the clown prince of crime we all know and love, although we've never seen him like this. We see him suffer throughout the movie to the point we're almost rooting for himk to become a mass murdering psyco clown, because that at least will make feel better; then it happens and we just wish this could have all just been avoided, because es so messed up. We feel for him and care about him. By the time he's the joker, we wish we could've helped him. There's a lot of great nods to the greater Batman universe, yet the movie is a self contained character piece. That can only be the mark of a great movie. All the acting is great, the plot (while similar to Taxi Driver) is brilliant and the quality of the movie shows you don't need CGI super powers to be a great villain in a Superhero movie. Is a joke not everyone gets. This movie is ""the rise of the Joker!"" 10/10"
"Joaquin Phoenix IS the joker. Phoenix gave a performance that felt like a mixture of Heath Ledger's joker, Jack Nicholson's joker, and Alex in A Clockwork Orange:Overall, this movie was a trip to say the least. Cinematography was very good, and the soundtrack set the perfect mood for the film for the most part. The acting and plot are what sold it though. Phoenix made me forget that the character was one I had seen before in other movies. His performance mixed with the overall feel and plot of the movie made me leave the theater feeling like I too had just taken a descent into madness.I've never been a very big fan of superhero movies so I was a little weary going into the movie, but this had absolutely nothing to do with anything superhero related other than the characters. I loved this movie and will definitely see it again. It was just what I hoped it would be."
"Joaquin Phoenix gives Heath Ledger a run for his money, true story. This is not a popcorn fluff comic book flick. DO NOT TAKE YOUR KIDS TO SEE THIS MOVIE. Shut down all ballots for the Oscar, Joaquin is taking that one home hands down. One of the best origin stories EVER put out. The only downside to this movie, is that it is a stand alone film that will have no sequels or ties to the DC Universe. Todd Philips take on the Joker is one of pure brilliance and Joaquin Phoenix was the Joker we deserved. He didn't steal from Jack or Heath but yet you got a taste of both."
"The music. The intense. The realism. The performance. The story. Such a perfect combination of everything. I never felt that a character like joker could be real until I saw this. Phoenix shows us what a joker is in our society and shows us how power can be obtained. Philips on the other hand had the perfect choice of music, camera angles, lighting and every important factor. Overall, I did not expect the story to be this perfect. Too many shocking turns happened and it really does represent today's society. If I was in the first screening, I would have applauded for 80 min not 8."
"Saw Joker for the second time in a cinema to night, and I was still both entertained and amazed over this masterpiece......One of the best films for many years and just might the best performance by a leading actor since Taxidriver and still maybe even better....Joaquin must win the Oscar for that performance.... I was blown away by his portrail of Joker.Go see it for the first, second or maybe eight time👍😊"
"Phoenix convinces me that he has always meant to be the joker. The movie went beyond my expectations, so many emotions went through me these couple hours. I think because its rated R, Phoenix was able to unlock jokers full psychotic potential as the character he is meant to be. This was an AMAZING story, and it calls for more. And I mean a build up, a second movie, maybe one with batman? My hopes are too high at this point, but nevertheless, brilliant goddamn movie and THE BEST joker ever played hands down."
"The perfect portrait of a decline to insanity""
& Joaquin Phoenix portrays this flawlessly in a performance of a lifetime.
Choreographed impeccably by Todd Phillips & is nothing short of breathtaking.
The cinematography & backdrop ideology of such an original film for such a complex character is only complimented by the superb soundtrack & acting. A hauntingly beautiful film & A Definate 10/10.
Edit: Bring on part 2 plssssss!. We all want it!."
"There is no doubt that the movie was well thought of - from the plot to execution. I must praise Phoenix's superb acting. He managed to portray very believably the awkward social reject and also the crazy murderer that he became. I really think it's a role only few could do. It was also very interesting to watch how he deteriorated mentally and little by little gave up on trying to fit into society. Gotta hand it to the script writer - the plot was unpredictable.But...There wasn't anything too complex about Arthur's mental state. No deep psychological analysis, or a web of many deep factors that created a one of a kind psychotic maniac. Could it be that I was expecting too much? Very possible since I came with very high expectations after reading some reviews.
What doesn't have anything with expectations is that at the end he didn't remind much of the original Joker. He felt more like a simply society reject that went completely crazy and started killing people. Not that much different from many other serial killers or mass murderers. He didn't have the master mind that so much designated the Joker and made him different from a simple murderer.
Another thing is that there were long parts of the movie that felt very dull.
Also I found it hard to buy the reason behind the riots in the city and the role the Joker played in them. Even if taken into account that the poverty and anger was cooking for a long time in that society, it still feels somewhat absurd that killing three people in the subway made the joker so notorious.
In conclusion, I can identify with the character which gave me a lasting impression of the movie, and this movie could have been very great if it was a movie about how a person that's rejected by society turns slowly into a serial killer. But as a movie about the Joker I felt it was lacking. Lacking the things that made the Joker actually the Joker, and not just another crazy murderer."
"Phoneix is so complete in his portrayal of a man's irrevocable decline into insanity that Joker and Batman story line becomes merely incidental to entire narrative. Phoenix steals the show in every scene he's in and he's in every scene. He manages to create that balance between insanity (which Leto overshot) and philosophy (Which Heath Ledger nailed) whilst also giving his character a really retro vibe.The gritty and grimy hyper-realism of Gotham subverts the comic genre and makes it a movie focused on telling it's own story. If I had to compare Joker to any other movie probably it will be Taxi Driver or One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest. But, honestly speaking, the added layer of the Joker's nihilism and the complete lack of actual superheroes add a whole other level. In all honesty It is a cinematic experience that generates a lot of empathy and provokes a lot of thought."
"The pool does not need the money. They need the dignity and respect, coz that is what it takes to be a human. If you don't have that, money will only be a reminder of them being a ""good boy"". Like some politicians, they feel so frustrated when people from the lower class does not accept their funding champions. In this movie, through joker's life, I begin to get it."
"In an era of cinema so saturated with superheroes and gritty remakes, Todd Phillips and Phoenix somehow take a character so deeply intrenched in pop culture and create something compelling and unique. This film is unafraid to be bleak and scary without offering much to the viewer as a means of comfort. The only way we can deal with the harsh cruelties of the world is by treating it as a joke. Upon leaving this movie, you will not hate Joker, you will hate the world that made him.Phoenix simply cannot be praised enough. He brings both sympathy and tragedy in the way he moves his eyes, the way he contorts his shoulders, the way he laughs. A lesser actor would be unable to swing his moods from as far extremes as Phoenix does nor add the layers that Phoenix intricately builds for his character. The way he twists and writhes his body is mesmerizing and brings even more tragedy to the Joker. This is Phoenix's movie.As for the technical side, this movie is far different than any other super hero films of recent years. The cinematographer and director choose a shallow focus, giving Pheonix a) the undivided attention of the viewer and b) a more personal feel to the film. There are wide shots with deep focus, but they are used sparingly because this movie is about a character, not action or explosions. The color palette of this movie is intentionally composed of dour greens, blues and tepid yellows--- all of which gives the world a sickly feel. The soundtrack is used affectively, bringing waves of optimism to intentionally clash with our protagonist's angry depression. This film will likely be compared to The Dark Knight and DCEU films, which I don't find to be fair. This film is far more akin to The Machinist and The King of Comedy in tone and visual style.I recommend this film, and I think anything short of an Oscar nomination for Phoenix would be disrespectful to the effort he gives. However, I have one gripe I would like to voice. I found the tie-ins to the Wayne family to be unnecessary. It came across as pandering to an audience that loves Easter eggs more-so than the story itself. In my opinion, I think the story would have worked even better if it had distanced itself from the Batman story. Other than that, I had little issue with the rest of the film.Joker is a movie that tells us life is full of sadness, and then gives us a character whose purpose is to spread laughter and joy. I was going to finish this review with a joke, but, you wouldn't get it."
"While the trailers for this movie have may seemed like there was potential for an action packed movie, this movie, clearly before it came to theaters was intended to be a progressive character study. You shouldn't go into this movie expecting intense action or the joker we know of the past. This is a movie about how Arthur Fleck becomes the Joker.I have seen so many bad reviews about how boring or slow the movie is, but I believe it was utter perfection. The first part of the movie we begin to understand Arthur as a person. All of his interactions with everyone in his life, be it good or bad. The whole point of a character study is evolution. And this is far and away one of the greatest evolutions of a character I have ever seen in a movie.Joaquin Phoenix's performance is by far the best acting I have seen in a movie possibly in the last few decades. We see a challenged person be challenged by society and it completely breaks him down over time. And Joaquin isn't acting, he is evolving all throughout the movie. If anyone thinks he doesn't put on an Oscar winning performance, they're out of their effing mind. Yes, the movie is slow to start, but it has to be. We couldn't just jump into the joker and all the chaos. We need to know where it came from to begin with.The whole compilation of the movie is amazing. The complete Oscar deserving performance of Joaquin, the choreography, the cinematography, the score. Everything is in perfect harmony. While there may have been a lot of controversy surrounding this movie, the team put together a perfect movie and I pity those who can't appreciate the tears and sweat and emotion that went into making this movie.I have always been so one sided in my movie preferences between Marvel and DC. I feel like Marvel is sooo much better overall and most movies DC puts out are trash. But Joker is far and away my favorite comic movie. Even though it takes a completely different spin on comic movies. You have to appreciate the evolution to appreciate this movie. It's not an action movie, but it's really rips and tears at all the emotions in one movie while adding a wild suspenseful kick. No other comic book movie has done that before."
"Joker is directed by Todd Philips and stars Joaquin Phoenix as Arthur Fleck, a man disregarded and thrown out of society.We live in an era in which formulaic comic book movies are more and more common. Joker not only proves that you can make a comic book movie without a villain but also proves that comic book movies can be used as psychological studies reflecting on how our society views and treats mental health issues of certain individuals.If I had to describe Joaquin Phoenix as the Joker in one word it would be mesmerising. His take on the iconic comic book character is filled with emotional depth to the point where it's almost painful to watch and flawlessly realistic making it one of the best performances of the decade.The cinematography is also something to note. It is full of gorgeous shots with a beautiful colour palate making it's shot composition and structure heavily differ from most comic book films.The score is very minimalistic but every time it comes on it feels unsettling and haunting which adds to the suspense of the story.My biggest and only issue with Joker is that it's too inspired by Scorsese's King of Comedy and Taxi Driver making the majority of the film predictable. However, making it predictable didn't take away much from its quality and only made it more unsettling because we can see the degradation of Joker's mind before it happens making the film more depressing.I wouldn't really call Joker a comic book movie. Yes, it's based on a comic book and depicts arguably the most iconic comic book character of all time, but it stands alone among dozens of its predecessors as a psychological drama that reflects on society and its issues rather than a fantasy world.Overall, Joker is a brilliant take on the character, however it's not for the faint of heart or narrow-minded and prejudiced people.Final Grade - 9/10"
"Still days after seeing it, I'm still stunned by this film. I was lucky enough to see this film at the night of August 31 at the 76th Venice International Film Festival with high anticipations, and I was blown away. Joaquin Phoenix's performance as the Joker was hands down the best of the entire year. His performance reminds me why we love to watch actors play other people, why performance is such an appreciated art form. His laugh, his movements and his slow transformation from Arthur Fleck, a wannabe stand up comedian to the crazy prince of thieves, the Joker, was a thing of beauty to watch. Anybody who's watching this film has to appreciate how Phoenix committed himself to this role, you don't see Phoenix on the screen, but the character of Joker. Joaquin Phoenix might has not topped Heath Ledgers Joker in my opinion, but damn was he close and he deserves every acting award possible.
The film offers a dark look of 1970s Gotham City; a dark, griddy atmosphere where there is no joy nor happiness in this world, and in many moments, the movie gave me instant ""Taxi Driver"" and ""King of Comedy"" vibes - two of Martin Scorsese's best films - without copying both films, but includes elements from both films like e.g. all the political tensions in the city are definitely borrowed from ""Taxi Driver"" and all the bits with the stand-up comedy from ""The King of Comedy"".
The film was a deep character study of a man with some psychological and health issues who simply wants to bring laughter to this world by performing as a clown in e.g. child's hospitals and performing as a stand-up comedian. But his mental health and this broken, sad, depressive society that doesn't know any joy, do not let him be the way he is and all the people around him see him as too weird/different and simply want to put him down; in the streets, in his workplace, at his mother's house etc. to the point where he simply finds a breaking point and loses his mind every day that goes by, which leads him to kill people and then become a symbol of terror and chaos towards the end. And at every moment something bad happens to Arthur Fleck - and yes, a whole lot of things happens in his life aka. to him throughout the film - you just feel sad for him, you mourn for him since he never seemed to have any intentions of harming people at first so that the audience exactly understands the things he does throughout the film. I'm not gonna go any further into plot details since the film's not yet out and I believe - even if it wouldn't have the name ""Joker"" in the title - that everybody should go and watch this film because we don't get such deep sophisticated character study films like this everyday - especially if such films gets mainstream attention. I enjoyed every second watching this character slowly falling apart.
Although I do think that the character of Zazie Beetz was totally useless and lead to nowhere, could have been easily cut out. That's probably my only negative with this film.
But still; it's a thought provoking masterpiece that has a lot to say - about the current situation of society -beyond being just a comic book movie. It offers a completely different take on the character of the Joker with some similarities to ""The Killing Joke"" with lots of surprising twists (one word: Wayne) that even connects it with the Batman comics and will leave you speechless. And half the greatness of this film is thanks to the great performance of Phoenix!
I'm gonna say this: the scene in the third act where the Joker appears live on TV at the Murray Franklin show - which was shown in the final trailer - blew me personally away, the tensions, the build up, Phoenix's greatness and even Robert De Niro's acting, was a heartbeat moment to me. Not spoiling it, but it's amazing. I can't wait to rewatch it when it comes out in October...Check it out as soon as it comes out! #Venice76"
"10/10 Amazing story, Brilliant taking, magnificent cinematography.
Someone had to step out of the safe game played by Superhero movies and Joker movie does just that (also The Boys). Movie is gritty, real, insanely dark and sometime quite disturbing to people who don't want accept what's shown in the movie is a terrible reality we face everyday if refused a proper care.
Normally people start to compare the movie with one of the greatest like The Dark Knight and in acting wise to that of Heath ledger's Potrayal of joker.
I wouldn't say this movie is better that that or otherwise , but it will stand tall amongst the greatest like The Godfather, Taxi Driver, Citizen Kane, The Dark Knight.
Coming to the inevitable comparison of who's the better Joker? Heath or Joaquin. The answer is Both did a phenomenal job and the Joker character itself is fortunate to have being played by two greatest actors.
Definitely a top contender for Oscars. I personally think it would take away
1.Best Actor 2.Cinematography 3.Original score and if Once Upon a time in Hollywood loses in Make-up and hairstyling category it would definitely be to The Joker."
"DC can STILL give us a compelling movie. Wasn't quite hyped about it, I mean, an origin story of a villain made by the director of Hangover movies; what could I even expect? Then, the reviews started to drop. Still wasn't sure if I would like it. And after I saw it, it was way better than I thought it would be. I won't call it a masterpiece, but it definitely is on my top 3 DC films of all times!Good : There's hardly anything bad about Joker. Joaquin Phoenix does a great job of bringing the character into life. Rather than a typical superhero/supervillain origin story, we get to see a psychological drama + horror, and thank God, we got that. I love the genre, I love films like Infinity War, Days of Future Past, Endgame and Raimi's Spider-Man. But occasionally, it's really good to take a break from such films. It's, kind of, in the category of films like Unbreakable. Basically, the movie is (no spoilers ahead) Arthur, being tormented by the society and being a mentally unstable loner, loses his mind after the constant torment and after that, all hell breaks loose. That's all the movie shows. It would be quite difficult to give a really good story for a plot like this, since there are many movies with this kind of plot (awfully crappy ones included). I completely liked this movie, means the screenplay and direction worked for me. You can feel for Arthur, whenever the movie asks you to. You want to root for Arthur, but you know that it will mean some incredibly terrible things will happen. We see him slowly transition into Joker, and when he completely turns into the Joker it is worth a round of applause. We feel good as well as terrified with the actions of the Joker whenever he snaps and crazy stuff happens. Without getting into spoilers, I would say - in short - that it has many quotable lines and each of them make sense. Whatever Joker (a psychopath) says is more realistic than what a sane person says. And obviously has some sick, terrifying and gruesome Joker moments that a proper Joker movie should have. If it's not clear by the trailers, there's no Batman here. But (again, no spoilers) it does have some Batman references to support the movie. It could've created a mess and might have felt like a shoehorned plotline, but it plays out as a proper support for the main story and the transition of Arthur into Joker.Mixed : It is a good thing that the movie has a 70s psycho horror vibe to it. But, it could've been more original. Like many others have pointed out, it's similar to Taxi Driver by Scorsese. While it wasn't a copy and paste of Taxi Driver, but some parts make it obvious that the movie was inspired by Taxi Driver. Not necessarily a bad thing, the movie has the elements as a homage-ish way, but looking at how well made it was, it could've been slightly more original. And, it may feel a bit slow for some people, though it's worth your time.My take on the controversy : It can happen that some morons might watch this film and cause violence. It can happen with any violent movie. But, even though it justified the Joker's actions, it doesn't show them to be right. Speaking of violence, it's just psychologically compelling horror. It's less violent than Deadpool, but feels more violent as it's a serious movie. So, glorification and siding with a psychopath is a complete and total nonsense.Conclusion : It's a must watch. You don't need to follow any of the DC movies to understand it. But do not expect it to be a typical superhero action film with CGI battles and a spectacle. Wrong expectations might ruin the experience. Else, I found it to be better than The Dark Knight Rises. And TDKR is one of my favorites in the genre. If a Nolan movie is replaced by another movie in my list, you may consider it to be great. One last thing, people causing violence because of Joker would be equivalent to The Good, The Bad and The Ugly inspiring three people to have a gun duel for some gold.Rating:Score : 10/10Grade : A+"
"Seriously, unbelievable. Dare I say better than Heath Ledger? If Joaquin Phoenix doesn't win the Oscar for best actor and 'Joker' doesn't win at the VERY least, best screenplay, it will be one of the biggest Oscar snubs of our time"
I read reviews before watching the film and was not disappointed! Joquain's performance..... the cinematography..... the fact that it was relatable in regards to mental illness.... it was all-consuming and I was enthralled the entire time! I'll be going back to see this again in the next few days and I NEVER do that!
"I thought this film was good but I just don't get the hype personally. The acting was amazing and the film was good overall but I think 'masterpiece' and 'film of the year' are a bit overused throughout the reviews. In no way did I dislike this film, I thought it was really good, just overhyped. I feel as though a lot of the 10/10 reviews are purely based on the fact that it already has amazing reviews and so people want to carry the praise further and that it is about the joker. If this film was released and was about some random guy in the same situation, I don't think the reviews would be as high but maybe that's the point."
"This movie is a masterpiece! It absolutely epitomizes what a DC movie should be. Dark, emotional, thought provoking, not just action action action. One of the best movies I've seen in a long time.Critics have definitely lost touch with the public and should be ignored on this one. Do yourself a favor and watch it!And remember to be good to one another. You dont know what someone else is going through."
"What an incredible ride this was. I was almost motionless throughout, watching in awe the performance of a lifetime - the transition from troubled man to monster, the hounding score which directly drove the goosebumps, the cinematography which made you feel like you were flying through Gotham looking for Arthur yourself and the masterful De Niro who gave his nod to Jerry Lewis. Ignore DC. Ignore Batman. This is a work of art in its own right."
"One of the best movies in these few years and 100% Oscar worthy
Joaquin Phoenix delivers one of the best performances I've ever scene"
"The movie was excellent and amazing, from the beginning that Joaquin's personality is seen as he evolves in the Joker until the end, Joker is the most difficult character to do and I think Joaquin did it!!"
"Please go watch this movie! This is the first time I've ever wrote a review on this app and I've been using it to read reviews for years! That's how good this film is. Very dark, grimy and disturbing, exactly how an origin film about the joker should be. I have no doubt it will win multiple oscars. Do yourself a favor and go see it!!!"
"Joker is literally an achievement in cinematic history there's no doubt in that ! But why people comparing it with Endgame ? Both movies have their own ways and they are completely different. Endgame was the best at its genre. Talking about Joker ... What can I say ... A beautiful presentation of storyline , direction , screenplay was all at its peak of greatness ... Heath ledger smiling down to earth :)"
"W.O.W!!!
What can I say about how brilliant Phoenix act performance is ??
In shortcut,movie of the year 💯/💯👏"
"When I heard everyone saying that this is the film of the year and all the reviews flooding in with 10's, I was quite hyped and excited for this movie. When I walked out of the cinema, I felt hollow and empty.Before I continue writing, let me say this, This is NOT the film of the year nor is it a real masterpiece. The cinematography is excellent and the acting is incredible, that's just it. The side-characters are bland and overly dramatic. The plot heavily relies on plot-twists and the film is so harsh that it actually falls flat on it's face.Are there no good points though? Phoenix is phenomenal and the score is great. The cinematography is also incredible but the plot is not that great at all. It even has plot holes and scenes that left me empty.Film of the year? Nope."
"Joker is without a doubt my new favorite DC film. It's dark and gritty but with enough psychological twists that it keeps you guessing from beginning to end. Nothing can be taken at face value and the film forces you to think from beginning to end. Don't listen to the critics, this one is worth watching multiple times in theaters."
The ending is what matters in a movie. And this movie has a kind of ending which would leave many speechless. It's indeed a masterpiece:)
"I went into this film expecting an all-time classic based on the reviews I had read & what I ended up watching was just a decent film overall. Phoenix is outstanding...so he definitely did his part. But I feel like if you've seen the trailers you've seen the movie because the best way I can describe this film is it feels like a 2 hour version of the trailer. At 2 hours it's a relatively common runtime, but it felt a lot longer...which isn't good. I'd say this is much more of a rental than a theater movie. Kinda just....eh."
"I am not a Batman fan nor am I particularly fond of Joaquin Phoenix, but this movie was truly exceptional. It started slow but built to a viscerally satisfying crescendo. I never thought I would be rooting for the Joker, but found that I did so throughout the movie. The Joker's pain was so palpable. I am filling out my Oscar pool card right now.PS This movie is dark and violent and decidedly not a super hero movie. Leave the kids at home."
Creative actor Joaquin creativity embodied the role of the Joker film deserves more than 10
"Yesterday was that day, when I understand, that I have touched history. This movie will drag you in your deepest thoughts, in your darkest secrets and suffering. This masterpiece will grind you, like a meat grinder and you will watch it in silence and with open mouth. Like the whole cinema will.
I don't like comics movie, marvel is very pompous, absurd and insipid. In my opinion. It's not an art, it's just an attraction. As DC movies was too. But now DC made history, the made art and made drama.
To be more understandable. When you watch for example Avengers or League of Justice you are eating McDonald's hamburger. But when you watch Joker you are eating 1000$ stake in the most luxurious restaurant in the world."
"I was so hyped up to see this movie, loved the trailer, only movie I have wanted to watch in the cinema for a very long time.I watched it and was bored. the astectics were amazing, music was good, story and execution was meh. the performence of the joker was a good performence but people raving about this are driving me mad. either you have not seen many movies or I have seen too many. this movie was bang average and was actually boring. I was thinking about leaving half way through as I was bored out of my mind.I do not regret watching it but it is being so overhyped that I am so confused right now. I think it had a good premise but could have been so much more, so much more.Signs of a great movie is the repeat viewing of it or it moving you, did not move me whatsoever and I would not watch it again.I thought maybe people are getting paid to write good review but have actually met people who think it is the best movie ever.... OMGGGThis movie is bang average and way overhyped.
phenoix performence is good but as the story and execution is so bad, I feel he never even touched the higher spectrums of performence.I have experienced and seen worse in my life, if this made you feel, you are (i hate this word but have to use it) a snowflake. Please get off social media and live life.there is a real world out there."
"This movie can makes you feel the bitterness, the sadness, the whole psychopathic transition
A perfect impact
You would definitely after this movie understand the Joker
Good music
good directed
Amazing actor :Joaquin phoenix
The best character development i ever seen"
Beautifully acted and beautiful story.Refreshing to watch compared to most films in 2019.
"The Joker (Arthur Fleck) endures hardship and ridicule in the most destructive manner possible whilst carrying various conditions that mount on top of his already broken mental state. Uncovering truths about his past and uncovering the real person behind the characters he admired.Although his way of punishing those that hurt him was at the very least psychotic, his beliefs were clear. Nothing in the system was stopping the city's everyday dilemmas it faced and Arthur knew he had to somehow get the message out despite the monumental issues he had personally. Arthur tried to be someone that would bring happiness in-spite of his own poverty-ridden life. Unfortunately, his conditions made the stage that he thought would benefit him, transform into a 'joke' aimed towards him which has catastrophic consequences in his life, and the 'normal people' in Gotham city.From the perspective of the Joker (Arthur), we can see why he acts the way he does. He acts that way because it seems he cannot escape the world he lives in. Gotham cages Arthur into a maniacal state of mind and forces Arthur to expose what he finds that is wrong with 'the people' around him.Arthur embraces his conditions, abnormal and psychotic mindset despite what effect it has had on his life. As the 'clown people' get behind him, Arthur becomes accepted. He is no longer alone. He carries what is 'right' for the people and refuses to recant his beliefs to tell his story.He thinks that the way people think is corrupt and that he is the result of that and unfortunately the victim of a 'bad joke'.Opinion: The film takes the unconventional method of exploring dark themes and in some cases, grips the audience in a roller-coaster ride of the devastation of mental illness' and hardships in poverty-stricken people's lives.By exploring those themes, we are given a rough picture of what it is like when you've really hit the low point. The film doesn't hold back in going into deep meaningful plot developments about the expectations of how 'we should behave' and how the Joker is the perfect example of someone in desperate need of help and affection.The Joker is a film that is a must watch to end the decade of the 2010s.A chilling way to introduce the Joker and I think Heath Ledger would be proud."
"I don't write many reviews but clearly this movie is worth seeing. What a great performance, I really push all film-lover to go and watch this movie."
"Here, we have a broken man whose mental instability and illness is the catalyst for what Arthur Fleck eventually becomes, but I mean nowhere in this movie do we witness any kind of intellectual prowess, high intelligence, or even any miniscule reference to his wit and smarts to believe he has what it takes to become the Joker from the previous films.Also, there is merit to the theory that the whole entire movie was a dream playing out in his imagination, and he was conveying that to the psychiatrist the whole movie, which connects to the end since it starts with him meeting a psychiatrist and we know he was making things up by the revelations. In addition, there is no factuality to the idea that he was Thomas Wayne's lovechild. Joker is having a delusion of grandiose throughout the story, connecting himself to powerful people and situations, which would be a semi-trait of his narcissism, as well (although narcissism is far from his predominant psychological problems). I'd prefer this theory because it would explain why Fleck lacked any kind of pragmatism and intelligence we've come to expect throughout this movie.The Joker is playing the psychotherapist the whole time, making her feel sympathy and bad for him (as well as the audience), and that's the joke on her at the end, which enables him to kill her, too. This is Joker's own fantasy origin story, which has little validity.Go ahead and downvote, but there's no way this take on the Joker is intelligent and mentally competent enough to become Ledger's Joker."
"I saw the movie after the opening weekend and loved it. I think it's a masterpiece. Convinced my 65 year old mother too see it, who couldn't even remember whose nemesis the Joker is. She had read about all the negative press about the movie being too violent and taking light of mental health issues.She loved the movie. Sympathized for Arthur and was rooting for the Joker (to a certain point) She was surprised about the small amount of violence is depicted after all the press putdown and enjoyed the ""social commentary"" the movie conveys.Her score: 9 / 10Mom is always right."
Best acting and story. This is an Oscar winning movie
"The reality, far from fiction!! That what's made the movie,,, the oscar winner actor made a new joker rivalry with heath ledger joker, better joker in some people opinion.. piece of art"
"Wow, what a movie! I have to admit, When I first heard Joaquin Phoenix was going to be the joker, I was surprised. I wasn't sure how he was going to pull it off. I was hoping it wasn't going to be another cheesy rendition full of fluff and unrealistic explanations of how the Joker came to be. One where my (adult) son wouldn't have to keep nudging me to wake me up. I was pleasantly surprised on well Todd Phillips' version played and Joaquin's acting was superb. You could feel the anguish his character was going through right up to the point he lost his mind. Just an excellent, well acted movie that you almost forget is derived from a DC comic."
"Wow I honestly gotta tell you, it's one of the best movies I've seen in years. All from the cinematography, thumping and sadden soundtrack, all the way to the OMG performance by Joaquin Phoenix, it's dark, it's evolving, twisting and wow just you can feel deep down to your bones his emotions portraying the Joker.Just alone watching hearing The Jokers laugh is so twisty and evil and you could hear his sadness coming out from his mouth. You could hear the hours of practice just on the laugh alone and his method acting is perfectly on point along with his subtle gestures and dance that is done perfectly as the Joker should be. This movie has all the psychological twisting that made you believed and immersed into the movie, I was totally shocked and overwhelmed by everything even after I left the cinema. Just mind-blowned.When I was watching in just now in the cinema, more than half the cinema cheered and applauded on certain scenes. And almost the entire patron stayed until the last credit. If u looked closely even Joker costume were evolving and changing from time to time based on his journey and experienced and just looked at the final and true form just looked absolutely stunning. Just the excitement and the dialogues told by The Joker is just so heart-crushing and it just made me felt so bad for the Joker, and it's the first time where I sided with the evil character or maybe he is the hero of this movie, who knows ?Honestly, u have to watch it, it's one of the best performance u be watching in a Long time, movies like this deserves to be watched on the Big Screen, go find the best cinema in town and enjoy the wild ride of emotions and fear and anger, just satisfying!!"
"The reviews here are making this film out to be far better than it actually is. Don't get me wrong, technically, it is extremely well done and Phoenix's performance is really quite extraordinary (he is definitely looking at an Oscar nomination), but despite excellent writing, acting and direction........the film is kinda boring.It had its moments, and, sure, it has some very disturbing elements but....If I had a watch, I would have looked at it many times as what this film lacks is...excitement.The final act is most excellent, but it felt like it took forever to get to it."
JOKER is a gift to the audiences. I felt as a privileged person to sit in a movie theater and watching it. Joaquin Phoenix and Todd Phillips gave to the world of cinema a rear pearl. I don't know what people are complaining about: this is really something else.
"Dark, depressing and unsettling film with a haunting score. Incredible acting, directing and screenplay. Joaquin killed it. 5 out of 5 stars! Mental health is so important guys!!!"
"I was expecting a masterpiece and oscar worthy film from all the hype.
I actually didn't enjoy watching this movie.
there was no message, it was slow and the joker turned out just to be the son of a schizophrenic and went crazy over a slight amount of bullying. I don't see how anyone could relate to this character and the laughing is lame acting way overdone.
I'm just stunned that this has a 9/10 rating right now, how the hell?"
"I can't believe that such a totally perfect and spectacular movie I just saw, I am completely stunned. This movie needs to be in the Oscars. Nominated to:This film must be nominated for the following awards:
Best movie
best Actor
Best screenplay
Best address
Best Adapted Screenplay
Best soundtrack
Best sound mixing"
No one cares about your country's inability to separate Reel and Real influences. Film is a medium not just for political ideals or comments.Watch it
What a legendary character and what a legendary performance by the actor. I was not able to move on from the Heath ledger performance but this movie is totally worth it. This movie deserves an oscar. It showcased the never before seen origin of The Joker himself and you will love it.
"BREAKING NEWS: Killer clowns are back! But this time they're not pranksters mimicking Pennywise to scare the sh*t out of people for viral memes; they're ""incels"" threatening to gun down everyone who chooses to take their date to this dour, depressing, demented movie.If this Joker were the one featured in Nolan's marvelously entertaining Dark Knight, I doubt any of your skinny lonely drugged-up psychos would be rushing to hail this guy as his hero and inspiration.Ledger's Joker is brilliant, manipulaitve, and consumed with an infectious, and sometimes charming, confidence. Phoenix's Joker is dumb, depressing, and insecure. Ledger makes things happen. Things happen to Phoenix. The Joker controls events in Dark Knight. Events spiral out of control in Joker.There is no fun in this movie, no great action set pieces, no hint of hope or optimism. It's a two hour slog of watching a miserable man drive himself insane until he starts murdering people. Then seemingly everyone goes insane because ""they've had enough!""Change the name of this movie to Arthur, eliminate the very few references to the Batman universe, and I doubt you'd think this was an origin story to the Joker we all know and love. Maybe this Joker is the closest to what the Joker would resemble in the real world...which is perhaps why this movie is so awful. Who wants that movie?There are plenty of good character-driven films of mentally disturbed individuals who spiral out of control. There are plenty of good dark gritty super hero movies. This is neither of them."
"The performance of Joaquin is excellent but the story simply don't have anything to do with the Joker, it's more about a mentaly ill man struggling with his chaotic enviroment until it's overwhelmed and snaps. I would be a much better film if the title was ""Arthur"" or ""The Clown"" but the fact that it's forced to be related to the batman universe it's why i feld it didn't work."
"I am a simple guy. I watch films, I enjoy life's simple pleasures.One thing I despise doing in life (because it feels pointless) is being far too judgemental or complex as I watch a film that is portraying a message or story in its own way.Will I compare Rambo to Ace Ventura? No. Will I compare Saving Private Ryan to Endgame? No. I watch each film individually and if it completes its own mission of what it wanted to deliver, then I'm a happy bunny. I will not let life's current politics, or the sensitivity of the pathetic world's expectations to override a successful STORY. For me, a story is the most important part of a film personally.With that being said... JOKER is a successful STORY. In fact, I will call it a masterpiece because of how it delivers the realistic, sympathetic character build ups of one of the most popular villains in the history of time and space.And one of the main reasons I became attached and cared for the character was because of PHOENIX. What a fantastic actor. He nailed it. That is all I need to say. I absolutely loved the Dark Knight Trilogy and Heath Ledger's Joker... But where Ledger successfully gave us a realistic Joker for the first time, PHOENIX has now taken that championship with respect. PHOENIX has now given us the same in his own way, with a deeper and more engrossing background. Additionally, with an outstanding Joker performance (the dancing and laughing)... Absolutely spot on.The mystery of the Joker is still retained in this movie... And even though its an ""Origins"" story... I still feel like The Joker is a complete mystery.PHOENIX is in almost every scene, and its because of him and his execution and commitment to the role which makes this movie a standalone masterpiece. And it brings the respect back to The Joker character after that terrible representation of... What's his name again?If you want a super hero movie, this movie is not that movie. Joker's mission as a movie is to take the audience on a crazy trip inside the mind of the Joker... Its not about cinematics... Or explosions... Or gadgets... Or casting... It's about ""Why?""And now I see ""Why?""So now ask yourself... ""Why so serious?"""
"What's the most important thing that connect a character with the public? A deep, psycological interior drama. That's what brings this cinecomic upper from others similar movie. Joker is a protagonist that you'll never forget, I'll garantee you! More human and less fictional character: it could be a story of a normal man that try to survive in this mad world where there's no right or wrong and the real normality is to be mad, it's a Pirandellian concept in a way but that's the main theme. Even Gotham and the people who live in are seen in a new, dark, cynical and more actual than ever view. An origin movie that you'll never expect. I don't spend a single word talking about how perfect is every technical aspect because probably you know yet and of course, Joaquin Phoenix is a legend. Maybe the representation of Thomas Wayne could get a little bit angry the most passionate fans in a way but apart this, for me is 10/10.
I hope we'll talk about this in the future as a brother of The Dark Knight."
"To say it was satisfying would be somewhat misleading. Joaquin Phoenix makes you feel uncomfortable almost the entire time. I couldn't help thinking about Christian Bale in The Machinist and Robert De Niro in Taxi Driver. With those comparisons, clearly I have some high praise on the acting.The film itself slowly builds momentum, but when it builds...it's really builds. Those looking for traditional comic book action may feel it moves a bit slow, but it's pace allows for the transformation to not feel superficial. When you walk out of the theater you won't know exactly how to feel, but you'll surely want to know how everyone else feels about it."
"Acting, Cinematography, Music, Screenplay, Costumes, Gotham etc everything is 10/10.Oscar worthy performanceby by Joaquin Phoenix.Amazing directing by Todd Phillips & amazing cinematography by Lawrence Sher."
"Wow, it takes a while to find the right words to describe this movie. It's different! It feels like a character study, almost like a documentary but at the same time as if you'd be watching a horror drama movie as intense as it is and realistic.
It touches on mental health issues which sadly this country is struggling with but won't admit to it. This film has the best character development I could possibly think of! Now I will say this:
JOKER is the last movie you'd ever want to show to kids! Not even teenagers should see this! It might be a tough one for them to see as it is brutal, bloody and might even be simply too much to handle. I saw some walk out of the theater and if you're a very sensitive person you might do the same! However, it is by far the best film and performance of the year and there's no doubt Joaquin Phoenix should win all awards for this including the Oscar! And in my opinion while it is a different take on the JOKER, this is the best portrayal of the JOKER.
Go see this with an open mind, and if possibly without expectations. This will definitely spark many conversations and most likely arguments as well."
"Nothing short of what I expected. Hands down the best psychological drama ever made, as best as I recall seeing. I never thought that The Joker could be the hero, that would pretty much make everyone else the villains, but it does happen! He does it! Monumental performance by Joaquin Phoenix.Honestly I thought the script would be brilliant, but it's just about good enough, he makes it seem brilliant! Or maybe JP just embodies perfectly the vision of the screenplay writer, and they're both equally good! I've seen it in something akin HDrip and enjoyed every moment of this movie and I await the Blu Ray release so I can enjoy it again, in more detail!The only way you wouldn't like this movie is if you'd be too much of a child or too stupid for it, as it has the most substance a movie can have, by a fu*king continental drift from the lot! It may be my favorite movie ever, but I have to see it a few more times to be certain! I give it good chances though, I liked him before, but this is the 1st time I truly loved a Joker!"
"Joaquin Phoenix is a good actor but I think now he become a legend.
A nice movie with a great act of a great actor.
An unforgettable movie."
"I know this is an unpopular opinion, but honestly this movie is overrated and boring. 2 hours felt like 3 and a half.I don't buy the whole thing where he is invited to the show. The meta ""standup"" he made was extremely dull and boring. Then gets allowed to broadcast for that long without being interrupted, also being transported in the most shitty police-car ever after that, it's just not believeable enough to me.He also acted the same when he was on meds aswell as off, so that part didn't make sense either. The police must also be really not catching this guy faster after the homocide.It has some good parts but they can be boiled down to maybe 5 minutes.
Is this a movie I would watch again? Probably not."
"Without a doubt, Joker is in contention for the film of the year.With Joachin Phoenix garnering praise left and right for Joker it's easy to dismiss the multiple other elements of direction, sound mixing, editing, cinematography, set and costume design and casting that make this a truly astounding piece of artistic cinema.
Joker is a film that without any one of these elements, it would fail. It would slip into the same bracket as Suicide Squad and be forgotten, but, fail it certainly does not.Joachin Phoenix is phenomenal. We know this already from pictures like Her and The Master, what we didn't know was how utterly deep and broad his range was. At points, I was totally absorbed by Joker. For the first time in possibly 10 years the movie theatre melted away, along with other viewers and noises and I was a part of that film. It was as if I was watching a documentary, rather than a fictional work. His commitment to the role, his weight loss and mental strain are dangerous but it produces something that no one ever thought would happen. It produces a performance that could genuinely rival Heath Ledgers.Todd Phillips direction and script are masterstrokes. If it were a painting it would be a Turner, with bright violent skies, and dark sad landscapes. His beautiful melting pot of inspiration features large doses of Martin Scorsese's 'The King of Comedy' and 'Taxi Driver', alongside the physiological battery acid from more recent pictures such as Fight Club and Black Swan.
It swirls together to birth this bitter, gritty, dark, mesmerising masterpiece, that both requires and demands, multiple, in-depth viewings.For me, what makes this film is the costume design and the cinematography. The design of every minute detail on each character to make Gotham look even more drab and dull, even more grimy and beaten down is exceptional. Similar to how Scorsese made Harlem and The Bronx look broken and corrupted in Taxi Driver, you feel physically dirty after watching numerous sequences and you feel pangs of genuine social guilt stemming from your own moments of awful selfishness.
The cinematography is astounding, and MUST be in contention for an Academy Award, alongside Best Lead, Best Direction and best Sound Mixing. Some of the shots could have been lifted from a Time Magazine piece on 'City Life' they're that artistically powerful. Whole, dialogue-free sequences that say far more with silence and sounds of a city teetering on the brink of oblivion in the background than anyone could ever say. The sound mixing to have conversations, telephones, car horns, shouting, trains prevalent in the background audio leaking into the foreground does what Nolan did in 'Dunkirk' and pushes further the feeling of strain. The idea that even noise is seeping in from the city and soon the barricade will break and it'll drown us all in it's filth, corruption and decadence.Joker is a true masterpiece. So dark, so dirty, so vindictive of a modern flawed and broken societal system, but it always reminds you:
Put on a happy face."
"Absolute disappointment. I believed the hype like a fool. No person that actually saw it told me it was a good movie, just the stupid reviews. It's so cringe, with nothing actually happening except Phoenix smoking and dancing around. There is no action, no substance, no humor. Everything is so cringe and overacted.
I suppose if you like those independent movies at TIFF or Cannes this is something for you. If you actually wanna be entertained and see The Joker from the DC, this is not it.
Best description is millennial joker. Society is mean to him, nobody gives him anything so he cries and complains about it to get attention. When none is given, he starts killing."
"How can i speak something that my feeling cant even contain.. this is truly greatness.. a movie that moved you into something that you cant describe, so stressful, painful and sorrow, depressing, twisting, and oddly beautiful. Joaquin put act to another level, and de niro just fis right as always.. enjoy every scene, because everything may not as it seems"
"It premiered last night in Sydney and I was lucky enough to watch this masterpiece first hand.
The movie is flawless but because of its approach on mental illness and the execution of Joaquin Phoenix. The 80's settings brings a darker filter to it, creating a scenario where you see no hope for a person as the main character to survive.
The movie does not praise violence and it's far from being about making the Joker a ""hero"" or him starting a movement, it's all about a man trying to find himself. Violence is what happens in between and labelling the movie as such is a misinterpretation of the picture.
Also, if the movie had no reference whatsoever of the Batman universe it would work the same, it is a movie that sustains itself from beginning to end delivering frame by frame what it was meant to."
"This was such a disappointment! It was dragging on. And I was waiting for things to explode. I don't get the hype. Everybody is calling this a 'masterpiece', but nobody can tell me why it was such a masterpiece. If it was a movie about how a society creates a killer, then it was done very poorly. To me, it felt just like a large number of scenes without a real story."
"Writer-director Todd Phillips's new movie ""Joker"" appeals to me on multiple levels, primarily by offering an engaging story, strongly rooted in believable reality, related to audiences mainly by opposing protagonist's prevalent dark depressive moods while using often optimistic soundtrack and sound editing, shallow nonetheless rich visuals, angles and framing, theatricality augmented through expressive costumes, props and sets, but most impressively via great principal performances and acting choices made by Joaquin Phoenix in the lead as a title character (under proper fictional name Arthur Fleck), whose sudden uncontrollable and seemingly inappropriate laughter (justified as a medical condition) easily counterpoints the (painful need for) outcry from Gotham (read: any) City masses, hurt and deprived by injustices of their quotidian existence, as well as by Robert De Niro in a quintessential supporting role of a TV-comedy show host Murray Franklin (both worthy of the end-of-the-year acting award considerations), and by setting believable pre-course for the future adventures of the most realistic DC Comics character, the Batman (not a superhero at all, with his extraordinary capabilities rather resulting from his physical fitness and skills combined with high technology employed), who appears here only as a young boy, and whose later adult activities could be understood as largely driven by what has happened to his parents in the final scene of this movie, an event directly inspired by actions of Joker, henceforth his future main nemeses."
"""Joker"" is nor a ""masterpiece"" nor is it ""flawless"" as this board boasts. It's mirely a decent origin, albeit heavy-handed as sin, with choppy flow, poor directing decisions at moments, and part brilliant part wildly overacting on Phoenix's part. The heavy handed nature of mental illness is not written well... It highlghts many different illnesses with none of which feeling whole or handled with much, if any, sense of understanding. Sprinkle in are a few light-hearted moments to remind you that ""hey, he's still funny at times""... But with the strained mental illness angle it's difficult to laugh at these moments without a bit on introspection of what it is and who it is you're laughing at. The real ""danger"" this movie poses is that it's another Hollywood blunder with mental health and its handling... Which does way more harm than good.There is no great existential pandering, ss some are saying... ""it's deep"", ""my feels"", ""It's not a superhero movie it's a character study"", regardless of what anyone wants to categorize it as.. I'll consider it a generous 3."
"Arthur(Phoenix, Oscar-worthy yet again) is a clown for hire. He wants to cheer up the world. And to experience human connection. For someone to notice him without becoming verbally, frequently even physically, abusive. To be treated like a person. He struggles with mental illness. Both finding successful treatment, and for others to stop responding so negatively to his diagnosis. And while he feels perpetually lonely, he's not the only one to realize how bad things are getting, and how little those with money and influence do to help anyone but themselves.This is deeply messed up. It makes your mind go places you never thought it would. Including, maybe especially, when funny. In other words, it nails the core, managing to also put a fresh coat of paint on an icon with nearly 80 years of history. This explores how little sympathy and empathy(the lead only loses the audience's once he becomes a monster) is shown towards the least powerful people in society. However, it's not exclusively(albeit chiefly) about those with psychological issues. It also goes into poverty. How little those that could easily address these things even try to properly comprehend the problems. I'm not saying there's a solution that would not require time, political will and accountability for those who use their clout to try to fight these efforts. What I am saying is that we need those I'm talking about to join in the process.Taxi Driver very clearly shaped a lot of this, to incredible effect, and this film is as amazing as that one. This is the first live-action version(at least in the last 30+ years, I will grant that I am not very familiar with the takes that go back further than that) where you can understand how the Joker ends up with his signature look in a realistic world. A vigilante using martial arts and gadgets would have felt hugely out of place in this, so I'm thrilled nothing like that appears(Bruce is a child here), and I hope that this remains standalone, rather than Joaquin facing off against Batman. Keeping in mind that I love The Dark Knight trilogy.I rarely give anything the highest possible score. To me, it means that while the movie isn't perfect(that is a status that should be strived for: it can never truly be reached), there is no weakness within it that is not greatly outweighed by its positives. That's not even a contest when it comes to this. I can't put into words how grateful I am to everyone who worked on this for being able to say that about it.There is some bloody violence in this, a little of it immensely brutal. I recommend this to everyone who is passionate about the titular character. 10/10"
A breath of fresh airThink heath ledgers joker in taxi driver with a game of thrones like soundtrack
"Read all you like about ""Joker"" - there is nothing that will prepare you for the gut-punch to come. This is less ""The Dark Knight"" and more ""Taxi Driver"" but make no mistake, it feels like the most original take you have ever seen on a well-worn genre. It is an uber-violent character study of a mentally ill man trying to survive in a bleak society that is failing him. It is an immersive and cathartic experience, and an enthralling and uncomfortable one for the viewer.If there is a more perfect performance than Joaquin Phoenix commands in this film, I would love to debate it. His depth and range is an acting masterclass and somehow demands empathy in a violent and disturbed character.Todd Phillips stamps himself as a modern master with this film. The look and feel of the film has such pace and menace, yet at the same time creates a claustrophobic atmosphere.It is a brilliant film. I hope people continue to see it as a cinematic masterpiece and it doesn't get caught up in politics or become part of a narrative of the sometimes flawed society we live in ourselves."
"Just go see it.. The endFilm of the year by some distance, literally breathtaking performance"
"This was a brilliant film! A difficult watch, but a very important film that shows how mental health and childhood trauma can affect a person's life choices. Joaquin Phoenix was amazing! A true method actor, his depiction of the person that becomes the Joker was breathtaking. It was a travesty that he was never nominated for an Oscar for Walk the line but this will be a travesty if he doesn't win it."
I have never been so moved by a fictional film. Truly amazing and im speechless.
"With that being said. This is not a comicly accurate movie. It is a movie about man named Arthur fleck. Who is a clown that is a depressed person who fails at life. It's modern day Hollywood trash. With all due respect to Phoenix for trying... He is by far the worst joker because of the fake back story. Unfortunately the only real positive of this story is Robert de niros character... What a shocker a guy gets of his meds and kills a talk show host... I'm so shocked... Little does everyone know the real ""Joker"" falls into a pool of chemicals. At the location axis chemicals and becomes Joker. He doesn't take pills he doesn't kill people on Subways... Hollywood's version of joker falls short simply because of the story. Arthur fleck thinks Thomas Wayne is his dad? And Bruce Wayne is his brother because of his I'll mom? This the best story Hollywood got seriously? In all this is a movie about a guy portraying a clown that is having a downfall in life nothing more. If you are a true DC fan. Or resorc"
I sat through this slowwwwww movie and would gladly have left half way into it. Its a boring movie until the last 5 minutes... overhyped as usual....the violence must have been cut out of the version i seen as i think i have seen more gore in a disney movie
"Joker is basically the lite edition or postmodern version of Fight Club or the Scorsese films it lifts from. It's interesting to see how easily words like masterpiece and groundbreaking are being used for this, and that is the one joke that this movie successfully pulls off. It's just a whole lot of self-seriousness and posturing and is essentially hollow. It pretends to say a lot but ends up saying very little or nothing at all, not about the character nor about the society he's part of.It is also 'Joker' only in name and has very little to do with the super-villain. I'm all for a different interpretation and even an origin story for the joker but this movie fails to recognise or capture his spirit. Even 'Proto-Joker' doesn't quite do it justice, and I can think of a dozen more suitable titles e.g. Arthur, The Untalented Mr. Fleck, Smoker, Poser etc. Infact he's more akin to a less dangerous but also mentally unstable villain like Ratcatcher or Calendar Man though just with a clown theme, and is not even close to embodying the joker's extreme form of nihilism. It's not that it has to be a comic-book accurate portrayal, that would be irrelevant if it was genuinely a good movie. But far from being a masterpiece , it doesn't quite manage even that. It fails not just as an inaccurate portrayal of the Joker's spirit or essence, but also as a film about a person going over the edge.The weakest aspect of the movie for me is the poor to average direction. The movie lacks any of the subtlety and nuance that I was hoping for and what unfolds is not as much character development as it is things happening to Arthur. A good example of the poor writing and direction is the very Trump-like and one-dimensional Thomas Wayne character. This first became obvious during a scene in which some people happened to know the entire lyrics to a clown song. In a movie that otherwise tries very hard to be realistic that felt very unnecessary and took me out of the experience and it felt very contrived and predictable after that. It takes too many obvious liberties and plot conveniences to move the story forward in an unnatural and unrefined way, and ultimately felt like they tried to disguise the poor writing and direction with a dark and gritty atmosphere instead of those elements complementing each other.The only reason to watch this movie is Phoenix's performance, which while not groundbreaking is good enough to earn an awards nomination or two. I wouldn't put it in the same league as Heath Ledger's portrayal but they were two very different roles and characters. Ledger made his joker seem effortless while one can really see the strain and work Phoenix puts in. To put it simply, Ledger made it seem natural and didn't look like he was acting while with Phoenix you really know that he is, even to the extent that it may seem like overacting at times. Perhaps owing to the more physical nature of this version of whoever this character is supposed to be, that's not necessarily a criticism.Overall an average film at best that pretends to be a lot more. I don't see this one ageing well or being remembered decades later the way Fight Club or the Scorsese movies it's ""inspired"" by, or CBM's like Dark Knight or Logan or even Tim Burton's Batman, are remembered today."
"I was blown away by the script and performance.
Artistic, gritty, brilliant.
Oscar for Todd and Joaquin."
"I was underwhelmed - to say it friendly - but not surprised by the fact. Because Hollywood has lost its magic looong time ago. IMHO no. bo. dy gives a damn about Darth Vader's Childhood or Joker's relationship with his mother. All we want for centuries is a proper boogeyman. If you overpaid LaLaLand-Schmocks won't jump from the stupid Prequel-explains-it-all-train - please give us at least solid filmmaking. Joker is a mess. No story, no finesse, no build-up, no surprises, no ideas. But a load of layman-psychology that should make even 12y olds roll their eyes; a cacophony of more or less unrelated scenes; cheesy taxi-driver-moments without any impact; massive overacting by Phoenix and no subtle sinister Joker moments except for the two second Elevator-Scene we all know (and love) from the trailer. rating 9.0? A joke. Heath Ledger, I miss you."
"I didnt really know much about this movie. I hadnt seen any trailers for it or anything but i decided to give it a go while i was stoned with my mate Steve. we actually got tickets for a different movie but couldnt find our screen so we ended up in the screen showing The Joker. It wasnt til about 45 minutes in that I realised this movie is no good. I couldnt understand a lot of what certain actors were saying it was really mumbled and low quality. The story is so confusing its hard to keep track of who's who. There's a lot of scenes where literally nothing happens except for people talking or walking down corridors. I whispered to my mate Steve about an hour in to see if he thought it was as bad as i did, but he had fallen asleep.The good thing about the movie is the acting. the geezer who plays the joker is very good at it. Also there is a few very funny scenes near the end but other than that this movie is overly long, too complex, not enough action, and poor directing."
"While I enjoyed the film, it felt pretty short. When ""The End"" appeared on the screen I couldn't help but think - ""That's it?""Joaquin Phoenix was fantastic with his new take on the Joker, and it's mesmerizing to see his facial expressions keep changing. And his Joker laugh is unique - sinister and full of Joker's madness.However despite some minor plot twists, most of interesting bits in the film have already been shown in the trailers. Don't expect much action like in The Dark Knight trilogy. Despite the much hyped gun violence, there are less guns in this movie than in any other Batman flick.This is not a bad film, but it's not a great one either. Watch it only for Joaquin's performance."
"I do agree that Joaquin's performance was great, very well done and not an easy part to pull off. That however, was the only good part of the film. Movie was dark as I expected, but so much SLOW dialog it was putting me to sleep. Parts of the movie were VERY predictable, though a couple (literally two) of surprises that were good but didn't out weigh a very slow moving poorly laid out story. I say skip this one and wait for it to hit the other subscription services, I'd ask for my money back but I did stay till the end."
This movie is poorly done as to how it tells the story. It is a dark movie showing the problem of mental illness
"I just didn't get the hype about this movie. And why are we entertaining such violent movies. It wasn't nearly as good as I expected it to be. No doubt the acting was good, but apart from that there's no story. It's dark depressing movie, about a guy who's dealing with bipolar disorder and killing everyone around him, including his Mother. What kind of negative message is it passing on to the society."
"A country that makes mental health care treatment unaffordable to the poor (great surprise many of them are...), and blames poor people for being unsuccessful, thereby pushing them to the edges of society. Add to that the second amendment and handing out assault riffles to anyone, and there you have it The Perfect Storm.The most symbolic scene in my opinion is when the Joker puts a gun to his head and we see his face painted in red white and blue...An important movie, that will hopefully emphasize the problem, paving a way for a solution."
"That is best joker can i see
And joaquin phoenix will win the oscar"
I'm amazed. I was shocked by how perfect Joaquin's acting was. I never imagined that I'm going too see such a good interpretation of my favorite villain. Thank you for everything!
"So it literally blew me off...phoenix has given something to cinema which was missing from a long long time!!
The movie got released today, and imagine a theatre full of people (in india) and clapping during the film means it deserves every applause.."
Yes Joaquin's performance is good and the cinematography is pretty but otherwise I do not get all the hype about this movie.Not for a long time have I felt like I would be better off leaving the cinema than staying and getting my money's worth.For something that was supposed to be gritty and real it had a lot of convenient scenes to help push the plot along.Very disappointed.
"The problem with this movie is that it is too real. Maybe way too real for some people to absorb. Maybe it scares them, maybe it intimidates them, maybe it sickens them, maybe they are forced to see some things that they are not ready to see or forced to believe some things they are not ready to believe. But not for a moment does it change the fact that it is REAL.This Joker IS NOT your typical 1st gen or 2nd gen Comic Book villain. This film does not follow your typical MCU, DC adaptations of Comics. This is no adaptation of anything you've read. There are no CGI effects. No half hour long fight sequences. No alien races coming to help. There isn't even a Batman to this Joker. This joker doesn't birth from a chemical accident, but rather from the conscious actions of a cruel society to a point where you have to make your imaginery comfort zone... then losing that too.The loneliness, the darkness, the emotions, the fall from grace so beautifully captured that it haunts you. The fall in darkness so black it upsets you. It poses questions that hurt your conscience... answers to which you would rather avoid.You can't watch it, and he lived it. And that is Joaquin's Joker... a monster made by YOU."
"This Is without a doubt the best protryal of the joker, the way he slowly gets turned by society and becomes skinnier and crazier,defenanrly one of the if not the best movie of 2019"
"I don't write a lot of reviews but I felt compelled to do this if only just to put in writing the thoughts in my head..that apparently are a lot different from the thoughts in quite a few other people's heads when it comes to the perception of this movie.First, in order for you to understand mine or anybody else's critique of this movie, you absolutely need to have seen all of the following movies:
Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho
King of Comedy
Fight Club
Taxi Driver
Dark Knight Trilogy
Dog Day AfternoonSo let's do a somewhat categorized approach beginning with the obvious....Acting: JP does a great job purely as an immersive method actor. He gives it his all and for that he deserves accolades. The few areas where he falters with overacting are actually the fault of the director and the editor for keeping those scenes in, since the scenes itself were repetitive and could have been taken out. The other actors do their job competently. Wait, there were other actors? Yes, there were ! Plenty of poorly written, poorly characterised shell characters that gave the artists no real scope to perform given that their combined screen time was 10%! DeNiro was wasted completely.Casting: Just because JP did a stellar job does not means he was ideal for the role. Sure, if we take the 'Joker' aspect of it away, then he fits perfectly as a traumatized, declining man. But this is a JOKER origin story, and for THAT, Joaquin is too old! The timelines just don't make sense. The young Bruce Wayne as shown will become Batman after a good 20 years (remember Bruce was a successful older business tycoon before he became Batman) So by that time, this upper-middle aged Joker will be in his 70s? Come on now.
Zazie yas potential but was not given much to do. She did a good job. A legend like DeNiro should have never accepted such a poorly etched caricature role of Murray Franklin.Character development: Whoa. All the sheep are talking about this and how 'masterful' it was. Look at the movies I have listed above and you will see how much has been copied from them in bits and pieces and jumbled together. Do people forget that at the very start of the movie he was mentally unstable and on seven medications? So his decline from that into a psychotic killer isnt that steep.
The inaccuracies are plenty as well.
Yes, a person can decline in morality, social adaptibility, schizophrenia etc.... however, a person CANNOT suddenly become MORE intelligent. So how does this person who is depicted as a bumbling fool continuously evolve into a sophisticated well-planned killer and eventually become into the character known as the Joker who was a masterful villain?The laugh: The real Joker is supposed to laugh because he is a cruel and vicious monster and he laughs at his own jokes which are actually quite witty and also laughs at death and the misery he is causing, INTENTIONALLY!! The Joker in this movie laughs because he has a mental disorder and laughs involuntarily?? What the hell.? That deviation alone should make the movie ineligible to be called Joker ..from DC comics. It's simply NOT true to the character.Story and script flaws : Some already mentioned above. No matter what the lack of funding, patients with mental disorders never ever have their medications taken away, no matter which department shuts down. This has been the case for decades. Even less wealthy countries dont do that.
How does a guy give him a loaded gun for free to protect himself and then screw him over just like that?Music: Some the older songs were cleverly placed. The score was excellent in its quality however the placement of the music was highly manipulative in order to create a faux dark snd suspeseful aura. If I show you a video of starving children and play melancholy piano violin pieces in the background, you will cry too! Emotional manipulation through clever musical score placement is an old, old trick but the shameless overuse of it in this movie was akin to 70's shock horror flicks.Direction: All over the place. Todd Philips is trying to be Hitchcock, Scorcese, and Nolan combined and he is not even remotely close to any of them. He steals heavily from their styles but whenever someone does that it almost always creates botched pacing and repetitiveness of scenes, and oh yeah, there is plenty of that.Story: There is no real plot or story. The key turning points are weak. Even IF for the sake of argument the government takes the medications away from a person with a mental disorder, uh...hello, that person will get worse and out of control, but in this movie he gets smarter and more cunning and calculated? Not possible! The link to Thomas Wayne as his dad was a cheap shot. And how convenient of him to find such a properly thought out letter from his mom who is supposed to be crazy but wrote this very sensible letter that is of such importance, and then forgot to mail it! Haha I was rolling my eyes so hard my eyeballs hurt.The so-called 'social commentary' : Contrived and oh-so #fake anti-capitalist message. Oh, those rich people behind their iron gates are oh so bad. Boo hoo.. let's protest and riot and life will be so much better! What a sad attempt at cashing in on anti-Trump sentiment. And Oh, the irony. Rich people are bad but thank you Sheep, we are gonna cash out big on this movie... You want to see a real social commentary far far ahead of it's time? Watch The Truman Show.
The sad pathetic irony of the causes of this 'unrest' is sickening. Oh look at this guy. Living in an American city, has an apartment, has free medical care, has A JOB..how many people in the world would die just to have that! But oh look at him, he gets bullied, beat up a bit, (rightfully) fired from a job..(but could have easily worked for a fast food or cafe till his comedian act worked)....but oh no no no, THIS is the limit! Down with the rich, let's kill em all. Let people pay their hard earned money to watch this, while we laugh all the way to the bank and the truly poor people in the world be like 'wtf just happened?'.Marketing and hype: Wow. I mean really wow. This is a modern day epic example of socially manipulated and engineered mass-hype opinion manipulation. Word of mouth is sometimes beneficial, sometimes not. Remember, gossip and rumors also are a form of Word of mouth. When five of your friends say that a film is a masterpiece, most are going to say that they thought so too, for fear of being ridiculed as someone who is not savvy enough to understand such 'deep' movies.The other thing is that the comic theme will draw a relatively younger audience as well, many of whom have not seen the above listed movies to catch what I call plagiarism (but if he wants to call it a tribute, even then it's a botched one.) And these folks will flood social media with hyperbole terminology. Epic. Genius. Masterpiece. Legendary. Achivement...yawn, did I miss any?
And so on and on the hype train will go till we are past the Oscars and award season of fake oohs and aaahs and speeches about this pseudo-deep movie. JP should get the award mainly for effort and because he has poor competition this year, but that's about it as far as deserving-ness.Many have already questioned how this movie had literally thousands of rated 10 reviews on this site even before its premiere? Hmm....I say hmm..But whatever. If that's the way the modern game is played then fine. It is ultimately up to the people.
As Shakespeare should have said, ""To be or not to be Sheep, that is the question"""
"Right out of the gate you can forget about considering this a comic book movie. It may be based on a comic book character, but the character development and story line can be taken right from the pages of modern day horrors brought about by poverty, abusive parents, disrespect for authority, the distance between the haves and the have-nots, and an uncaring society at large. With a plot often times structured on ambiguity, the film explores the troubled mind of one Arthur Fleck, brilliantly portrayed by Joaquin Phoenix in what may eventually go down as the crowning achievement of his acting career. No offense intended to Jokers who have gone before, but Phoenix's take on the character now becomes the standard for others to follow, but virtually impossible to match. I must say, the hype engendered by the film prior to it's release relative to the amount of violence portrayed appears to be seriously overstated. Yes, there is violence on Arthur Fleck's part, all of it gruesome, but it virtually pales in comparison to what one might experience in any chapter of the 'Saw' series for example, or any number of slasher/gore flicks that rely on buckets of blood to 'entertain' fans of that persuasion. Together, director Todd Phillips and Joaquin Phoenix have created a complex character and a complex film dealing with the horrific and sordid side of mental illness that finds it's release in savage, sociopathic behavior. Though he may be called the Joker, as Arthur Fleck himself would surely attest, ""...no one's laughing now""."
"Somehow the darkest and most serious movies get the highest ratings. People say that this movie is so thrilling and that Joaquin Phoenix deserves an Oscar but at the end of the day, it wasn't entertainment. There were so many evil moments and dark scenes but what's so good about that?This movie was almost like instructions on how to be a psycho. They flipped the usual idea and boundaries of good and evil for the audience to feel sorry for the bad guy. People seem to think this is a good thing. It's bad!The point of a movie is to entertain audiences and this movie just made me feel depressed and miserable. I'll have to watch a movie where the hero is clear and the villain is clear so I can actually be entertained. The fundemental and successful formula for a film."
"What a horrible movie, from minute 1 you knew what's going to happen at the end. Overacting job of Phoenix. Poor acting by rest of actors."
"Critics have just spoken. ""JOKER"" is already the ""#1 Movie in the Whole DC Universe"". It's an ""incredible DC film to watch"", Joker is now the ""Winner Golden Lion Best Film 76 Venice Film Festival"" ""Joaquin Phoenix is Astonishing"", it's ""Exhilarating"" ""A Masterpiece"", ""A Wild Card"", ""10/10"" ""Five Stars"" and it's now the ""#1 wining Major Oscar Buzz, at the Box Office, for the Best Joaquin Phoenix's Joker"", and Todd Phillips just dominated Christopher Nolan's ""The Dark Knight"". This is why you go to the movies, and put a smile on your happy faces to enjoy."
"I was so looking forward to this film given all the hype about brilliant acting etc but yet again what a let down!The film had no real storyline in the past or the present and although the acting was brilliant I had real trouble understanding the plot, if at all there was one.ONE STAR IS FOR THE ACTORS"
"There was nothing mentally or emotionally intriguing about this film. Outside of the amazing lead acting, this movie's only suprise was that a known antagonist was the main character.
The script was lackadaisical. The events were over dramatized and intangible.
As a person who's suffered from mental illness myself, this movie did not portray a mentally ill person. It exponentially exaggerated what goes on with in the mind of the victim. Those who enjoy this portrayal are likely the non victims.
As for how the comic book character was written: this story did adapt the idea that the joker knows he's a villain and enjoys it. At the end Arthur is still just a guy going to extremes to be accepted by society, instead being the joker who reshapes/exposes society to be something he thrives in."
"A confused representation of insanity from a perspective of a sane person, a celebration of madness and chaos.
At last, I have watched one of the most anticipated movies of this year.
I experienced sadness, creepiness, joy, rage, confusion altogether, and it felt good.
The story was above average, sometimes the director seemed confused about what he's trying to say.
There were so many beautiful distinct pieces scattered throughout the film that gives you chills but ultimately they failed to form a complete landscape, eventually it became a gorgeously crafted baroque film with a sheer hollow inside.
It criticizes our self-centered, pretentious, empathy less society but ironically the movie itself falls under its own sword.Welcome, Tod Phillips to the big boy's club! His direction was crafty and pretty awesome though lack a little bit of originality. His trick with Arthur's illusion seemed a bit risky given its context. We will never know for sure if Arthur did go Murray's show or not!The cinematography was superb, there were plenty of scenes that'll enter your mind and stay there for a while.Joaquin Phoenix did his best, tried hard to embody the magnanimous character of Joker, he did pretty well, but sometimes it felt he was just trying too hard. Despite it's unfair to compare him with great heath ledger I must say he was able to pull it off impressively and takes this Joker to a distinct level. It was a one-man show and he's gonna get nominated for the academy award for sure.One of the most entertaining and satisfying aspects of this film is its music composition, damn! It was too good, and you'll get to see some insane dance move as a bonus.
The main problem with this film is the lack of originality and a precise plot, sometimes it felt like the movie itself was confused and wandering aimlessly! That's why it failed to become a complete cinematic art rather than a montage of eye pleasing scenes, and nothing more.Overall, despite its shortcomings, this movie is definitely one of the most exciting movie of this year.My Rating:7.5/10"
"There is doing an homage and then there is borrowing wholesale from other material. This film is little more than a remake of ""Taxi Driver"" with elements (most notably the end) borrowed from ""Network"".
In the case of ""Taxi Driver"" there are whole lines of dialogue, characters and scenes that are lifted from it and placed in this movie. Except the execution isn't as polished, the acting not of the same caliber and the story not as original.Watch ""Taxi Driver"" and ""Network"", this film was made 40 years earlier and was made better."
Joaquine phoenix's acting is just great and Todd Phillips direction and screenplay makes it even greater
Don't waste 2 hours of your life this movie is the baddest i've seen in a long time. Crappy writing and no good storyline...it was boring. I went to the pay counter to ask my money back for the 2 hours of torture...they can't do people like this. And for all the people with 10/10(the reason why i went) you're a  joke.
"Disturbing with very little entertainment value at all. I'm sitting in the theater feeling extremely uncomfortable and my mind is wandering to all of the young, white, disturbed men that have senselessly murdered people in our country. I don't feel this film would illicit the same behavior with stable individuals but we cannot know what impact it would have on emotionally disturbed people. Parents please be aware of the content before endorsing this film for teens."
"Whether you end up loving or hating Joker, Todd Phillip's gritty and Scorsese like take on the legendary DC comics villain, there's no denying that the cinematic comic book adaptations landscape has been changed forever.Just as Nolan changed our expectations for what a comic book film can be with his Dark Knight trilogy, Joker's examination of the birth of a nefarious villain hellbent on chaos and anarchy is unlike anything we've ever seen before, stripping the well known character back to the bare basics as we're introduced to the sad life of the misunderstood and unloved Arthur Fleck.Sharing more in common with dramas such as Taxi Driver and Serpico, rather than it's other comic book cousins, Phillip's and his mindbogglingly good leading man Joaquin Phoenix take us into the mind of a broken man trying to fit into a world that doesn't want to open its arms to him, in what's an engaging, cant look away character study that slowly but surely descends into a dark and uncomfortable place that befits the name and reputation of its title being.It may seem far to early to call but I for one am confident in saying that Phoenix's full embodiment of Fleck goes down as one of the most singularly impressive acting turns of not only the decade, but all time.Similar to what De Niro did as Travis Bickle in Taxi Driver, what Daniel Day Lewis did as Daniel Plainview in There Will Be Blood and what Pacino achieved with Sonny in Dog Day Afternoon, Phoenix commands every second of screen time he gets in Phillips dark tale, in what must surely be the biggest sure fire bet for an Oscar you could ever hope to get.From the way in which Fleck appears physically, from a simple walk, through to a slight facial tick, right through to a haunting and hard to forget collection of haunting laughs, Phoenix appears in virtually every scene of Joker and never ones fails to enthrall, and in doing so his managed to do the seemingly impossible of allowing us to understand a deeply flawed and depraved creature but a creature you begin to understand and at times even feel sympathy towards.For all the great incarnations of the character, it's hard to think of a better way in which the Joker could be born into existence and by bringing his own flavour and nuances to Fleck, there's no point in comparing Phoenix to Heath Ledger's iconic take on the face painted mad man, with this take a whole different beast entirely.As good as Phoenix is, it would've only taken the film so far had Phillip's and his team not come to the party but for a relatively small budgeted film, Joker's astounding overall quality ensures it can comfortably sit in the top class of 2019 films.It's amazing to think that this is a film from the same man that gave us Old School and The Hangover but Joker sees Phillip's grow into a whole new level with his on point direction, that fits perfectly with Lawrence Sher's eye-capturing 70's like cinematography and Hildur Guðnadóttir's memorizing score, giving Joker an epic and unforgettable cinematic verve that brings it's A game too match its captivating leading man.While first and foremost a believable tale of a man pushed to the edge of his already teetering limits, Joker also manages to throw in a number of surprising narrative and comic book throwbacks that will be no doubt be discussed ad-nauseam by die-hard fans and naturally tie together Fleck's story to a much broader universe without ever feeling forced or unnatural, all within a tale that is as confronting and even topical as you'd get regardless of genre.Final Say -Bleak, beautiful and boundlessly inventive, led by a Joaquin Phoenix performance for the ages, Joker is an outstanding cinematic achievement that's sure to be talked about for years yet to come.5 French Fries out of 5"
"I didn't spend any money to see this movie until it was completely free for me but I still find it a waste of a ticket and my time. A while back we had gone to see a movie and then messed up my blind fiancé's audio device that gives him descriptive audio for the movie and since they couldn't get it to working For a good chunk of the movie they had given us free movie tickets for a future showing.So even with the fact that we did not pay for this movie I still think it was a waste of a ticket and my time no I'm busSo even with the fact that we did not pay for this movie I still think it was a waste of a ticket and my time.You really couldn't feel bad for this character at all. And I see no connection between him and the Jokers of the past. This portrayal of the Joker is a dishonor on the original Jokers. When I went to my parents house after the movie I knew my dad had been considering going to the movie and I walked in and said don't waste your money dad just wait for it to come out on demand or on Netflix.I mean you can't even connect with this character on any level. And the way they per trail mental illness is just not realistic. He was just a creepy jerk. He needed to be locked a way like his mother was. But in his case he just needed to be locked up permanently in a mental facility. And at the end of the movie how they tried to make it all just because he was abused as a child. It didn't even connect up with him to make it change any opinions towards him because the things he was doing don't line up with a reaction to abuse as a child. Watching this movie really just felt like you were watching a movie about ""The day in the life of Creepy Pedophile"". They try to make it so you feel sorry for him but it just doesn't do that.So in my opinion even if it was free like it was for me it's not worth your time and money. if it wasn't for the fact that I was there with my fiancé for his birthday I would've walked out of the theater. So on a scale of 1-10 stars I'd give it 10 thumbs down. This movie is a piece of crap. Honestly when I watch ""Descendants 3"" babysitting this week that movie was way better than this one and this was one of those strait to tv Disney Channel movie and was a Second sequel. But seriously I enjoyed watching that movie babysitting more than I like the Joker. The joker sucked that bad."
"This movie was so boring, I kept falling asleep. I felt very awkward several times. My son & I kept looking at each other like should we just get up & leave? I probably should have. I cant believe some of the reviews on here. People have very crappy taste apparently. Just shows you, don't believe the reviews. If a movie speaks tour interest, go see it for yourself. This movie however, I wouldn't recommend. It's a total bore."
"The Joker won. Absolutely tremendous, what acting skills are we talking about ? It is amazing!"
"I saw the joker last night and was highly disappointed. Possibly the worst joker movie I've seen. I suspect after the hype dies out it'll go down to 7 on imdb.SPOILERS BELOWI concede the movie had some interesting moments and attempted touch on mental health. I'll ignore the marxist undertone of the rich as the evil oppressors and the poor as the good oppressed and the mask wearing protagonist violent protestors who kill cops.The main reason I disliked the movie was because the joker was in no way a genius super villain who could outwit other characters and the audience with his cunning intelligence. He was a sob story loser. He was in no way in control of anything that happened to him in his life and everyone got the better of him and he just took it. Even his co-workers quite easily outwitted him and caused him to be fired. He was just a sad dude. He was even bullied by a bunch of teenage kids who took his sign. What did the evil genius do? He ran after them and got the sh$@ beat out of him. Eventually when his medication ran out he started killing people and by pure luck he killed three rich men which led to his fame. Even his own fame was a complete coincidence and completely out of his control.This joker will have no chance of fighting Batman. By the time Bruce is in his 30s and becomes the batman the joker will be in his 60s, at least. The only thing this pathetic joker will be fighting is PTSD and back problems."
"There is a LOT of hype around this film, and a lot of people seem to think it's great, and whilst I agree Joaquin's performance is brilliant, I was bored stiff for most of this. The kind of film I'd turn off if it was on tv. I may have been harsh on the stars but I go to the cinema to be entertained and I was far from it. If I want art I'll go to a gallery."
"Was really looking forward to seeing this film. However having seen it I am very disappointed
The acting was brilliant however I was bored unroll the last half an hour. I have never considered walking out a cinema until nowI would say you have to go and see it as you can see by the reviews some people love it"
"After seeing the billboard signs all around the London Underground and learning that the critics has approved of the film in their masses, I was very much looking forward to what appeared to be a very different and almost arthouse interpretation of the Joker.Before I tell you what I think of the film, I want to go into what I believe the Joker to be and the interpretation of him based on the comic books. Firstly as per the source material, the Joker is not actually insane but rather what one psychiatrist in the comics describes as being 'supersane'. He sees the irony in the world and the way that it works. Like the Comedian in the Alan Moore comic book 'The Watchmen' (which at one time was going to use the Joker before settling on the Comedian character), he treats the world as 'one big joke'. The Joker does not like to conform or like to follow rules and regulations. In the comic books the Joker is a failed comedian who is driven over the edge after a series of tragedies and then snaps out at the world. This is by no way saying that his actions are ever justified. On the contrary he is evil, ruthless, daring, sadistic and twisted. But not conforming to societies rules and norms makes him far more intelligent and innovative.With that said, I was somewhat dissapointed in the way that the Joker was portrayed in this new movie. Yes, Joaquin Pheonix is a great actor who deserves recognition for his performance here, though I would stop short to suggest that it is an Oscar worthy performance. But the fact that his character of Arthur Fleck is compromised from the start with both psychological issues and a laughing condition, which makes him laugh uncontrollably when he is nervous or anxious, dumbs down the origins story. One does subsequently feel pity for Arthur throughout the film from seeing him get mobbed by kids on the street, being refused psychological treatment due to funding cuts, being treated terribly by his work colleagues and boss, having to look after his elderly mother, the issue of unrequited love with his neighbour, his subsequent humiliation at the hands of Robert De Niro's character and learning about his mother's past, which leads to the bloody and brutal finale. Ultimately, Arthur's transformation to the Joker is due to the brutality and harshness of society and the way it treats those who are different. Whether this is through its lack of caring for the the sick, the elderly, the mentally challenged or even the physically disabled. The fact that he shows some sympathy to the dwarf character, also strongly suggests that this Joker is not actually evil. This is the complete antithesis of what the Joker is. Infact, I really don't see this interpretation of the Joker successfully standing off against Batman. As a result the film left me somewhat dissapointed. Part of this was also because the script was very poorly written.The redeeming part of the film is the ending, which combined with several earlier flashback scenes makes you wonder whether the events in the film even took place or were just a figment of Arthur's imagination, very similar to the ending of Sergio Leone's 'Once Upon a Time in America', which suggests that Robert De Niro's character may have dreamed up all the events of the movie. After all the joker does state in the comic book 'The Killing Joke' that if he prefers to have a past, he would rather it be multiple choice, so this is a valid hypothesis. Which leaves us to ponder whether this film should be considered as Cannon to the Batman universe or not. I myself prefer that it was not considered to be cannon and an glad that it is a standalone film.The film is inspired of numerous films throughout the decades, which includes the Kings of Comedy, Clockwork Orange, Taxi Driver, Falling Down, Only God Forgives and Drive. However, I personally don't think it has the intelligence or effectiveness of Falling Down or indeed the panache of another film that I recently saw from Indian cinema, which I would highly recommend to readers, called Wajood starring the brilliant Nana Patekar. For me the Joker could have been a better film as a standalone study of mental illness, without the Batman Franchise being associated with it."
"I have never left a review for any title, good or bad but this is such a piece of garbage that I registered an IMDB account just to vent my opinion.
I want these 2 hours of my life back"
"I'm keeping it short, the movie sucks.Yes, I know there's a need to build character and crap, and I think it's important for any good movie.Same goes with this, I get it Joker was a troubled man, I get his frustration, but I don't need 2 hours of the movie telling me the same crap over and over again.Give the guy an Oscar for performance but throw this movie into the trash right after."
"One of the worst movies I have ever seen. Ok, maybe not but they hype surrounding the movie killed it for me. It's not a masterpiece but an ok film. Why the one star? Way too many 10's! For once I actually agree with the actual critics who graded this film."
"Film was directed and produced poorly. Opportunity to take advantage of the incredible Joaquin Phoenix was blown.Gratuitous violence. Misplaced violence. Wrong approach to joker.Disappointing connection to viewer. Film was wandering for long periods. Tons of footage that should have hit the cutting room floor.I really wanted an stirringly creepy connection with Joaquin as Joker. It wasn't there.If you are looking for Joaquin moment like in Gladiator, you will be very disappointed."
"Throw a bunch of money at a great cinematographer and a great actor, then throw in some gratuitous senseless murder in a comic book universe and watch the fanboys drool. ""It's like Scorsese!"" Yes it's derivative, except made by the dudes who brought you Road Trip and Hangover 3. Clichés galore and hardly any suspenseful scene building. It's crap, don't fall for it."
"I don't understand the high ratings. I went to the cinema with high expectations, only to discover that the movie was slow as anything and was almost finished before the first killing happened. It was a dreadful time having to wait for something to happen.
But yes, once the movie was finished and I finally walked out, I got the cosmic joke; I was the joker, trusting the reviews and leaving disappointed in disbelief I actually paid for watching it."
"Basically a bad remake of taxi driver with bits of King of Comedy thrown in to replace the underage prostitute parts ... oh and lets throw a little batman stuff in there too to link it to those popular superhero movies .
problem is unlike Taxi Driver the main character is very unappealing , unlikable , and hard to sympathise with ... not just getting retribution on those who have wronged him Bronson style - he's more American Psycho killing basically innocent people for fun . Glamorising violence against inocent people by the mentally disturbed not a great message to be putting out there nowadays .
also wayyyy too much time wasted on Phoenix dancing and mugging to the camera - they could have cut out 45 minutes and still made the same movie just less long and boring ."
"I watched joker film at the cinema. The film was awful and unexciting. Although the film is absolutely awful, the followers are increasing to watch it. I wouldn't recommend it because that gave me a bad message that the society is a negative effect on behaviour's human, For example: If someone past negative experiences, they will kill each person them abuse, that whether verbal or physical abuse."
"I really don't understand all the hype over this movie. I found it to be really boring.. and by the end of this boring, very predictable movie, I felt as though I just wasted my time and money.The only reason I'm giving it two stars is because the acting was good."
"If you want to watch a superhero/villain movie, then go somewhere else. If you want to see a ""descent into madness"" movie, watch Taxi Driver instead. This is just that movie with more graphic violence and - oh yeah - instead of driving a taxi at the end, this guy puts on clown makeup.The movie was also way to political, and it's message is just the same rehashed junk you get from most Hollywood movies nowadays. Just with more graphic violence and - oh yeah - clown makeup.Phoenix does a fantastic job, which is why I gave this 2 stars rather than 1. But the movie is twice as long as it needs to be and is only half as good as it should have been. I'd rather take the 2 hours I sat through this to re-watch The Dark Knight, where we see the Joker that his movie should have been."
"First of all, sorry for my bad English.
Btw, I went to cinema on hype wave with mr. Phoenix's Joker (and, of course, Im big lover of Jokers portated by mr. Ledger and mr. Nicholson). But what I saw in this movie is unacceptable.In any cases Joker is handsome character but the cause of his actions is always in his mind (or in his insanity). But not here. Mr. Phoenix's Joker - is a victim on society and mr. Philips say to us that ALL bad actions that we saw in the past - is the result of society. But its can't be true!If its true, then society WANTS to have shootings in Orland, Carolina, Las Vegas, all this peoples (and childrens!) were kill by our hands. Thats what i saw in this movie. All the human's pain was produced by our hands, by my hands, but this is not true, mr. Philips. I dont want to had 9/11, i dont want to have WWII (and WW1 also). This is not my birthday wish. So you was wrong, mr. Philips, with idead of this movie.If i want to protest against the society - I will take some anti-drugs flyiers and give it to my friends or visit some schools to tell childrens that they have to care of their siblings and help their parents or tall with parents to teach children do rights things in their future. Thats will be my protest against society. But not making a chaos.Btw, good play, mr. Phoenix, very well done. Hope you will take Oskar for that."
"Don't listen to the unbelievably high average score, this is not a great movie. It leans on cliches, it struggles to communicate vital character details, but it manages to pull together a strong closing act to elevate an otherwise inconsistent film.'Joker' stumbles out of the gate by throwing a plethora of ""troubled loner"" cliches at us. The scenes read almost as a list, giving the early stages of the film a disjointed feel that hampers any sense of immersion. The only aspect of our lead, Arthur Fleck, that seems original is his affliction. His sudden outbursts of laughter during tense situations are used to great effect several times throughout the first act.As the story continues, 'Joker' wastes time on a sub-par subplot involving Arthur's neighbor. Another sub-plot, involving Thomas Wayne, is far more interesting and clever in its execution.Ultimately, 'Joker' becomes a story of Arthur breaking free and flourishing in the chaos of Gotham. The final act revels in his now unrestrained insanity. However, the film struggles to convey a clear image of what exactly is happening within Arthur. Is he an idiot savant, or a brilliant mastermind set free of his bonds. You can go back through the film if you wish and identify plot points to either effect if you wish (the latter seems more likely in retrospect). However, this failure of communication lessens the impact of the film, leaving you somewhat disappointed.Nevertheless, the final act is an exciting close to the film, though it probably should have ended about 5 minutes earlier than it did (the final scene is unneeded). Regardless, the result is a unique and fascinating comic book movie held back from greatness by a shaky start and questionable communication."
"Joaquin Phoenix does a great job with the part he was dealt - but the movie itself was very bad. Draggy, with truly shallow character development (he is mentally troubled and Gotham is a harsh environment, you dont need 2 hours to convey that properly...).Todd Phillips is clearly at a loss to convey deep ideas through film. The trip through Joker is cluttered with terrible plot devices that offer to lead the plot down an interesting path, but inevitably lead to the most predictable, uninteresting conclusion you could have predicted.Saving comparisons for last - this movie just doesnt do justice for the Joker. He is meant to be a villian, not someone who to relate to. The Heath Ledger Joker was dark, twisted, and yet there was still relatability in his madness, one could understand his motives despite their general lack of morals, however this Joker seems to just be grasping for your pity - to the very conclusion of the film where you wont be sure if the triumphant music is supposed to be ironic, or if you are really supposed to feel like Arthur Flecks story has arrived at its fated end - Im quite sure the movies creators dont know themselves."
"Joker (2019) might be one of the most boring movies I've seen this year. It certainly gives Ad Astra and Hellboy a run for their money, at least.The slowness of the movie is accompanied with a score full of low notes on stringed instruments. You know, to give the impression that the movie scenes carry weight and importance. After hearing it for half an hour, it gets pretty old.Joaquin Phoenix was easily the best part of the movie. He clearly put a lot of effort into playing The Joker, but unfortunately, the script never elevates the character to be interesting or compelling. The majority of the interesting things in the movie happen to The Joker. The active choices Joker makes barely matter in the context of the film. The majority of the things we see Joker actually do are: smoking, dancing, running, getting beat up, killing, making bad jokes, and being alone. (In that order)The theme of ""Mental Illness"" is vaguely referenced multiple times in this movie. Ultimately, these references are so confusing, had no impact, and useless that they shouldn't have been there at well. (As opposed to Where'd You Go, Bernadette, where mental illness played an important and useful role) During the movie, social services get cut. But there are no consequences to this. In fact, by this point in the movie, Joker has already killed three people and started an imaginary relationship.Anarchy also plays a prominent role. Joker winds up starting an anarchy movement after he kills three Wayne Enterprises employees. During each interaction with or even seeing the anarchy crowd, he seems really pleased with the movement, and also shows a general displeasure with wealthy people. But whenever Joker is asked about his thoughts on the subject, he keeps saying he doesn't care about the politics. The message of the movie just ends up coming across as really confused because of a refusal to pick a side on anything and say something. On the surface level, it seems like the movie has a lot to say, because it keeps touching on these subjects. But it always leaves it up to the audience to determine what the film wants to say because the film says nothing.This is not a smart movie, or a powerful commentary. It's what Todd Phillips thinks that kind of movie looks and feels like. But hey, at least the cinematography was decent."
"I have looked forward to this movie for a long time. A big fan of the character and the actors themselves.I was very disappointed. The acting from this movie was brilliant without fault. I would give it 10/10 if it were based on that alone.The Joker character is supposed to be an extremely high trait psychopath absent of all rationale and sanity. The Joker character portrayed in this movie is human. It is someone who shows symptoms of paranoid schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. There are very few characteristics of someone that is a high trait psychopath. I have worked on psychiatric inpatient wards (including forensic) and have several degrees within the field. The Joker in this movie is a human-being that is unwell. I have done extensive research in both the fields of psychopathy and bipolar disorder. He shows symptoms of someone experiencing psychosis and very few symptoms of the dark triad (Psychopathy, Narcissism and Machiavellianism).The Joker character in the comic books and cartoons is supposed to be the most deranged killer and high trait psychopath that is INHUMANLY possible. What I saw was one of my patients suffering without help due to cuts for NHS funding, the US medical system. Adding to the stigma behind mental illness.I applaud the actors in this movie. They have represented people who experience bipolar disorder, types of schizophrenia and some personality disorder traits excellently. But this has added to the stigma of mental health difficulties. People who suffer from these conditions should not be feared.The point is..... If you ever are going to make a Joker movie again, ask for more advice from professionals.... You have added to the stigma of people who are mentally ill. Psychopathy is a trait not a disorder.Disappointed is all I can say."
"Excited by the many glowing reviews I sat down in my local Odeon with anticipation to watch Joker. Unfortunately it fairly quickly became clear that the Joke was on me. I feel like the little boy in the tale of the Emperor's New Clothes, the only one able to tell the truth about what I saw. Nothing but a gloomy, depressing character study with Phoenix trying and failing to hang on to the ciat tails of the incomparable Heath Ledger. Do yourself a favour and give this one a miss. If you don't it will be two hours of your life wasted that you'll never get back."
"This film is about mental illness. Specifically, a mental illness called creative diarrhoea. In the film, a band of Hollywood's most insipid producers, writers, directors and other such riffraff suffering from this ailment got together for a group therapy session, in which the therapist, a Hollywood mogul, had them 'let it all out', gathered the refuse and flogged it off for a few hundred million dollars.Seriously though, there is sooo much wrong with this movie. I won't even start with how I knew that a Joker sob story had no hope of (artistic) success, nor with why I went I went to see it anyway. I'll start by pointing out other reviewers' observation that this is not even the Joker. He's not suave, he's not witty, there are no lethal gimmicks, no morbid jokes, no anarchism, and he isn't a criminal mastermind. He's just a loser that goes off on a school shooter streak.Secondly, this is not, as I said earlier, a film about mental illness. It is a mockery of it, cashing in on the increasing awareness about mental health. There is not one concept about psychosis or other mental health problems judiciously explored in the movie (an illness which causes the sufferer to laugh in inappropriate situations? Seriously?!). All you're getting here is a downtrodden loner being subjected to beatings and injustices designed to spark indignation in the viewer, then going off on a murder spree.With regards to the much-praised acting, it's a mystery to me how anyone could have come to a judgement of Phoenix's theatrical achievement based off such an asinine script, because I can't. Not that you should devote an iota of attention to any of these positive reviews, because I'm fairly confident that there is some large-scale review rigging going on.The plot is one dimensional and juvenile, the dialogue as engaging as a monotone nursery rhyme and the character development shallow. There were goofs left right and centre, like revolvers with zero recoil and 8 bullets. Why did Arthur keep dancing? Why did we need to see Arthur fondling himself? Why is he so emaciated? Why so much smoking? I watched so many close-ups of cigarettes burn out it makes me wonder if the film was sponsored by the tobacco industry.The two positives in the movie for me were firstly, the final talk show scene, littered though it was with imperfections like the rest of the movie, which did have me sitting a little less slouched in my seat. Also, there were some interesting theories presented tying the Joker with the Batman.With the bar set so high by The Dark Knight, no director seeking artistic acclaim will go near the Joker for many years to come, maybe ever, but on the other hand, the Joker character has been rendered a boon for Hollywood opportunists, and this is the second time we've seen the character butchered in a low effort high budget money maker. This one will be forgotten quick, but I don't know how long it will be before the Joker himself recovers."
"Don't fall for it this movie is totally overhyped, borders between boring and irritating. Joaquin is good but the movie has no story and goes on aimlessly. Joaquin's behavior and crazy laughter is so repetitious. Who wrote those 10 star reviews?? Maybe family and friends of the people that worked on the movie??????"
"any motion picture that has Laurence Sheer(the cinematographer) + Joaquin Phoenix built in a Gotham setting will be a success.the movie argues that Arthur was pushed into this ""madness"" as a result of unfair, unjust and down right cruel society that Gotham was (how cliche) - nothing fun about that. a big part of the joker character (for me at least) was the joy he took in the chaos he created and this was rushed over by the director. Nothing to celebrate any where in the movie.the dialogue was extremely poor. Complexity of the character should have been exercised in words rather than just staring into mirrors and through the glass windows.some intense scenes were unnecessary. Just because it's overwhelming doesn't earn it the right to be part of the story.not a whole lot of originality. too many scenes were copied or ""inspired"" by and from other movies: Nolan's Dark knight, Scorsese's king of comedy and Taxi Driver.and ofcourse, anything that audience can't relate to is justified by ""well, it's joker! It's not suppose to make sense""Bottom line, don't think too much of it. Not a bad movie but everyone needs to calm down or perhaps the bar is set so low now that....Oh and the ""joker laugh""....lets just say, it was also poor."
"Joaquín Phoenix's unconvincing laughing, and looking like a beaten dog had brutaly ennoyed me after 5 minutes.
The world is mean and bad, and you can only be bad and hit back. Chaos, anarchy, whatever .. inspires bye a clown who killed 3 bullies.
More of this stupid excess of brutality in the name of... what?
Yes. It is the same director as in the hangover 3.
I don't want to be a partir of this.
Brutal and boring."
"The Joker for me was a disturbing and sometimes hard to watch revision of the Joker that not many of us saw coming, Phoenix brought a great effort to the table, but it was somewhat miss-placed for hysteria and mental illness. The Joker has always been known to be cunning, intelligent and calculating so I was surprised they made the Joker out to be so spontaneous and mentally unfit considering what we know he is capable of in a myriad of comics and movies. I do not see this version of the Joker outwitting Batman and the city of Gotham's authorities, he seems to be far too convoluted in the sense that people get to him mentally and emotionally far too easily, he is unstable and not intellectual. Heath Ledger's Joker was and always will be the pinnacle of the Joker, the perfect balance of humor, wit and insanity, it should go without saying. This Joker was just too weird and disturbed to be anything but a sideshow freak."
"Leading up to the films release it had high expectations and if im honest i was quite disappointed with the film, i felt like the storyline was pretty good and the acting although the long and boring execution of it is what killed it for me"
Arthur Fleck lives with his invalid mother. He is suffering from mental illness possibly as a result of childhood abuse. Budget cutbacks put an end to his weekly counselling sessions and he goes off his meds. In real life anyone else would quickly become non functioning but he seemingly becomes more normal.Consequently he goes from being a bumbling idiot to a highly skilled criminal. I didn't find that realistic at all. He also starts a hardly believable relationship with his beautiful single mom neighbor.It turns out that was in his imagination but the way it was portrayed made it impossible to tell which scenes were real and which imagined. The scenes with Robert De Niro seem like fantasy but apparently are real.There were many other scenes that defied belief:A random work colleague gave him a loaded handgun for free out of concern for his safety. Same person tried to throw him under a bus at the first sign of trouble.His neighbour left her door unlocked despite the dangerous neighbourhood.He was a suspect in multiple murders yet the cops made little effort to detain him.When he kills his mom in the hospital her ECG doesn't sound an alarm and nobody suspected it was him.Etc.Towards the end of the movie they recreated a scene from the Dark Knight which reminded me that Heath Ledger was 100 times better.I cannot see how the Joker portrayed in this movie could possibly become the Joker we know.
"Just to say that the film left me wanting to watch ""The King of Comedy"" and ""Taxi Driver"" the whole time, plus a few of the other films that this film strongly references. Joaquin Phoenix is fantastic however and the film has all the top production values that you'd expect of a big studio picture but it's generic and predicable in my opinion. It takes from so much that it's not it's own film for me. By no means is the film awful, it's just soulless. I'm not trying to be deliberately obtuse and against the tide of support for this film either, there are things as I've mentioned to commend and I'd like to add that going the way of gritty R rated film making is what I've wanted for years, from a more dramatic viewpoint, I thought ""Logan"" did what this film failed to do for me as a darker comic book oriented film. I hope people can respect my opinion just as I respect the free speech of everyone who really liked the film. Finally, I will add that those who have bashed the film for violence do not know what they're talking about. There are far more violent films than this and if one person or even a handful of people were incentivised to cause harm to others, the rest of us shouldn't have to pay for the odd few thank you very much. It's an interesting watch for certain and I'd recommend watching for that reason alone."
"The acting, the scenography, the soundtracks, the storyline, the development of the character, EVERYTHING in this movie is perfect.
I sincerely consider this the best movie ever made (and I know this is a huge thing to say, but I considered all of my top 10).Thanks for creating this masterpiece."
"I.... I.... I have no words.... Because words alone couldn't describe how beautifully this movie is made... This is the lowest a man could go... While we do sympathize with Arthur, they also show us why we should never take the path he took.... The Joker's path... Every single actor nailed their roles and Joaquin must definitely win the academy this year... We could actually feel and go through his struggle and his pain... Like I said... Words doesn't do it justice... Go watch it... Experience it... And the last act of the film just blows your brain away (spoiler alert!!)"
"These reviews claiming this movie to be a ""masterpiece"" etc etc, are absolutely ridiculous. You know the story before you walk in. Much of what happens you predict well in advance. Rather than entertain the audience, it relies on you being fascinated by the antics of a psychotic nutcase whilst trying to convince you that he is somehow heroic."
"Worst movie I've ever seen in my life, the only good part was when Joker shot RobertDinero in the face.
Unless you really really overboard into performing arts (not including acting, because they all sucked)
The only actor that was good in the entire movie was the social worker and the Arkham records administrator😃😄😂🤣🤣 🤡👺"
"Disturbing. Just got out of the movie. My humor was much better before seeing it. At first feel pity for the guy suffering, but he lacks charm and then well he is just a killer. Heath Ledger was far better."
"10/10. The direction, the cinematography, the score, the overall acting and tone. This movie would have been great based on that alone, but the protagonist brings something never seen before on stage. I have watched almost everything there is to see, and I had never seen a performance like Phoenix's. Words can't really do it justice. Must watch. Oh and by the way, apparently, it is a comic-book movie. Not that you can tell by watching."
"Story was just really unconvincing. Nobody really cares that much about some random dude who is as ineloquent and uninspired as the joker is. The hype portraying the movie as painful and cruel is just cringe. To see this rated better than ""One flew over cuckoos nest"" that shows way better cruelty saddens me."
"Strong fanboy and hype rush going on.
The movie is good don't get me wrong, the cinematography is amazing, the acting is brilliant, but the story is a bit predictable if you have an iq above 90. Its also really slow paced which can be annoying at times. Deff has it flaws and is in no way even comparable to Batman the dark knight. The movie is a 7 but I gave it a 6 to compensate for all the fanboy 10s"
A movie worthy of an oscar. One of the best movie in superhero genre since The Dark Knight. Phoenix is the actor who was born for this role after Ledger.
"Phoenix is great. The cinematography as well. That's it.The world described in the film is not realistic, despite what they try to *tell* you. They don't show, they never show. Everything that happens is finalized to sustain Fleck's downfall. It's not organic, it feels forced. A lot of ideas, none of them explored sufficiently.The movie is basically an amalgamation of Taxi Driver and King of Comedy. Too many scenes that were ""inspired"" by those two great masterpieces, that deal with these matters in an actual thoughtful and mature way.
This truly is the ""we live in a society"" film.I wanted to like it, I really did. I couldn't. I'm sorry? Go cry in the corner, if you're offended by my opinion."
Do not lead to torturing children (mother) nor murdering people.
"Just watched the movie, and I had to make an account just to put it out there, after hearing tons and tons of praises, that this movie has failed terribly in living up to the hype! I know that my opinion is extremely unpopular, but someone needs to say it. Joaquin Phoenix is brilliant as the joker, in regards to his acting, but that is probably the only positive thing about this movie. And I believe that a movie needs much more than just good acting. This movie does not even have a proper climate, and is basically about a mental illness, where I feel there is no hint of the charismatic, sick and brilliant joker we got to see in the batman series!"
Just went and watched the joker movie and it has to be the worst movie I have ever seen 1 out of 5 stars
One of the worst movies I have seen in years. Best part is Cream's White Room. Director is terrible.
"I don't get it. I think it's a case of ""everyone thinks this is great so I should too"". I was definitely not impressed."
The depth of the story was lacking to much focus on such a short aspect of the jokers life and he became the joker there was not much of a journey. The constant musical score was over dramatic and did not add much to the film if anything it detracted from the movie. All the actors performed excellently but this is not a movie to be entertained by our top be taken in by all the characters as the focus is so much on one person without a real journey.This is my opinion as my partner really thought it was a good movie. In the end I could not wait for it to be finished I think the character of joker has been devoured from the comics and previous movies.
I realy dont know those Masterpiece reviews its a realy boring movie whit nothing special a about it. Heath ledger its not realy happy in the grave about this movie
"Cannot understand why this movie gets high score. The content is so bad, gloomy and unreasonable. It is exaggerated too much. How can a mad guy who kill 03 men become a symbol for a mad society??? How can rich men always badly treat or make difficulty to poor guy??? Any reason for a mad crowd tries to protest a senator who is just only standing as a candidate for President position???
Three stars for the good performance of main character."
"I went to see this last night and I have to say I was really looking forward to it, when I came out of the cinema all I could think is why the hell did I want to go see that so much!!Joaquin Phoenix is fantastic as Joker but thats pretty much the only positive I can say about this.The film is 2 hours long and I can honestly say I was totally bored for the first 90 minutes, the last half hour is better but not by much. I found myself looking at my watch thinking when is it going to start, where is the gruesome violence that apparently makes people leave the cinema, in short it's not really there, I think they were leaving because they were bored."
Cause it's not a joke.Marvel fanboy is crying right now
"Some great moments, doesn't really live up to the hype though.
Phoenix's prediction of Joker's descent into madness was really interesting to watch and he will get many plaudits but the film felt like it was missing something. A few plot holes and areas where you feel like it's being dragged out longer than it needs to be. Definitely worth a watch, but don't go in expecting to see a 'film of the year'.
Ledger still on top."
"Joaquin Phoenix's performance is excellent, but the film is flawed, the main offenders being a second act twist that's visible a mile away and a small scene during the ending that feels tacked on.However, you should see this film at least once."
"As an DC fanboy lost hope on DC when they made JL, but i eventually started going back to the cinemas after Wonderwomen and Aquaman. When The Joker film was announced as Joaquin pheonix in the lead i must say i had my doubts. I was pretty sure noone could even match Heath ledger's Joker.. I was wrong. This might be the best DC film ever made! Joaquin pheonix did the impossible. Mindblowing performance as the joker! The best after Heath Ledger! Movie of the year! The laughs, screams, craziness and the dark psychological sufferings of the Joker will haunt you for the rest of the year. I must say The Joker is back! Trust me on this!
9/10 on this one!P.S This is my second 9/10 for a DC movie after TDK."
"I gave 3 stars only because of the spectacular acting, the writing and story get a 0 from me as it doesn't follow any of the hints of joker's origin from other films and shows, so I was displeased to find they made and entire new storyline. I was also annoyed that the Wayne's deaths were included in a new situation as well, almost as if Joker indirectly created batman. Simply I was unhappy with the story they put on the bug screen having been a DC fan my whole life."
"I had the chance of seeing a screening of Joker at the Venice Film Festival last week. 'Joker' was easily one of the highlights of the festival thanks to Joaquin Phoenix's breathtaking performance and Todd Phillips' clever directing.Although the movie consists of an amazing supporting cast, you mostly watch the movie through Arthur's (Joker's) lenses. Arthur is present in every scene of the movie, ala taxi drive. The movie clearly draws inspiration from Scorsese's 80s work (most notably from Taxi Driver and King Of Comedy. There's a lot of nods and easter eggs for the fans of those two movies). The gotham city we see in this movie is the most corrupt version to date, which is to be expected when our beloved caped crusader doesn't exist. It's a nightmarish vision of New York where corruption, crime and chaos are the leading forces behind everything. The story takes clever twists and turns that will leave even the most hardcore and well-read DC fans with their jaws on the floor. I wish I could talk about them but I don't want to go into spoilers. As for Joaquin Phoenix's performance as the clown prince of crime, there's really not much to say that you haven't read already. Phoenix literally transforms into both the role of Arthur Fleck and the Joker, giving us a super realistic and groundbreaking performance that even the Oscars cant snob. Joker is a strong contender for best picture.This movie is a must watch for both comic book and drama fans alike. It's a deep character study of a mentally ill man slowly sinking into madness that shouldn't be overlooked by anyone.Overall, this movie gets a 10/10 from me. I cant wait to see more small budget comic book movies about other DC villains (or heroes!)."
This movie was so slow... it felt like I had lost about 10 years of my life. The performances were good but it took so long to get to the interested parts. This movie was also super depressing. I could not get into it and didn't feel any empathy for the Joker. I was hoping that this would be better than wonder woman but it was worse
"Performance of Joaquin Phoenix aside the overall movie is way too overhyped. It is way too slow and repetitive in the first half, the setbacks haven't been shown dramatic and dire enough to justify his eventual behavior. The laugh is not vicious and more importantly out of place in most sequences. Finally it is not clear how and why he was able to mobilize all the anarchists in the entire Gotham."
"This movie is a shallow look at mental disorders, and somehow is 2 hours but moves in no direction and drops you back to the beginning. Do not waste your money, go see Hustlers."
"Normally I write the long review, but I'm going to keep it simple and concise this time.Without spoiling anything -- I suggest you do not read critics' reviews and watch this with a moderate expectation -- this film is an unexpected masterpiece, and the best comic book-based adaptation since Superman (1978).I have seen plenty of superhero movies, and I concur with Martin Scorsese's criticism of that as ""not cinema"" even though I differ with Scorsese's own output as self-indulgent and pretentious (in particular The Departed and Hugo were bloated and awful).However, Joker should be officially considered ""kino"" which is German for cinema, and utilized as a code of sorts among the Internet culture crowd to indicate ""encore; masterpiece; outstanding"".Watching this achieved something I did not expect, and that is of astonishment and catharsis. For that, my hat off to the reformed DC studio (which fired CEO after Justice League movie as a mega-flop to replace with a new leader) and Warner Bros that gave Todd Phillips and co. the chance to produce the bravest ""heavy and dark with the purpose"" cinema since, say, Fight Club, the latter I disliked but understood its messages.Joaquin Phoenix will not only own the Best Actor Oscar, but also that this film will sweep the Oscars with Todd winning Best Director and possibly Best Picture (Bradley Cooper being one of the producers)."
This movie gave me goosebumps and kept me on my toes for its entire duration. Joaquin Phoenix made me believe that he WAS the Joker himself which is actually insane.
"Brilliant acting for this film, found myself I was waiting for something to happen, get the message about mental health and how bad the system is, but something missing for me"
"Joker was epic. It's a fantastic character study centred around the most popular comic book villain of all-time but crafts a story that makes this incarnation of the character stand on its own. It's a beautifully crafted piece with stunning cinematography and art direction. I'm a fan of this changed appearance of the Joker. And Todd Phillips does a fantastic job in the director and writer's chair. Phillips' tackling of certain political and social issues will spark conversations in groups full of people smarter than myself, but I understood the messages that were coming across. But Joaquin Phoenix is one of the biggest draws of the film with such a praiseworthy performance. I don't really care for the Oscars and award shows anymore, but Phoenix deserves the accolades coming his way for such a masterful and haunting performance.One thing that I must point out, is that it's unfair to compare Phoenix to Heath Ledger's performance in The Dark Knight. They may play the character with the same name, but these are two drastically different portrayals in both performance and script and it's unjust to compare. Just worship the fact that we were given two immense performances from two different actors."
"I'm making sure to give this movie 1 star because it's definitely not a 8.9 - that's a lie.Joker is not an amazing movie. It's far from great. More to the boring side.It lacks plot twist and focus too much on character development. How many times someone needs to get punched in the face before they go crazy?He suffers, gets fired, has a mental illness, nobody loves him, he's sad and he cries and he laughs and he laughs again. And he kills some people, and that's it, that's the movie."
"It's beyond me why so many critics have panned and even encouraged people to skip this picture. I'm not exactly sure of why the vendetta's so personal; it's obviously struck a nerve . I'm taking critics less and less seriously since they rave about tripe like 'Lady Bird"" while trying to bludgeon a masterpiece like 'Joker'. This is the first ten I recall ever giving to a movie."
Joaquin nailed the joker character. Who would act so well without becoming one? The transformation is remarkable and leaves an image in me. Could not get the beat off from me.
Is anything real or is nothing real... as he descends into madness he has more and more intense psychotic visions... is any of it real? Or is everything just the inside of a psychopaths mind... I don't think any amount of deciphering of this movie will be able to understand it. Thats why it is possibly the greatest movie ever made. 10/10 is a low score... ha.. ha hahahah
I don't need to elaborate more - A masterpiece performance to the highest order. This is psychologically revolutionary portrayal of a deranged character.
"That's what this movie is. Forget about all those shills with 'masterpiece' in their reviews, this movie is baaaaad. It has nothing to do with DC or the superhero/supervillain genre. A poor man's Taxi Driver in clown make-up. And 2 hours of closeups of Joaquin Phoenix's face. The joke is on the people who continue to plop down money to see this joke."
"How is this Joker suppost to stand a chance against Batman? I thought what made joker such a great villain was his intelligence, his manipulative ability and his ability to see the inner fears of his rivals. How far will he get by only being crazy and unpredictable? Juaquin could problably get pretty far (all the way to the Oscars stage), while Joker can't even enter through a door."
"I was so hype after the trailer, and kinda expecting to be disappointed because DC you khow... but well it turn out even better than what the trailer had shown, and im grad its.
The acting in this movie is too good, hat off to the new joker Joaquin Phoenix. He deserved an oscar for this act.
The story line is still kinda classic joker's but its darker and a lot more twist, i cant count how many time i almost jump off my sit by suprise and excitement.
And there is sooo many dark joke... i love it."
"I'm not usually a fan of comic based movies. I was never a fan of batman because I'm having a hard time taking people in costumes seriously. I went to watch joker because all of the hype and I was genuinely expecting it to be a so-so performance. I went there watching the Heath Ledger's joker before, which was OK in my opinion, as I said, I'm not a batman movies fan.
However.
This movie is not about batman, is not about comics, is not about superheros. This is a drama film. A drama which touches you deep inside on a special level, a movie which you feel because at least once you will sympathize with the joker. You will find yourself debating inside, whether he should be excused for his actions. Seeing Phoenix portray Arthur, from a beaten man, to become THE joker, quite by accident, is an extraordinary journey. The movie deserves all the praise it gets, and some.
I can't recommend the movie enough, as it's just THAT good."
Ive only seen a few batman movies so i decided to go watch joker and since joaquin was the leading actor i thought it would be decent. i was impressed with the movie completely from the narrative to the soundtrack to the ending. and acting from joaquin was phenomenal deserves a OSCAR hands down!!! best performance ive seen in years since decaprio and the revenant. its so good im going next weeknd and watch it again...i havent done that since well ive never done that before. 10/10 movie i couldnt find a flaw in his acting role
Thank goodness I didn't bring my little one with me. Me and my older kids enjoyed it. This movie is very dark and violent. One of the best prequels I have ever seen. Mr. Phoenix really deserves an Oscar for his portrayal of the Joker. This one of my top two movies this year. Almost two and a half hours long but worth it!
"What an actor! Absolutely brilliant, loved it ! An Oscar winning performance for sure !"
A political incorrect movie but it real happen everywhere and everyday! The best movie this year.
"This is my first review on this site and I must say 10/10
Just saw it a while ago. No words to describe the phoemix´s job
Yes! Its one of the best movies of all time
and the oscar goes to...."
"Absolutely one of the best movies I have seen, and will see again...I enjoyed every twist, turn, and the furthering of the evolution of the character and the slow and drastic turn to violence and chaos at a whim. Fantastic movie!"
"Little to say. I expected a masterpiece of a movie only based on comic books, and concentrated only in a character study for the ages.It is.Perfect story. Twists. Real drama. Real pain. Darkly funny at times, but not comedic in the least. It is violent, as it should, but never glorifying violence like the rest of the comic book adaptations (even the ones I love like Man of Steel or Infinity War or...)It is just perfect. I give my ""Thanks"" to all the people involved (I gave my money too, which is more important to them).----------- As a negative, It's not particularly original, with too many things (a few times, scenes) from King of Comedy and Taxi Driver.
It is clearly better than those movies though"
"This is the definition of the word STUNNING! Because that's what Phoenix was at this movie! It is a performance of a lifetime! I have no idea how he achieved this turn and brought this character to its highest but it cant get any better. We love all Jokers but here we have a different character, a different man, a man that we can finally understand, finally understand Joker's Why... This character was portrait-ed multidimensional by Phoenix! It was about time to expose today's society. This movie will shock you in a way, make you sad and at the end it will make you happy with the Batman connection and the comic and gaming scene! The whole movie was a masterpiece and can lead to many awesome sequels with Batman, Harley Quin etc... They just need to be careful. An Oscar performance with a small budget! Good job DC."
The best movie of this year. The best Joker I have ever seen. Very realistic
"Well, this was certainly quite an anticipated movie, and just to think that it was made by the guy that came up with The Hangover. Then again this film is certainly not a pleasant movie by no means, but that certainly does not necessarily mean that it is a bad movie. Yeah, it is meant to make you feel really uncomfortable, and in a way you sort of also feel a lot of sympathy for the main character. In a way, by the end of the film, I am really wanting him to actually become the Joker, though of course this is all left in Limbo with the way the ending actually comes about.One thing I have to say is that Joaquin Phoenix is absolutely outstanding. I remember people suggesting that nobody could ever top Heath Ledger's portrayal of the Joker, and of course there was Jared Leno who came along with Suicide Squad, yet Joaquin Phoenix truly moves this character to a completely new level. Yeah, we all suspected that the Joker was crazy, but the way Phoenix captures the dark insanity of the character, the way he captures his mental illness, is absolutely outstanding.Thus, what begs the question is, could he actually be the Joker that we all know and love (and if it wasn't for the fact that the Joker is a much loved villain we wouldn't have got this movie - in fact I'm not at all sure if there is any other villian out there that could literally have a movie of their own). The reason I say this is because Phoenix's Joker is seriously disabled, yet when we encounter the Joker elsewhere, while he might pretend to be crazy, he all know that he has his wits about him.The thing is that I don't believe that Phoenix's Joker could actually be the 'clown-prince of crime' because, well, I'm not entirely sure whether he is actually capable of interacting with people, let alone being the calculating criminal that he is famous for. The reason is that he really doesn't seem to be capable of being able to interact with people. In fact, he is more of a symbol, this is something that slowly becomes relevant as the movie progresses, until we get to the end. Of course, the ending is very ambiguous, and some of the suggestions that he is a joker as opposed to The Joker, really doesn't sit with me all that well.However, in a way it sort of makes sense, him being a symbol and all that. One suggestion, and it is a suggestion that I sort can agree with, is that he actually died in the car crash (something that isn't all that surprising considering he was hit by an ambulance on the side of the car in which he was sitting), and the crowds removed him carefully, as if he was some sort of martyr. Sure, the final scene certainly doesn't suggest that he is in heaven or anything, but the thing is that many characters literally take on a force of personality, one in which the actual person could never fulfill, and Arthur is certainly no leader, not in that sense of the word, and as such he can really only exist as a symbol.Yet we must remember that there is so much about this film that we simply do not know what is truth and what is hallucination. The thing is that Arthur is seriously disconnected from reality, that becomes pretty clear with the 'relationship' that he has with the woman down the hallway. Yeah, once that becomes clear, and it should not have been any surprise as all, it really throws into a lot of doubts what is actually happening, what is real and what is not. Then again, there are a lot of scenes going on in the background, which do give us hints that there certainly is a reality that is unfolding, which means that he certainly did kill the three men on the subway, and murdered Murray live on national television.Yet even Thomas Wayne, a character that is certainly not held in such high regard in this film, has an ambiguous side to him. Then again, in the other Batman films, we see so little of the character that he is seen as some angelic figure. Yet in this film, once again, the truth, and the reality, are two completely different things. Still, the whole question of whether he did have an affair with Arthur's mother, and that Arthur is actually his illegitimate son, is certainly thrown into a lot of doubt.So, yeah, this is a pretty awesome film, and it is certainly one of those films that is going to leave you thinking and trying to understand it for quite a while after leaving the cinema. Honestly, it is pretty good that we are starting to see more of these movies come into the cinema now, after a very long drought full of a bunch of quite sub-par action flicks."
"I'll first start by saying this movie is very dark. It's the type of movie that makes you uncomfortable at some point in every scene. That being said, it's exactly the way this character should be portrayed. Amazing performance by Joaquin Phoenix as he takes you through the journey for Jokers evolution. This isn't a movie full of action packed fighting or battle scenes. Instead, it's a real life example that mirrors our world today. Amazing performances. Amazing film."
I was just stunned after watching the movie . A sure nomination for the Oscars !!!
"Hated was looking forward to it. Its not for anyone to watch. Promotes hate violence suicide and Murder.
Please pick another movie to go to. Not sure what movie the other people were watching."
"Parisians love movies. As I walk around the city, I see hundreds of movie theatres with all kinds of movies playing. Today, I decided to look at a big, multiplex movie theatre that is right around the corner from where I am staying, UGC CINÉ CITÉ LES HALLES - would you believe it is showing 46 films on 27 separate screens?When you go to a French movie and you speak as little Frecnh as I do, you'll need to go see an American or English movie that is NOT dubbed but rather sub-titled. France has acronyms that describe what you will see -VO stands for Version Originale, or the original version of the film with French subtitles for audiences that do not understand the native language of the film.VF stands for Version Française, meaning that it is the French version of the film which has been dubbed with French audio - no subtitles.VOSTFR stands for Version Originale Sous-Titrée en FRançais, meaning that it is the original version of a film with subtitles in French.Finally, the term VOST stands for Version Originale Sous-Titrée, or the original version of a film with subtitles in the film's original language.Most American films are dubbed in France and it is strange to hear the voices since they are nothing like the actor's real voice.I saw Joker at a packed house. The audience was much more quiet than an American one. But, first, let me answer the question I know you are asking yourself - and the answer is Yes, they sell popcorn and it's good, but you'll have to first answer the BIG question when you order - sweet or sour? Sweet? Sour? I answered - sel, seulemont (salt only). The young woman was incredulous, but gave me my popcorn.The most important thing about the movie you should know is that Joker is not about the Joker you and I and the rest of the world associate with Batman. This Joker is the Joker who became that Joker. Yes, eventually, he commits crimes but they are the ordinary crimes that most non-supervillains commit.This Joker, played with wild abandon by Joaquin Phoenix, is a mommy's boy who has delusions of being normal. He lives in a city that resembles New York City in the 1970s. If you weren't there, it was a garbage-strewn, graffiti-emblazoned mess. Arthur Fleck, Joker's real name, is a clown who plays at childrens' parties. One day, he loses his job (the reason is silly) and discovers that his much-adored mother (Frances Conroy) may be as crazy and delusional as he is. Along the way, the film takes potshots at cutting the funding for mentally ill people - anyway, it's a really bad day and Arthur snaps.One of his heroes is a Tonight-like show's host, Murray Franklin, played unconvincingly by Robert DeNiro. I think that is the first time I used that word to describe a DeNiro performance, but his totally stiff appearance makes his being cast as a Johnny Carson-ish character one of the greatest miscastings in the history of the movies. I mean, DeNiro would be better cast as Robin Hood or Cary Grant. Add the miscasting to the fact that the character is totally unappealing and you have hit the movie disaster jackpot.Arthur longs to be a stand-up comic and make people laugh. His mother, may or may not have had Arthur during an affair with Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen) - and there's your Batman connection.Joker is one of the most evil films I have ever seen. I know that seems a strange word to use, but this movie cynically uses the depressingly wide gap between the haves and have-nots in America to act as a backdrop to a story that has no purpose other than to make us wince and squirm. Director/co-writer Todd Philips' most famous contribution to cinema has been the Hangover series. His writing partner, Scott Silver's last movie, The Finest Hours, lost $50,000,000.00 in the US. Hollywood studio heads, if you don't understand the anger of female writers and directors in Hollywood, take another look at Scott Silver. Yes, he was nominated for an Oscar for The Fighter, but there were three other writers on that script. Seventeen years ago, he wrote a hit movie, 8 Mile. Since then he has done nothing of note, yet here he is co-writing a big-budget movie and making a mess of it.I emphasis the creators because this is one of the most poorly written scripts I have even seen made into a big-budget movie and I have seen some doozies. This is a movie that made me run home to shower. It is such an ugly look at the world that there is nothing at all that is redeeming about it. The most shocking moment is when we see Mr. Phoenix in his underwear - he looks seriously ill, almost malnourished. And his excesses don't stop there - his is one of the most undisciplined performances I have ever seen.I have to mention the score because it is as bad as the rest of the movie. Written by Hildur Gudnadottir, it stops and starts and then disappears then BANG! BOP! Then it's just gone. Two words came to mind when it was over - thank god.Joker is a world-wide hit. Some would argue that is the proverbial bottom line - who cares that it's not only junk, but evil junk, lots of people have gone to see it. Lots of people, in the past, have gone to hangings, beheadings, bear baitings and public burnings too. I am certain most people went to see Joker thinking they were going to see the Batman franchise Joker who had been played thrillingly by Jared Leto, Heath Ledger, Caesar Romero and Jack Nicholson. Well, the joke is on them. Us. Me. You."
"Joaquin Phoenix is good. The directing is pretty good. The writing is absolutely awful. This movie is trying so hard to be relevant and to have a 'message' that it just throws a jumbled mess of quasi-commentary at you hoping something will stick. It is completely unclear what exactly writer/director Todd Phillips is actually trying to say, if anything. Is Joker a hero of the resistance or is he an incel? Does he go crazy because he's mentally ill or because people are mean to him? Both rich people and poor people are horrible to Joker so what exactly is the class commentary? It's also confusing how Robert De Niro when this movie is clearly ripping off Taxi Driver in many ways, also with a little Mr. Robot thrown in. There's also a subplot with a neighbor that is so incredibly stupid and pointless, which actually has no bearing on the story whatsoever. The movie is also just listless and boring throughout much of it. A movie can be slow-paced without it being boring if interesting things are happening that are driving the plot towards it's conclusion. The only thing driving the story in this movie is knowing that he's going to become joker at some points, not anything that actually happens in the movie. The movie also spends like 5 minutes making fun of a little person for no clear reason. Also for people saying that this movie does a good job saying why you should be nicer to people especially if they're lonely or have mental health issues: firstly you shouldn't need a movie like this to be nice to people, secondly you can make a movie like that where the lonely/mentally ill person doesn't become a murderer since mentally ill people are more likely to be victims than perpetrators of crime, and thirdly if you want a movie showing why you need to empathize with criminals why not movies about all the people of color who have been victims of mass incarceration and were locked up on nonviolent charges instead of a movie about a white male becoming a mass murderer. This movie is terrible."
"This is an origin story of a famous superhero villain, and not quite. You don't need to have extensive knowledge on all the lore of DC supers because Joker is a fresh new take on the very popular character. It is a film with an anti-hero protagonist, and an anti-superhero in terms of its overall tone. I must say, it is storytelling at its finest."
This was a wonderful study of the what could be behind the Joker. It is also a great commentary on our society and times and how the Media and the 1% create all of the problems that the rest of us are expected to deal with. Thomas Wayne is a great representation of the elite political class and how they think they know what is best for everyone.
"Many of us over the years have been attached and thrilled with the ""Clown Prince of Crime"" as D.C. comic fans know as the one and only ""Joker"". And we've seen different takes and spins from Romero's camp, to Ledger's dark wild crazy turn, and the man the one and only Jack played the clown with vanity and brought a proper turn to a bad guy while having fun(Nicholson's ""Joker"" was like that of the late 70's early 80's ""Joker"" in D.C. comics) now enter Phoenix who's much different with a creepy origin story.Set in the early 1980's Gotham city is gritty, raw and the social and political climate is in the gutter as just getting by is so tough. And just tip toeing and dancing his way thru the drama is Arthur Fleck(in a hell of a turn from Joaquin at least nominate him for a ""Golden Globe"" or ""Oscar"") a lonely and depressed mommies boy who's a skinny starving clown who just can't fit in he's a society misfit. It's really somewhat of a sad character study.However hope is possible in the form of Fleck wanting to get away from being a clown for children as his real dream is to be a standup comedian as his smile and crazy lasting laugh is always present! As laughter is the cure for his pain! His hope of escape is to appear on a late night talk show hosted by Murray Franklin(Robert De Niro) where Arthur hopes to showcase his talents. Also the only other wild card pleasure he has in his life is dating a single mom named Sophie(Zazie Beetz) from his apartment building. And his sick mother Penny keeps Arthur hanging on with love and hope as that keeps him hanging on.Only secrets and ghost of the past and painful memories only destroy the fragile mind of Arthur even more as a connection to millionaire Thomas Wayne is revealed and even more shattering is how this connection and more events will lead to ""The Dark Knight"". Great and excellent work from director Todd Phillips who despite making a stand alone dark character study still connects things up with others in the D.C. universe.Many might see this picture as a dark tragedy I think it's a take and spin on how one is affected by life and then they take on a different role after years of being abused and mistreated in the world by it's people. Still this film is excellent because it's unique and finally glad a stand alone movie celebrates ""The Joker""(the greatest comic book bad guy ever!) As Joaquin's performance was raw, gritty, and a lashing out of some payback to society. Wow enough said best D.C. comics character study ever made!"
"Very good movie. The first half of the movie was slow, but second half was amazing"
"Such an incredible reimagining of a fan favorite classic supervillain. This movie is set in the 80s but consistently feels like present times, which is a triumph in itself. Joaquin Phoenix again cements his immense range and talent as he completely absorbs the audience with his commitment to the character. Director Todd Phillips also proves once and for all that he too has a wide range of talent as a director and can take his films to the next level.
Astonishingly beautiful score writtenCompletly grasping and thrilling plotThought provoking message about mental health and the underprivileged in this country.10/10 Would Highly Reccomend"
"Phoenix fitted so we'll in his role as The Joker, reminded me of Health Ledger."
"Watched this film after hearing how great it was, but also aware it was a controversial film.
Simply put - this is a marvellous film, you don't need to read any of the reviews
i have watched it twice already and I'll most likely watch it again.To my mind - it's a Masterpiece.
I have the feeling this film will be talked about for a long time."
"If you like movies with no story and 2 hours of blah blah nonsense, this is for you! It was by far the most boring movie of 2019. A Joaquin Phoenix who overjusts, he wants to look like Depp? Of course, I understand the story of isolation and the psychological side. But what makes this film so special that it deserves a score of 8.8? Because of Joker's laughs? Because he shot people? The dark side was much better worked in Dark Knight Rises, here we are in a dark register, gore, depressing. Strange that this film is marketed in the United States when we see that it prone the ideology of Marxism.
Only the Joker had a character development. All other characters are boring stereotypes that do not contain a single story.
The cliffhangers are all predictable!
To conclude, I do not see this Joker fighting Batman at all."
"Just saw the movie in a midnight premiere in our local and favorite movie theater, and all I can say is thank you! Thank you Mr. Phoenix for a truly awesome, lovable and emotional performance, thank you Mr. Phillips for your creativity and writing. When it comes to Batman and all of Gothams citizens in the movies I'm always pretty sceptic wether they'll be played and portrait right, but when Mr. Phoenix was announced as the next Joker I knew there was no need to worry, then came the first teasers and trailers and my hope grew bigger, and now all I can say is thank you!!"
"Simply put, this movie is no masterpiece and if you think it is, you need to see WAY more movies. And by way more movies, I mean movies that aren't superhero movies. The funny thing about all the people who call this movie ""a masterpiece"" is that they can't qualify that claim in any way. Try it for yourself - ask the next person you talk to about Joker why it's a masterpiece. If you're lucky, you might get a response that goes as deep as them saying something vague about the writing and directing being amazing. Ask them to explain that. I guarantee you they won't be able to. This movie is one note, from beginning to end. Joker is crazy at the start, and crazy at the end. There is zero nuance, subtlety or character development. He simply goes from being crazy to crazier. It is cynical, lazy and a dull retread of the REAL masterpieces (like Taxi Driver and King of Comedy) from which it shamelessly steals (poorly, I might add). Beware of anyone who calls this a masterpiece, they have zero understanding of cinema."
Never have I ever sat 15 mins after the movie ended just thinking about what happened. This movie is a masterpiece of this decade. I don't think any other movie of this decade will top this.
AMAZING 😍 GENIUS!! A REAL MOVIE. WILL WATCH OVER AND OVER AGAIN
"One of the most brilliant acting performances I have seen this year. Joaquin makes sure every eye is turned squarely on him, whether in the story or in the theater. You find yourself empathizing with Anthony in the first third, with the world against him, being kicked by young boys in the very first sequence, to losing his job. He's a nobody, and you feel for him. This starts to unravel in the next third, where you're struggling to find justification for why you sympathized with him, and the last part hits you hard, making a fool out of you for trying to justify a violent dangerous man's actions.
Joker is a masterpiece, carefully balancing Anthony's everyday actions with an almost eerie background score warning you of potential danger that lies ahead. It shows the destruction of a man into a new entity, who is remorseless, broken, dangerous and unpredictable- the Joker.
I loved the portrayal of Thomas Wayne as a typical rich businessman, and not the hero we're led to believe with the previous films, was brilliant, because the movie is from the point of view of a lonely lowly man like Anthony. I also loved the interaction between Bruce Wayne and Anthony, you could see the hunger and jealousy and the resentment in the eyes of Anthony when he talked to Bruce, believing that Bruce's life could have been his.
I love the parallel of showing how Bruce's innocent life ended with his parent's lives, and at the same time, Anthony's life too ended, in a way, by him fully accepting the Joker persona.
The movie is one of the best there is, without the use of CGI, without it being 3D, it's just a trodden man's descent into madness that is shown masterfully. Superhero/Origin Story fatigued? This breaks the shackles.
PS. Joaquin has played the Joker better than Heath Ledger, and this is the highest compliment I can give him."
"Wasnt sure if I'd be a fan of seeing the jokers origin story on the big screen specially as half the appeal to the joker is the mystery of his origin baring the red hood origin anyway. Thought it was a brilliant watch seeing his slow decent and learning how his tragic upbringing molded him. The ending when emerged as the finished product ""the joker"" honestly dont think an origin story could of been none better and the acting performance from Joaquin phoenix was top notch!"
"Cinematography and acting was perfect , and they story depend on personal perception , it will get deep in your soul if you put your self in arthur situation ."
"This movie will earn Oscar best Actor.
My concern is this movie makes you feel sorrow for the criminals.:)"
"Amazing, Fabulous, Smashing, Masterpiece, every second of this deserve a big clap
Tod Phillips made it like every joker fan wanted, if Joaquin doesn't get Oscar then we must check the last oscar winings!"
"I couldn't find a negative thing about this movie.
It's bold and brilliant. Joaquin Phoenix gives one of the best performances I have ever seen.
You have to go and see this. The only reason it has negative reviews is because some people were expecting another superhero movie with action - thank god it's not."
Absolutely stellar performance by Joaquin Phoenix. His portrayal of Joker is so realistic and gripping. Emotions overload.
"Wow just wow, I was skeptical going in thinking anyone would come close to ledger or hamills jokers, but this THIS is nothing short of a performance of a lifetime by phoenix, he has BLOWN ME AWAY!"
"Aw it yesterday in India (it released here on 2nd October).. My opinion: Brilliant film helmed by Todd Philips with an Oscar worthy turn by Joaquin Phoenix as the Joker. This movie is more ""class"" than ""mass"". This is a very unique take on the character, very different from the Dark Knight's Joker that was played so awesomely by The late Heath Ledger. The film stays with you long after the end credits roll. I would like to add that it would be unfair & unnecessary to compare Joaquin's Joker with Ledger's Joker, since the same character is written differently in both films, and both these brilliant actors succeed in leaving their own unique impression on the viewer. And yes, the violence in this film has been totally overhyped some of the media outlets, the film is more a character study/drama with only a few scenes of violence that have been placed in sync with the story. Those expecting an ""action"" film, are likely to be disappointed.
Though this movie was planned as a standalone, I hope the success of this film inspires a Sequel.
My rating: 10/10"
"Out of this whole year I have never watched a movie that played with my emotions quite like this film. Joker is a character study on one of the most famous villains in the dc comics but this film is not what you expect. It's more of a story of a man who has a mental illness and just keeps going to the more extreme side of insanity. This movie does that so well and Joaquin Phoenix has one of the best performances of this year and deserves on Oscar. Robert De Niro, though having a small role, has an amazing performance as well. The story is very much inspired from taxi driver but is very different as well. This is a much watch movie for any person comic fan or not. MUST WATCH AMAZING MOVIE!!!!"
"A thought-provoking, disturbing 2 hours long journy will haunt you for a long time. Thanks to tod phillips with an diffrent style of telling a story with an impeccable performance by Joaquin Phoenix, it is an unbelievable cinema experinece with creating a new genra of cinema as art!"
It would take me hours to describe my feelings for this movie.I went to the cinema expecting to see a great performance from Phoenix...but...it wasnt just him....Everything was great the story the music the photography directing...Phoenix will win the oscar (im sorry for the rest of the contestants)..Everything is just WOW about him ...what a great movie ...Just a reminder to Hollywood that a great script with a great acting has no need of special effects or cgi or action scenes or whatever to make the top...Go back to movies like that ..make sure the story is good and the acting is good and forget about the restCongraz to everyone for that masterpiece...and we the viewers thank you!
"It's pretty apparent the modern generation of critics are here to pader to big dumb billion dollar movies. This is an excellent take on the joker and keeps its focus on a mentally ill mans fall into absolute madness. Its dark and requires attention to follow the plot. Unlike your majority modern movies which tend focus on CGI and explosions with brief plot overviews. It also doesn't try to tick boxes to appease the 1%. It focuses on mental illness and the joker. No LGBTQ, Racism, Gun Control, Police Brutality, Women's issues etc..."
DC finally gives us a good movie after keeping us waiting for a long time.
It's just that boring. really can't understand what the hype is all about??!
"This was one of the worse movies I have seen. It was over acted by all actors, the story dragged on and on. I saw this movie for a bargain matinee and thought I was ripped off! The only good part was the comfy chairs and the half priced snacks!
Phoenix was so over the top and not in a good way. PHOENIX STOP DANCING!!! Deniro played another version of all the parts he has played in the past few years!
2 stars for the chair and 1 star for the snacks, -1 stars for wasting my day!"
"It seems like they were making a movie about psychotic killer clown and halfway during production decided to slap on a ""Joker"" title to make an ""origin"" movie about one of the most iconic villains of all time. They could literary change a couple of names and put the ""Depressed psycho killer clown"" as a title and it wouldn't make any difference. Well, at least i would give it a 5 out of 10 score. Maybe.Phoenix's Joker is stripped, sliced, diced, blended and strained to reduce him to only one of many aspects of character itself, insanity. Well that, and clown clothes. No other character traits Joker is famous, feared and loved for are there, and I just can't see them developing ever in this version of him. Even the movie itself is a slap to the one of the most important part of the lore and characterisation, Joker never truly revealed his true identity and even the three comic book versions of his genesis are probably all lies (well Jack Napier is just a shortcut for the story sake in first Keaton's Batman, movie-wise). Forget the deadly toys and gadgets, where are the genius intellect, prankster personality, wits, planning 5 steps ahead? True Joker is the driving force, this one is just a passenger in a cab (Taxi Driver pun intended). Joker would never pitty on himself, he does not laugh because he has a psychological condition and can't help it, he laughs because he is genuinely amused with all the terror and pain he inflicts, he IS truly a psychopath, not a person with some type of Tourette syndrome pushed in a world of murder and crime. And most of all Joker is supposed to be actually funny in his sick and twisted way, not only to himself (as Phoenix is) but to all of us. This is the first time i did not find anything funny in ones depiction of the Joker (well Leto's performance is a pretty good contender, but i won't judge him on the basis of 37 seconds of screen time lol, and even that was closer to Joker than this).As if you make a Batman movie where the Dark Knight is only left with his early fear of bats and mask with pointy ears, or the Iron Man where Tony is only a rich pompous jerk.And when Bruce Wayne becomes Batman Joker will be, what, 65, 70 years old?This movie doesn't work as an origin story, it doesn't work as a standalone (it's composed of only one really long act with a glimpse of a second one), nor as a part of DC in general. It is not an origin story we need, nor deserve, it simply isn't a Joker story."
"This movie is absolutely amazing!! Those giving it a bad review obviously have no clue what an origin movie is about. It is slow at first but obviously it's gotta work it's way up by telling us the story of how he became. Joaquin Phoenix doesn't disappoint in this movie, he nailed the role. I loved every bit of it."
"This movie represents everything wrong with Hollywood. Take an existing thing, make vast changes to it to the point it is no longer the thing it was, yet still call it the same thing to profit off its popularity.This story is of a loser at the end of his ropes. His life was sad, pathetic and he is powerless and thus...of course, lashes out at the world for it. This is a millennial's story. A person that blames everyone else, is a victim. There is no strength in this character. He isnt scary. He isnt a thing to be feared. This so called Joker, because he is without strength, knowledge could never be what the Joker actually is. Hard to kill, vastly intelligent and a criminal master-mind.Besides undermining every single thing that is the Joker's history, it makes a mockery of the Batman universe. This ""man"", who has no criminal history, cant fight worth a damn and is a low-IQ nit-wit, can just magically become not only Batmans greatest enemy, but can hold his own against the most powerful mob bosses and villains in the DC Universe. Why? Because he hates the world because his life sucked.Most at this point will have gone on about the deep psychological aspect of the film and claim that only a few can understand it...it is true. It is a deep psychological look at the mind of a professional victim that has failed at life and wants to burn the world because of it all while ignoring how it could never happen because a person like this could only hope to go out with a bang, literally as weak beta males can only hope to do, or ever do. It takes personal and mental strength to because a thing that gains power, keeps it, and uses it. That, makes this movie a failure on all levels other than acting. Which is supurb. Phoenix himself would make a great Joker, if he was cast to play the actual Joker.Sadly, this movie has missed the mark on coming remotely close to being like the character that is the Joker. Any incarnation of it. At least Leto was close to the New 52 Joker, enough that makes that role, more Joker than this one."
"Who is the crazier one?
The one who is able to adapt without contradiction to the conditions of a cynical, violent and morally corrupt time, or the one reacting on those conditions with uncompromising insanity, fighting back, using his own weapons of revenge, reflecting world's madness with an insane grimace?
This is the disturbing question the film poses in the figure of The Joker, equally fascinating, frightening and pitifully embodied by Phoenix, an unforgettable performance with great depth and a wide range of emotions: a Travis Bickle for the 21st century, and Robert De Niro himself paying tribute to this 43 years later after his own legendary performance in Taxi Driver."
"JOKER (2019) *** Joaquin Phoenix, Robert De Niro, Zazie Beetz, Francis Conroy, Brett Cullen, Shea Whigham, Bill Camp, Glenn Fleshler, Leigh Gill, Josh Pais, Marc Maron. Interesting but slightly bloated origin story of the arch criminal villain of The DC universe with Phoenix at the top of his game as the much-put-upon Arthur Fleck in Gotham City circa 1981 who reaches his breaking point and a moment of clarity of what his true significant purpose is in life with deadly consequences ensuing. While director Todd Phillips (who co-wrote the screenplay with Scott Silver) attempts to get in touch with his inner Scorsese by paralleling his worldview ala Travis Bickle and Rupert Pupkin (going full meta in even employing De Niro as talk-show host Murray Franklin) with far too many touchstones to count. Phoenix's chameleon-like physicality (shedding over 50 pounds) to give the slightly anemic/skeletal protagonist its spine by tapping into his own Christian Bale ala THE MECHANIC and his eerie, off-settling helpless cackle becomes instantly iconic in the canon of actors who've portrayed this homicidal harlequin."
"It was one of the best movies I have ever seen. The dark, tragic and well planned development of an innocent lonely man towards a brave symbol of awareness, resistance and revolution. Editing, soundtracks and direction was brilliant and breathtaking."
"Amazing story, writing and acting. A superb comic book and regular crime drama movie. It's the origin of Joker from Detective comics #1 in 1940 by Bill Finger and Jerry Robinson, the deep dive character study of Taxi Driver with story elements of Kings of Comedy.10/10"
"There is no reason for this movie to have been made. I went because of all the ecstatic reviews. Two hours of relentless blood spilling and gory murders. Giving the Joker this horrific backstory does nothing to enhance the Batman nemesis story. Joaquin Phoenix gives a silly, over-the-top performance. Robert De Nero is the only reason I gave this trash 3 stars. He enhances, but cannot save, this terrible movie."

"Morally, I dislike the depiction of mental disturbances relating to violence.Filmographically, this movie tries to ""terrorise"" the spectator. Strip it from the terrorising narative and violence, the only thing left is a use of mental disturbances."
I have nothing to say negative about this film. This movie shows the perfection in all aspects. leading actor done fabulous job. He will never disappoint U. Role of joker perfectly acted..
"I haven't sat through the entire credits in stunned silence since ''let the right one in"" baring no resemblance to this movie whatsoever I was left completely speechless as to what I'd just witnessed. The term masterpiece is thrown around alot these days but Jaquin's nailed on performance of one of society's forgotton tormented souls that inevitabley arcs into the fragile but brutal criminal psychopath we know as the joker is understatedley 'perfect' to a level where the viewer is left to almost encourage Aurthur's inevitable wrong doings and sucker you into morally second guessing yourself with 'is he actually doing wrong?'
I could go on but there are many other reviews for you to read that will say everything I would have said about the cinematography, music, sound,direction,set pieces, un-nerving tension, the violence, the twists and every other reason we love movies which Joker pulls off so so well.
If you've not already booked to see it just drop what your doing and book.
Just dont expect a superhero movie."
"An epic masterpiece. Joaquin Phoenix gives his best performance ever. Best comic movie ever and also one of the most favorite movie, loved it."
"Joker is one of a kind comic book movie. Packed with top notch cinematography and Phoenix's career best acting, this movie is the best to come out in years."
Phoenix is a best joker ever he deserved oscarThis is a best movie of this year
"JP has one and only acting register : the depressed looser, I don't understand the critics he is as mediocre as always. Save your money and re-watch Heath ledger's joker."
This movie is getting a lot of praise and this film deserves IMO its better than Endgame and The Dark Knight!!!
"Possibly the worst movie of the year
If Hollywood has to give an award to Mr. Phoenix is never late to reconsider another film that made.
why this film ?
why this character ?
Mental illness award ?
at the end of the film, you don't know if all is fiction of the disrupt mind.
SORRY TO PAID TO SEE THAT FILM"
"No need for Deniro's name in ads. Phoenix IS the show. I am angry at so many negative reviews focusing on ""the violence"". Can't this just be a story? Does it have to teach some lesson? Does this have to include a discussion about mental health? Can't this just be a ""making of story"" about the most iconic villian in any comic universe? In the last 15 min when Arthur ""becomes"" , I found myself raising my arms, yes! As i walked out, I felt like i wanted to drive home at 90 mph! I loved this movie. I loved this film. I loved the director. I loved Joaquin. I didn't want to join any cause. I don't want to change my life. But days later, I am still amazed what a great movie this was!"
My expectations for this movie weren't very high (DC just has been lacking lately) but man this movie is a masterpiece that has to been seen by all.
"Gotham City. Arthur Fleck works as a clown and is also an aspiring stand-up comic. He has mental health issues, part of which involves uncontrollable laughter. Times are tough and, due to his issues and occupation, Arthur has an even worse time than most. Over time these issues bear down on him, shaping his actions, making him ultimately take on the persona he is more known as...Joker.Great drama. While the movie fits into the Batman universe, and this could easily be seen as a prequel to Joker's character in The Dark Knight (where Joker was played superbly by Heath Ledger), this is not a comic-book movie. If it was a comic-book movie, it would have ended up another one in a long, seemingly endless line of them, one hardly discernible from the next.No, this is a human/psychological drama, and a very good one. Writer-director Todd Phillips creates a dark, depressing world with Arthur Fleck one of its primary casualties. The slow, inevitable progress of Arthur Fleck from innocent man to master-criminal is an interesting journey as Phillips rachets up the tension.What was then required was a performance that captured that darkness, helplessness and gradual disintegration and Joaquin Phoenix gives that, perfectly and spectacularly. Spot-on casting and delivery.Not quite the perfect movie though. Pacing was a bit off: some scenes seem dragged out too long. I know Phillips was drawing it out to create tension and atmosphere, but on a few occasions it feels like he overdoes it.It is also difficult, from a point, to be sympathetic towards Arthur Fleck. You start out supporting him, feeling that he is a victim rather than a villain, but, as his actions become more extreme, that engagement wanes.The story also feels like it is missing something to make it 100% complete. No, I'm not expecting this to link in with The Dark Knight. In fact, many of the Batman references actually seemed unnecessary, more there for audiences to gasp and say ""Oh, so that's how Joker fits in with Batman"", rather than adding anything to this story. A few scenes beyond the final scene might have been in order, to see more of Joker's history.Overall, still a great movie though."
"I have seen Jokers and this is not my joker. I know lots of reviewers gave this a 10 out of 10 score yet I almost walked out of the movie. It had no greatness for me. Phoenix did a great performance but it become too repetitious for me. Also, this guy had to have lost a lot of weight as he showed a shockingly thin body. I will say I enjoyed the credits at the end. The yellow lettering against the black background allowed for clean clear reading of all who worked on this movie. As the only dissenter in the reviews I am sure most will believe the others. Sorry just was not my cup of tea."
This was badly overhyped on all levels. Joaquin Phoenix whom I usually enjoy did not portray the man who became the Joker very well. Robert De Niro whom I normally love as well was just a twisted version of the late Johnny Carson. Worst of all was the directing job of Todd Phillips. He should not have taken on this movie. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME
"This movie won't be felt only by those who suffer and feel such feelings as the character does...
It need some ill people mentally or physically who suffered during there life time to appreciate it.
And from the rating I believe that a lot of ppl have experienced such circumstances hence the sympathy towards it."
"Wow ...what a movie and what an actor ,
Go ahead and watch it, it really worth it,
I've already seen it twice in three days."
"'Joker' is a sick, disgusting, dark, evil, violent, total piece of scheisse. It will seriously affect emotionally troubled young people already pulled at by suicide, addictive behaviors, and hopelessness. It's like a 'Triumph of the Will' for nihilists. I would defer from voting for Joaquin Phoenix for best actor until i see video of his normal non-acting self...it may be he wasn't acting in 'Joker' at all and is one majorly screwed up dude. And, what a weird alien body. He's naked from the waist up a lot in 'Joker' and, from the waist up, is, let's say, disquieting. All taut skin stretched tightly over an alien bone structure. The bones stick up and out at odd angles, in odd places, like the exoskeleton of a medical experiment gone wrong. Not a single pleasant moment in the movie. Not a moment of joy, nor beauty, nor happiness. No catharsis from all the misery and violence, just a stomach churning emptiness at the thought that the last fifty years have come down to this, and this is a circle of despair. A movie without hope, without humanity, showing a world that no sane person would live in."
"Going into the theater I already had a very high expectation, but it was no where close to how good this movie and the acting actually is.... This movie is an art piece."
"Casting was really good. No crazy surprise breakaway performances - everybody fit their parts and held their own (which is hard in the face of Phoenix and DeNiro).But the way the story unfolds, the foreshadowing, the grand revelations - absolutely masterful! Nobody would ever expect such good writing to be invested in a comic book villain origin story, but alas..."
"As heath ledger's joker said ""madness is like gravity all you need is a push"" Joaquin through his performance has proved it. Through the movie one will witness the fall of a man and the rise of the Joker. Brilliant performance by Joaquin."
Joachim Phoenix is the best. how can someone act so good. just speechless.
"JOKER review:
A brilliant movie. Outstanding Phoenix. Genius Todd Phillips. BEAUTIFULLY HAUNTING."
"If you go to see this movie expecting the villain from the Batman universe, you won't find it. It is however a great movie about mental illness. Phoenix obviously studied the character quirks of people with schizophrenia. But the Joker should scare you, this guy just makes you uncomfortable. It doesn't AT ALL explain how an awkward loner turns into a charismatic criminal mastermind."
One of the best movies I've ever seen. I strongly recommend everyone to look and enjoy in the awesome acting and story. Well done!!!
Amazing film and acting was superb. Could not have been better.
"Hello,Firstly, I would like to say I create for the very first time an account here. And this is my first review after watching the movie. Sincerely, this is the best best movie of the year, and may be of the century.Some time ago, when the movie about Queen came out, my opinion was the same, and not long after, the film won almost all the Oscars.Best,"
"I can't tell how I felt with every sense I watched,it was like take green cart to get in our deep side, and show us what is there! Jouqen is the most actor did his role in perfect way all the time. I watched movie twice before, and I'm waiting to watch it again"
"Well, this movie completely blew me away. I suppose it will remain polarising to audiences due to the subject material, and the way it is presented. But don't be fooled into thinking that this is merely a superhero romp, or some similar variation. The core of this movie is an examination of severe mental illness, depicting a horrifying condition largely from the perspective of the sufferer. You are also given a birds-eye view of the world that surrounds such an illness. The consequences to other individuals and the wider community are portrayed with frightening accuracy and honesty. An understated and carefully crafted subplot, serves as an origin story to the supervillain... Stylistically, the movie is homage to Martin Scorsese, and you can't miss the nods to several of his gritty pieces. As well, I'm sure I felt the influence of other films too, such as 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest' and 'Network'... Regarding Joaquin Phoenix's performance, I can't recall a more raw and gripping character portrayal. I reckon that this will come to be regarded as the definitive portrayal of severe mental illness by an actor on the silver screen. Phoenix has to be hands-down favourite for every upcoming major acting gong, and this is the best movie I've seen in a long time."
"This movie was outstanding. Don't trust the critics, this movie is a masterpiece. I expected it to be good, but it far passed my expectations, and in my personal opinion I believe he's better than Heath Ledger."
"Tragedy either brakes a man or makes a man. But the Joker's Breakdown is more than mere tragedy. At a specific point in the story, it's a conscience choice. It's when he makes that free choice that the viewer no longer feels bad for him. When you change your philosophy to match how you feel (in the case of the Joker, to make morality subjective) you attack what makes human dignity objectively good. An opponent to human dignity is not subject to sympathy. The Joker is evil.
This is a commentary on the ""victim mindset"" that we see in today's political-correctness. Batman is the contrast. His hardships make him want to spread justice. The joker's hardships make him want to spread more hardships."
"As one falls, another rises. The more I think about the movie, the less I have to say. This review was very difficult to write since I'd constantly get overwhelmed and lost in my thoughts. This film makes you think. A lot. It's the only thing I can think about and I can confidently say; it has 'scarred me'. The message it tells is relevant and very important since it's a realistic interpretation of where our society could end up. It's a warning which needs to be heard. Phillips makes an Oscar worthy, unique film. A film usually has high and low points which it fluctuates about. However, this film is steadily in the middle, creating tension throughout. Phillips makes the film fascinating and intriguing even though it's slow. The arc of Arthur is also organic and very well written since by the end you feel as if it was bound to happen. Phoenix's performance is also Oscar worthy since he is able to make us pity but fear him. Basically he's amazing. I'm still overwhelmed and trying to piece things together so that's all I have to say. In conclusion, it wouldn't be a surprise if it got a best picture and actor nomination. It's amazing and definitely one of my favorite films of all time."
"If you're here for a joker story this is not for you. It's a character development movie. The trailer tells you exactly what the movie is about. It's a bout Arthur Fleck becoming the joker. But that's not why it's great. It's great because Hawken Phoenix shows you how a person changes. Everything is rooted in reality and everything that happens is very beliveable not because what is actually happening is believeable but because Arthur believes it to be. This is a great movie that can be interperated to eternity. Director Todd Phillips really went for gold here. He created an amazing universe which this movie can exist in. You don't know if any of the things that happens really happened or if it's just in Arthur's head. Damn everyone should se this movie. I've seen it 3 times in cinema, but I want to see it again. It's just that good. It's art in its truest form."
"Wow, just WOW!Mindblowing performance by Joaquin Phoenix! Mindblowing movie!Nothing more to add."
"Probably the most intense film I've watched but maybe for personal reasons.
This film goes deep and can be quite uncomfortable.
The acting is sublime and the cinematography is beautiful but basic.
This film has left an everlasting mark on me, more than any film I've watched before, in good and bad ways.
It'll be a while before I feel comfortable to watch it again (but I will)Some of the low scoring reviews on here are hilarious and look like they're written by 5 year old who'd expected to an Avengers movie.
This film is massively thought provoking and is an absolute must for fans of cinema.Outstandingly edgy without being pretentious."
"As a kid growing up Joker was my favorite superhero villain and I always enjoyed seeing the different ways he was portrayed as. That being said, nothing tops this film. Phoenix gives one of the best performances of any film I have ever seen in my life. The writing is absolutely enchanting, dark, tight and extremely engaging. This movie blends psychological thriller, with crime mystery, and overall dark drama. The original score is about as perfectly made for a film as it can possibly get. Whenever it came on I notice the effect of the slow burn increasing suspense my heart rate would increase. The pacing in this movie is just fantastic, it flys by so quickly. I am still taking everything in, the symbolic elements, the meaning of it all and the ending especially the ending which is worth the price of admission. Joker is an extremely dark, and emotionally intense film that really is a lot to take in but it is so well done. Masterpiece!!!! Oscars make sure you watch this film and give it the awards it deserves!!!"
"When I went to the theatre to see this movie, I was expecting an ordinary movie about a DC villian. But what I saw was way, way more than that. Not only does it show Joker's origin but also shows how society treats people who are a bit different from them. Todd Phillips did an amazing job presenting the little details that show Aurther Fleck's degrading mentality. And the way the music and camera shots emphasises that idea is nothing short of remarkable. Joaquin Phoenix delivered an oscar-winning performance, which made the movie something I will remember for the rest of my life."
"Let's ignore the phenomenal acting, directing, script, filmography, special effects etc.. You could read about those elements anywhere else.People hate or worship the Joker movie for the same reason, on its superficial level, it glorifies the madmen, the lost, the pillars of capitalism that went astray and as a viewer you might do the same, asking yourself, should I hate the Batman now? No, you are not crazy.It seems that due to non-biological, cultural-related life circumstances, the only way that Arthur Fleck could fulfill himself is to become the Joker, a title that is a part of the movie's strongest underlying, Arthur didn't choose his destiny or his new name and identity, society's strongest did and it seems like there are many people like him or at least people that identify with him as seen in the street of Gotham in the last hour of the movie.I will watch this movie as many times as I watched Pulp Fiction, maybe more, and to think that there is only one significant character in it ( OK maybe De Niro's character is important, but they are all important)"
"The performance of joaquin phoenix is a masterpiece. If he doesn't get an oscar for this than I don't know wat is oscar worthy. You would't expect this from Todd Phillips, but he made a masterpiece."
Unbelievable how come we love the bad guy after living their own life
I actually really didn't want to like this film and thought I was going to find it awful to watch. Instead I found it to be brilliant. So deeply disturbing and had me on totally gripped throughout. Amazing film and so well done. I usually don't like Phoenix but he is so good in this and really gets it bang on. Thanks for making this film!
"Joker actually is a mix of different genres and elements who create something unique.
You can see the Taxi Driver or King of Comedy influences but Todd Phillips Movie has more things to say ... and Joaquin's Phoenix performance helps him to do that 100 %.
I think it's the best character development I've see in a movie and the screenplay it's artistic written. Even if doesn't follow the comic mythology at all and it's very realistic and less comic book movie, Joker has a lot of elements of Batman Mythology and gives some hint to DC fans. Dark, brutal, funny and sad at the same time ... Joker is one of the best movies of the recent years."
"I havent been this satisfied by a movie in a long time. There was so much depth and relatability. Joaquin did a fantastic job portraying such a real, broken character"
Saw it on opening day in Sweden and loved all of it.
"Great performances from all involved. Phillips is awesome with telling the story he wanted and leaving room for interpretation. Expressing his own feelings of society. Conveying it through the tragic story of a person having been beaten by society, now choosing the wrong path. Letting go and giving into his own sick and twisted perspective of the world that treated him so brutally. Returning the hate and anger bestowed upon him. It's sad and wonderful, mischievous and marvelous all at the same time. As an avid comic book, movie , joker, nerd. I felt Joaquin captured his darkness that grew from innocence to violence. His quirks and ticks are exactly what I imagined a live Joker to be, without being cheesy. you see him immerse himself into the madness that lives with the Joker and becomes apart of you as you follow the rabbit hole of the joker. Great stuff, fascinating approach."
"Focus on Arthur. This film is on point with what they want told. I've seen movies that deals with the same idea, but this is just a lecture.A very human society revolves around Arthur and sends him down a path full of conflicts and challenges. To understand why this representation of society can be considered normal, you have to see that this is what our contemporary generation has led to. Everything in this film is normal, normal because it happens and happened. We try to prevent it but its so normalized that it still happens. The problem isn't because of having either mental issues or normal issues, its the fact that we consider them two different things, and forget that the simple concept was to comfort the ones who are going through tough times, and just be there for them.We have opened a network of wrongs and it will keep on breeding more wrongs, until we choose to stop and do something about it."
"Joker's like getting in a time machine and going back to 1983 and watching a movie that was made without modern restraints to be thought provoking & entertaining, definitely NOT made to be PC, LGBT or appeal specifically to the Chinese or any minority. Joker was made for all mankind. The bought and paid for mainstream media critics will hate Joker, but true film fans will leave having seen something unapologetically original and unimaginably enjoyable. Joker resembles Taxi Driver or Platoon for getting in your head with brutal honesty and never leaving."
"I have to fan geek out on this FILM! It is simply one of the most perfect efforts in cinema ever. If JOKER does not rake in awards or more specifically multiple Oscars I will be befuddled! Joaquin Phoenix always delivers a masterful performance in all of his movies however this performance is truly magnificent. I was spellbound by him and by so much more. This music is phenomenal and high praises to Hildur Guðnadóttir!!!!! I will be seeking this brilliant composer to listen more of. Lawrence Shers' cinematography was beautiful and the film color/saturation was so spot on!!! KUDOS! Editing? Beautifully done!!!! Thanks to Jeff Groth and his team if he has one! I could keep singing about this movie but I will spare everyone....but damn, the man who brought it all together, director Todd Phillips. Masterful job!!!!! I wanted to stand up and cheer during the credits.... :) LOVED IT!"
"So I made an account and I am about to give my first ever movie review because of this film.I'm not a critic and Don't know much about the intricacies of cinema but what I can say is this is a damn good movie, I've never watched a movie so perfect before in my life. Honestly I thought this movie was gonna be a flop but I've never been so glad to be wrong.First off this is a terrifyingly real depiction of mental health, I have depression and was nearly in tears multiple times through this movie because I could feel everything that brought the character Arthur down. My favourite thing about this movie is the music, it's a truly scary score that blends well with the overall tone of the movie, every time you hear the music play you get an overpowering sense of dread and fear of what's about to happen. The violence hits hard but isn't over the top and makes you wonder what more this character is capable of. Never before have I seen pacing so perfect in film, it goes from 0 to 100 so slowly yet so quickly making you realise just how serious Arthur's mental state really is. The only thing wrong with this movie is the feeling of needing more!In the end Joker is the best film I have ever seen, it hits hard and leaves you wanting more from Joaquin Phoenix's exceptional performance that haunted my thoughts for days, I've been to see it 3 times now and my thoughts haven't changed. I truly hope to see this iteration of the Joker again in a sequel or even a cameo for any future projects. Hats off to the director and every person involved in this film, it was beyond perfect!"
"I always go to the one-star reviews first, as the ten star reviews of movies I like will just echo what I think. I like to see what someone who DIDN'T like the movie has to say - ""OK, convince me"".
The one-star reviews are hilarious - they range from the ""I'm different to everyone else!"" cries for attention to the jealous, possessive moans of those people who think that THEIR character or story has been taken from them and turned into something they don't like. Basically no-one convinced me - I didn't read a single thing that maybe think ""Hmm, maybe they have a point. I hadn't noticed that"".
For this is a perfect movie. Even to a superhero agnostic like me. The performance of Joaquin Phoenix beggars belief - from his physical transformation to the acting turn he puts in. I can't imagine anyone in the history of acting portraying this character to such devastating effect. I won't go on, because, as I said, it has all been said in other reviews - suffice to say that I'll be amazed if another movie tops this in my view in 2019. Once Upon a Time in Hollywood might have run it close with 20 minutes shaved off but as it stands, Joker reigns supreme, awards season notwithstanding.
I wondered why the left had took agin this movie, which is no more or less violent than many movies, superhero or no. (And speaking of Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, I heard someone on a podcast say they walked out when someone started inflicting violence on a woman. (This was a woman intent on slaughtering people, including an unborn child) So you waited till ten minutes from the end to stage your big protest!?) Then I found out. Apparently Todd Phillips said ""Woke culture has killed comedy"". Big mistake! The memo went out. The Hive Mind was apprised. Nothing he did was ever to be favourably reviewed again. Good. More room in the cinema for me."
"I have never in my life felt a movie like I did the joker. This movie is truly a masterpiece and it made me feel something I have never felt before. I cant stop thinking about the movie after I watched it yesterday I am just completely blown away. The music, the actor, the story.. Truly something else. My expectations were so high for this movie and the movie was far better then I ever imagined. Jesus Christ if you haven't seen this movie you are in for a treat. Im gonna go watch it again bye."
A Masterpiece thanks to Phoenix. I don't know whether they should make a sequel or not but this one is must to watch
"A genuine interpretation from Joaquin take us to feel the empathy and the deep pain he goes into.... amazing actor who transmit very well every emotion and stage he goes thru. Some people claiming the movie was odd, too dark and pacing but, in my opinion The odd and pacing on this movie was necessary for the public to understand what is mental illness. Photography, sound track and direction is delightful. Definily a must own movie, watched for second time already and I will many more. Bravo 👏🏻 and grateful for this movie, I do celebrate the success of this amazing film. Well deserved."
I was enough sure that this will give me some unforgettable moments but things get really amazing when i finally saw it and I was like i need 1 or 2 minutes to think about what was just happened in the scene. I mean how can a person go deep into these scene for some fraction of second and suddenly newer trench waiting for you. So unbelievable. Iam happy and thanks god to keep me alive so that i am able to see this cinema
"Incredible performance
Can strongly recommend the movie, even if you disliked the precious films."
One of the best film I have ever seen in my life 🔥🔥🔥
"I am not a fan of the dd batman universe, I am never interested, but they recommended the movie and I do not regret those 122 minutes I spent watching this magnificent piece of art. The direction, photography and lighting is brutal and accompanies the progress and development of the plot and the character. Phoenix played the joker spectacularly and magnificently, I loved his performance and I found the best selection. The development of the joker and his thankfulness is incredible, his important moments were well managed and he loved everything about him. Frances conroy great as always. If you did not see it, watch it, even if you are not a fan or have not seen other movies, just watch it, because it is not essential. One of the best movies of the year"
"This ain't no ordinary superhero movie. Never have I expected to tear up watching a movie especially in this day and age. The writing and character development is done extremely well, have I ever feel the pain The Joker goes through in this life. How his relation of his surroundings I compare to my relations with leftists elites like Silicon Valley and corrupt governments of western Europe to nihilists who infest the western world. That feel of wanting to change absolutely everything and how satisfying it would feel if you've actually achieve this stance of changing the landscape around you. Albeit my goals are a permanent renaissance, A permanent nirvana for the shreds of sanity of humanity, being the innocent ones, the ones unlike the ignorant normies and the scummy elitists who tear the world apart. Never have I expected a movie made in recent times have I ever felt shocked or uncomfortable in a good way. A movie to really inspire me especially at this magnitude is extremely hard to come across. Like The Matrix, it should really get you to grasp on an extremely interesting perspective of the world. A movie to really challenge you on what you perceive in life. This is one epic masterpiece if I've ever seen one."
"This film is far removed from the comic book capers one would initially expect. There is no superhero action sequences here. This is a psychologically thrilling yet disturbingly shocking version of The Joker, maybe a character study if you will.There is no falling into chemical waste in this movie; what you get here isn't a physical destruction of the character but a mental one. This could be a film of The Joker's psyche rather than his story.Phoenix's portrayal is nothing short of amazing. At times I felt like he may have tried too hard, but regardless this is an award winning performance and it's clear that he has thrown everything into this character both mentally and physically.Coupled with a beautiful soundtrack and amazing photography and direction this is a true masterpiece.Personally I'd rate this as the best entrant into the Gotham City universe so far. To follow this going to be insanely difficult.A movie that is, at times, cringeworthy yet still keeps you mesmerised. This is a sickly sweet, brutal and deeply dark and disturbing film. There is no good versus evil here; there is only pure evil. This franchise has finally come of age."
"As an avid movie watcher, I can't help but get bothered by the amount of people comparing the jokers from the latest film to the one in Dark Knight. Let me first clear the fact that I think Heath Ledger's performance in the dark knight set the bar extremely high for anyone that was to play the role again, this was clear from the miserable attempt by Jared Leto in suicide squad.The joker in the latest instalment is about how he became the joker and the revelations of his childhood trauma and mental illness, it's the back story to everything you've ever seen about a joker. It is stupidly wrong for anyone to compare him to the Joker from the dark knight, where we see a matured chaotic version, a finished product more or less.This movie was not supposed to tell you a story with a begging middle and end, it doesn't have a very sold narrative nor it's supposed to be a fast paced watch. There's nothing wrong with that and I honestly don't think that's what they were going for. It portrays his existing struggle with his illness, his failed career aspirations and the harshness of the society he's in. The movie is about him and him only, the uprising of the joker everyone knew before this movie.If you're still bothered by the story then let the cinematography and sounds effects sink in for a moment.My final opinion is about the acting, it is one of the most original and convincing roles I've ever seen in a film, every move combined with his body language, tone and that horrific laughter captured my attention, which gave me goosebumpsIf Heath Ledger was alive today, he'd most certainly be proud of Joaquin's acting"
"When you're at the beginning of the movie, you think that you've got it all figured out: Arthur's mental illness, Sophie and even his mom, but when you progress through it you start seeing things the other way; you start doubting everything and every theory you had about his life and his motives, was everything you saw really happening or was it just a product of Joker's crazy imagination, was he even there or was he in the Arkham Asylum imagining it all. That's the beauty of this movie - it makes you wonder. That's why I think that Joaquin Phoenix deserves an Oscar and that's why I rated it 10 out of 10. I could go on and on about how perfect and fitting was the music and choreography but let's just leave it at that. If you didn't already, go watch it and have your mind blown!"
"One of the best films since the Dark Knight trilogy came out. So incredibly profound that I left the theater appreciating it more and more as I couldn't stop thinking about all the subtleties in the script and acting that made it perfect. I've never seen another movie like it. Going to see it again soon and will buy the blu-Ray when it's released. I had high expectations and it exceeded them. Do not listen to the critics and do not think ""it's just hype"" go see it for your self and see how incredible this masterpiece truly is."
This movie is a really art work! It's amazing! The best of 2019! Joaquin Phoenix always be live in our hearts
"This was just brilliant! It's been a long time since I enjoyed a DC film. Got no words, Joaquin deserves an Oscar for his performance as the Joker."
Did the Critics watch the same movie as everyone else?
Thats the first time in my life i made an account here just so i can rate this movie 10/10
I made an account because of this movie. I loved every second of it. This is the best actor to ever grace DC I almost find it impossible to believe they'll keep the quality up after this movie. I laugh at the controversies surrounding this by people with no clue as to what mental illness is or lack the capacity to know the spectrum it covers. See this movie. You will walk away having been impacted by one thing or the other.
Best movie in 2019.Just watch it...really awesome..
"In my opinion this movie should be the example for future films, because it proved that good movies can be created without cgi. This movie contains a profound character, and plot. Furthermore, Joaquin Phoenix's play is exceptional, and his devotion for this role can not be ignored. I can recommend it to those, who want to know the origin of Joker."
"It's a masterpiece. Simple as that. Joaquin does the role of his life in this movie. It felt so real, Arthur really is a troubled man and boy did we get the perfect man to play him. The writing and directing is also amazing, Todd Phillips really makes you feel the Scorsese-Taxi Driver vibes. It's so dark and it makes you sympathize with Arthur when you really shouldn't in a way.I am going to watch it again, for sure. Easily one of my favorite movies of all time. This will be a classic."
"When I sat to watch the Joker , I was anxious because as a person I do not like comic book movies . It's just my taste . I really don't find those movies so important because most of the times , they do not transmit a message . However , my opinion changed when I viewed the Joker . Personally , I do not think that this movie is a comic book one . It is a drama that shows the tragic life of an ordinary individual , who is disregarded by the society around him . From a specific point of view , you feel sorry for him and you really want to blame the rich and powerful who have created a societal trap that helps them achieve their personal goals while ordinary people suffer every day . From another perspective however , you are scared and terrified by his reaction to all this misery that society brings to him . That's what this movie perfectly does . It creates a story that is split in two subjective realities . The distorted reality of Arthur Fleck that is influenced greatly by his mental illness and the reality through the eyes of the common people that blame his actions . It is a story that depends on how the viewer wants to see it . But I think that the story really shows the life of a man who did the wrong things and reacted in a psychopathic way to his problems , partly because of his mental illness and partly because of the pressure that was created by the environment around him . It is a story that does not justify this guy , but also does not accuse him . It just shows us that we , as a whole , sometimes create a Joker , without often realising it . So , for me it is a presentation of the two sides of the same story , those of an unstable and poor individual in a cruel dystopian city that does not care for people like him and those of the people with common sense . Additionally , it wants to tell people that they should take care of men and women who have mental problems and they should fight for a better world that does not treat the unprivileged so harshly as it does ."
Best of overall movie. I very don't know what to say but you really need to see this movie.
"Joker is absolutely brilliant. It's gritty and utterly captivating. It's a tough watch at times and yet you can't look away. I would not recommend it for the faint of heart, but if you love crime drama, 1970s movies, or very early Scorsese films you might enjoy Joker. The film is getting a tough rap from the mainstream critics, mainly because it's very divisive, but also because it shines a harsh light on some very rough subjects, including class warfare, access to health care, and the mental health crisis in America. If any of these things make you uncomfortable don't go see this film. As for my opinion, Joaquin Phoenix deserves an Oscar and so does the director. Yeah, it's that good.One last thing, the photography demands that you see it in the best possible quality. Also, for goodness sake, don't let your kids see this movie. This is not a Batman film. This is not a Marvel popcorn movie. It's a ""hard R"" crime drama."
"Some people say that it is too dark for their likings, and made them uncomfortable. That's the point of the movie. It let's you litterly stand in the shoes of a mentally ill man. If you don't understand the movie then you should probably not even review it because if you missed the movie's mark all what will come out of your mouth is bull bull."
What a performance by Joaquin. The way they build the character is mind blowing! Loved Heath Ledger but Joaquin has actually outdone him here...
"I'm not a fan of Batman movies but went to see this with my teenage son. It's truly one of the best movies I have ever seen. I have never felt a movie to be PERFECT, but this movie truly I s. They just don't make movies like this anymore with the perfect story, script, cinematography, score, acting! It will be revered as a cinematic masterpiece.
And I do appreciate the political statement it's making. It's not condoning violence. It's trying to reveal what harm mental illness which is ignored by society and even bullied and ridiculed can do.
Just saw it for a second time tonight! Will watch again!"
"What can I say? This movie speaks for itself. It's amazing, it's mesmerizing, it's dark, it's brutal, it's the best movie of 2019 hands down. At first we see the sufferings of the main character Arthur Fleck. Then we see his journey into madness and accepting his identity, Joker. The ending was magnificent. It's a movie you just have to see to experience how good it actually is."
In a time of over saturated comic book movies it's a beautiful irony that this is the film currently attempting to push boundaries in the genre and break out of the comedy infused entertainment formula we have had for the last decade is the one film about a clown.
"Even if you are not a fan of dark, psychological thrillers, there is no denying that Phoenix has set a whole new standard for the acting world. Phoenix portrays the joker like never before, leaving the audience to pity the character. I have seen the movie twice since it's release date on Friday, and can say with confidence that it is an instant classic for sure. It opens up new doors for film and actors. Arguably the best acting of the past decade."
"Not for noobs,
Pros are cordially invited.
The movie is based on the reality and the truth."
"I went in the movie expecting a basic/ straight forward origin story of the joker and how he would fit in the Gotham of this Universe. But I got something else, an experience like never before from a comic book film. After the first watch I couldn't grasp everything, but after watching it for the third time, there are so many things happening that you would not even think of are happening, or ask yourself are they even real? The more you watch this film the more it grows on you, makes you think about the reality. The movie doesn't end on a straight forward conclusion, but keeps the mystery intact, and is open to interpretation. My take on this one is that, this movie is not about the joker which we know from the comics and live action movies, but it's about a man who impregnated this chaos in Gotham which led to hundreds of followers from which the real joker was born who became the arch nemesis of the batman. Joker is not about who is behind the mask but about the chaos which still passes down and is beyond his death."
This joker Standalone movie is a Masterpiece and the acting of Joaquin Pheonix makes it Oscar Worthy. I think it would be unfair if this movie and Joaquin doesn't gets the oscar.
"But the 10 star reviews that came flooding in were too much for me to take seriously, and I was right.By all means, go see Joker - it's a standalone origin story that needs no knowledge of the Batman series, but it also rewards fans of that series with some very convincing details and very believable storytelling.I won't get into the plot, but there are some twists. Very well done, in fact, even though they are both reminiscent of certain M. Knight Shymalan films. Very tastefully done and expertly integrated into the storyline without overindulgence and quite important for the story and character arcs at play. Bravo in that respect.Also, applause for the cinematography, the style, the homages to previous classics and just the wonderfully realistic atmosphere that the director and his crew were able to bring to life here. Positively the most believable and realistic Gotham ever. Some might find that to be a veiled critique, but it makes this film watchable and enjoyable by those who have no knowledge of the Batman franchise(s).Just altogether airtight production and direction. Hands down.The only gripe I have is with the score - not the songs, necessarily, but the use of over-dramatic violin/cello passages and too-loud unnecessary (and very dark) orchestral pieces that almost take the audience out of the experience. Those who have seen it may know what I am talking about, but no spoilers.All in all, this is very much worth watching even if I feel as though it may spawn some copycats in real life - sure to have a long ""cult film"" life after it fades from the cinemas.7.5/10 with no caveats."
"I found nothing interesting or artistic about this movie, it's just a meaningless show which pretends something meaningful"
"If you haven't known already, this is an in-depth review of the 2019 movie Joker and it will contain a lot of spoilers. I strongly recommend you to check the movie out before reading this because it really is a masterpiece, and you should respect it by watching it in the theatres. I personally give this movie a full score as it really exceeded my expectations on all aspects of the movie. However, I understand that this movie is not for everyone. If you're more likely to watch action movies, then I don't think this movie will suit you. Here are a few criterias that I would like to talk about which made this movie an overall dark, disturbing and mesmerising masterpiece.First of all, let's talk about the cinematography and the score of this movie. It undoubtedly uses a bluish constrast to create this sort of a cold and chaotic city feeling in the early 80s or 90s, much like the movie ""A Clockwork Orange"". In my opinion, this is brilliant as it sets the mood for the movie that we're about to experience and the surrounding condition for a story that revolves around a man (Arthur Fleck) and his drastic descend into insanity, caused by the broken society. As this movie symbolises Arthur's depression, it is important to let the audience know and feel what it's like to be him, and how he view the outside world. The score in this movie is extremely phenomenal. I don't think this movie will give out such a big impact on me if this score wasn't there. What really surprises me is that you can actually feel Arthur's depression through the score, like it's secretly giving out information to you. The score gave the sort of impression where Arthur is a sad, depressed and miserable person inside a clown's body. Finally, I also think that the score serves as a signal which makes the audience feel like they are the joker. For instance, the audience is so used to hearing this music when something bad happens to Arthur that they will attach this music to a bad occurrence. As a result, supposedly a mentally-ill person is very unpredictable in some ways will be predictable now as the audience recognise the score even when something positive is happening. They kind of know when Arthur will finally snap.Secondly, let's dive into the story itself. As a summary, Arthur fleck is an innocent guy, working as a clown and a standup comedian who is driven crazy by the society. This character is portrayed by Joaquin Phoenix who, in my opinion, is one of the best actors working today. One aspect of the film which I thought is extremely brilliant, is Arthur's laugh. In previous Batman movies, the character Joker laughs all the time because they are psychotic and laughing pleases them in certain ways normal human cannot comprehend. This Joker, on the other hand, is the complete opposite. Arthur has a condition which causes him to laugh uncontrollably due to nerve problems in his brain. This, I have to salute to Todd Philips and Joaquin Phoenix for taking the risk to approach this Joker character in a different way, much different from any Joker films ever made. Every laugh, you can feel Arthur's pain and loneliness. This is very important to create and emotional attach for the audience to Arthur. I personally think that Phoenix can win an Oscar just from that laugh sequences alone. During the first act, we follow Arthur through his daily routines. He works, then he comes home to his mother. every day. This tells the audience that Arthur is still a normal human being and not some psychopath from the very beginning. Then, things get rough and he loses his job for dropping a gun at a children's hospital. There's the subway scene where he was physically attacked by a few Wall Street guys. Due to the immense pressure, he killed all three of them using a gun which was given to him by a colleague of his. Although we are suppose to feel terrified by all this, we feel a sense of victory and satisfaction because that is how Arthur feels after killing them. This is also the scene where the gap between Arthur and the Joker narrows down. There is also this scene where Arthur realised that he was imagining his relationship with a neighbour of his, which was revealed later on in the movie. Although some people think that the reveal of this scene should be at the very end of the movie, I still think that it is perfect where it is. By putting this scene hanging in the middle of the movie, it will cause the audience to not be able to distinguish what's real and what's not. They might be thinking, the past isn't real. But, there are still a few more acts in the movie. Are those still real? I also like the fact that the Murray Franklin Show is very realistic. For example, laughters can be heard when Murray says something that is funny, much like a real talk show. As a result, when Arthur kills Murray at the very end during the talk show, it creates a very disturbing but realistic portrayal of an interview gone wrong. The audience no longer sites Arthur because they are deceived by Arthur's choice and they no longer recognise the man they once sympathised for. The last act is simply extraordinary and I cannot put into words how amazing it is. This is the part I simply don't want to spoil because it is your own choice how the story unfolds. There are no correct or wrong answers to what really happened to Arthur at the end because the audience is the Joker in this sense.Lastly, i wrote this review in hopes that people take this movie seriously. This is not a superhero flick or any other sort of a trilogy. It's a stand-alone film and a character study of Joker. I sincerely hope that this kind of movies, although violent must be exposed to teenagers that are not the age of 18 as well. It's a very mature film and it can get teenagers nowadays to realise and be prepared for what's ahead of them. Do not fall into the wrong hands. Be wise and know how to manage your stress. If not, you're going to be like Arthur. That's what the movie is trying to say.That's all. I hope you find this review helpful."
"It's an absolute riot ! JP take a bow 👏Few scenes are just too good.The last scene where he talks about how the society treats him like trash.
The voice , the mannerisms are on point. Like a child who needs some love but has been deprived of it.I like the hospital scene where the drops the gun and puts a finger on his lips suggesting the kids to keep quiet about the episode.All these scenes still show that probably Arthur has some traces of innocence before he accepted the darkness inside."
"I loved the movie and believe it is one of my personal favorites ever, but many people are giving it bad reviews. This movie will please those who understand it and see the underlying messages, which makes it powerful, moving, entertaining, and real. But if you don't see the true meaning (or don't want to), it just seems like an unnecessarily dark and violent addition to the Batman ""franshise"". Another reason some people may dislike this movie and find it ""boring and too slow"" is because there is an extraordinary lack of CGI, which for me personally makes it all the better... and then some. If this sounds like a negative to you, please stick to The Avengers and don't waste your time, because you will. It's not cookie cutter, it's not a money grab, it's a movie that makes you think and can be perceived in many ways. Exceptional writing and a surreal acting performance turns this would-be great movie into something truly special.
There isn't a right way for Joker to be perceived, there is just a wrong way, and that's where the bad reviews come from, expecting something it was never meant to be, while missing/overlooking the greatness of this film."
So so good! Incredibly dark and intense. Brilliantly acted! The best film I've seen in a long time! Well done Joaquin!
"I personally loved the film but, let's be honest, you don't care what I think.
Why would you... you don't even know me.No, YOU want to know if YOU'LL like the film and are looking for signs (occasionally hidden deep inside an ocean of egocentric opinions) as to whether or not you will.The answers simple.If you want, or are expecting, ANY semblance of a ""comic book"" movie there's a good chance you'll be disappointed. It's not. And it doesn't attempt to be.The common comparison of ""If you like Taxi Driver, you'll love this"" is over-simplified yet astoundingly accurate.
It's true. If you're a fan of Taxi Driver, or similar films, you'll be right at home laughing (when you shouldn't be) along with Joker.The acting's outstanding across the board. Cinematography is absolutely fantastic. Everything from set design to editing add to the fact we now have another (rare) classic-in-the-waiting film that happens to draw from a comic book series."
"Best Joker adaption ever, everything dark you'd want from such a character and I smiled throughout! Well worth every penny. Perfect amount of madness and incredible soundtrack. I don't even have complaints I am very satisfied - I absolutely love the profoundness in it. Joaquin Phoenix and Health Ledger are the best Jokers we'll have. I really hope this get nominated for the Oscars I'd dance a wild jig! Also this is my 550th review which is really cool!"
"Amazing acting from Phoenix!!! Absolutely solid performance. The score was equally incredible. My only complaint was there was a lot of build up time to becoming Joker, not a lot of Joker time. I understand this is an origin story, I just feel that I wanted a bit more in the end. But all in all amazing movie, you must go see it!"
"All the props to the team that made this fantastic movie. I have no words to express how i'm feeling about this movie, it was shocking, terifying and beautiful at the same time. I had high expectations about this movie and it delivered! The only movie i was not mad that i paid to see it in theatre. I don't know who are those people that the news say they walked out of the theatre because Joker was bad, or too violet, but they have no idea what they are talking about. This movie is perfect, from every scene, the cinematografy, the acting, the lighting, and omg, the MUSIC. 10/10 Best movie i've seen in the last 10 years. Give it a chance, don't let negative reviews fool you, you should watch it and decide for yourself it it's good or no."
"The acting,the story,the music, and the cinematography it was all awesome it was perfect looking forward to seeing this movie again with friends and family🤡🤡🤡"
"Such a different kind of film it's hard to describe, but I'll try. Dark, twisted, humanly relatable, psychotic realism from the point of view of an impoverished society letting its citizens fall through the gaps. It's the perfect combination of uncomfortable, awkward, sad, and funny. I'm pretty sure I felt new untapped emotions without current names, like discovering a new species of animal. It's a work or art, not a super hero of anti-hero movie. Many will be disappointing, as a little of me was, but most of me was very very satisfied. Don't walk there with any expectations, just an open pallet and soak up the paint as it's brushed."
"Is it just me, or is it getting crazier out there?
Arthur FleckThat definitely feels true. Joker is set in the early 80s and is loosely based on the origin of the Joker (DC Comic character and arch rival of Batman). This version is written and directed by Todd Phillips (the director of The Hangover films...yep) and stars Joaquin Phoenix in the title role.Almost everyone has their opinion of the film and how they feel about it, so take what you can from them, but, this is what I thought of it.The Joker is a gritty hard hitting study of a man's decline into madness. Arthur Fleck is a lonely troubled man, who between caring for his ill mother and performing for kids as a clown, dreams of being a stand up comedian - his only problem, he isn't very funny.This sounds familiar and fans of Robert De Niro and Martin Scorsese will recall King of Comedy (1982) and the painful Rupert Pupkin having the same dilemma (incidentally De Niro plays the chat show host Murray Franklin whom Arthur adores). Unfortunately Arthur or 'happy' as his mother calls him is living in a world that just doesn't understand him, again sound familiar? Travis Bickle from Taxi Driver (1976). Clearly these two films have influenced Phillips and he borrows seamlessly from them, but this is not in the same calibre as these, it stands alone.The central performance from Joaquin Phoenix delivers the punchlines (sorry). His lean skeleton holds the meat of the film (sorry again). He is mesmerising, he portrays sadness, depression, anger, loneliness and happiness brilliantly. It's a masterclass on acting, he lives and breathes the character.The supporting cast is good, Robert De Niro, Zazie Beetz and Frances Conroy to name, watch out for Glenn Fleshler (Remus from Boardwalk Empire) and Brian Tyree Henry (Paper Boi from Atlanta).The music is standout, Icelandic Hildur Gudnadottir sets the right tone and style to the film (to be noted she did the music for this and Chernobyl at around the same time). There has been some subject of debate for one music choice and I don't why that particular piece of music was used when others could have been selected, perhaps Phillips was wanting the reaction? (jerk). The cinematography is good and adds grittiness to the screen, the makeup is good too, I like how Phoenix has adopted a different clown paint - slightly reminiscent of Doink the Clown from WWE though).The film is rated R so be prepared to see violence, however there are probably less deaths in here than in most of the Marvel films, yep, and when it happens you can feel the magnitude of it.I would still recommend seeing this (unless you have coulrophobia) and making your own mind up on how you feel about it, one thing is for certain you will be talking about it for some time, which is what Phillips probably wanted - 'send in the clowns...they are already here'."
"Hildur Guðnadóttir thank you for the amazing soundtrack!!!
Joaquin Phoenix is outstanding. The Joker from a completely different perspective.
He laughs and at the same time he can show all kinds of emotions with his eyes.
Just incredible."
I'm 47. I've been around. I've been to the cinema a LOT. Never been to see a film twice though. Joker I've seen 3 times it is THAT good. Well to me anyway.
"I couldn't care any less about comics and I went into this blind without knowing about any of the hype expecting a ""meh"" movie. This is now my favourite movie of all time. It is one of those movies that makes you want to run back home to search for any scenes that might be available on the net and re-watch them again and again. Every scene is so powerful, gripping and fresh. The music, acting, dancing and cinematography is mesmerising. ""Joker"" is a masterpiece."
"This masterpiece of a film shows how, one sort of small Director and one of the best actors of all time can come together to make a movie that reflects society in the past but also today in some of the worst ways possible.
With the director, Todd Phillips, that did movies like the Hangover and Old School he shows that not only can he make very funny comedies but also a dark and serious period film. He's camera work throughout the entire film with over the shoulder shots and tracking shots of characters show how much he cared about the style and the feel of the 1980's Gotham setting.
The stand out of the entire film was Joaquin Phoenix's performance of the titular character of The Joker, but it doesn't feel like he is playing a Joker that we have ever scene before. We know the look of him and we know what his name is but his back story and many unique aspects to the character such as his laugh, and his voice are very different. Joaquin Phoenix seems to know that he is playing Arthur Fleck more than he is playing The Joker. By losing 50 lbs and learning dance moves and practicing the laugh of people with Pathological Laughter shows how much he cared about this role and the challenge it took for him to become The Joker and Arthur Fleck.
This movie as a whole is a period film and a character study. It shows how society is today with corruption and looking out the little guy. It shows how people can be treated so poorly and not cared about. It shows the dangers of what can come when things are slowly taken away from a person in their life. It also shows how mental illness can affect a person and their outlook on life. One quote is ""what do you get when you cross a mentally ill loner with a society that abandons him and treats him like trash?"". This perfectly sums up how society can warp the mind of someone especially someone with a mental illness.
This movie deserves all the praise it's getting and will hopefully be talked about for years to come."
"Hands down. Oscar worthy on many fronts. Phoenix really raised the bar on Joker with a stellar performance. Critics are out of touch, partisan, narrative pushers who couldn't review anything objectively if their life depended on it. Off to their beloved gulags with them and into the cinema you go."
"See. Its been such a long time since there has been a movie which is not supposed to make you feel happy or just give you moments. I am so happy that I got to witness this and see it. It will hit your soul. It will make you ask questions. It will make you think so hard, which is something we don't get in movies anymore.
Also, even though this is called ""Joker"", I hope people don't forget about Arthur, because I think that's what's important. The journey of Arthur to whatever he becomes.
I am glad I am alive in 2019 to witness this masterpiece."
"Everyone is talking about how violent and disturbing this film is... well, what's violent and disturbing is the REAL WORLD out there!!! American politics must change!! That's the message!! That's the films critic to society!! Mental health needs to be addressed!! Guns must be regulated!!Congratulations to the team who make this masterpiece possible and without any doubt the best performance of Joaquín Phoenix in any roll and the best Joker characterization of all time."
"Firstly if you are a cinema fan and appreciate the way a story unfolds; camera angles; character development then GO and see this movie! You will enjoy it immensely.
Now I had high hopes for this movie. Phoenix is an incredible actor and all the early reviews looked great. What I wasn't prepared for was the emotional connection I had with such a dark piece of film. The way you are drawn in as a viewer to the plight of Joker's character is fantastic. The set created a real feel to a 'comic' movie which is often missing. The story is actually close to the bone when you look at modern society; this only adds to the brutality. Fantastic film with all the right elements and casting. You will hear people say this movie is too dark but that is the exact reason the movie works so well. I would be surprised if Phoenix was denied an Oscar nod. I would say this is the best movie of 2019 so far. Bravo to the team behind JOKER."
"One of the best movies this year and pay attention, this is not a super hero movie. Joaquin performance is outstanding but it's not as good as heath's one.
It's one of those movies that it's totally worth it to go see it on a cinema. The intense songs when gooes louder it makes a good and dark feeling into it. A fantastic movie, and an incredible performance by Joaquin."
"Joaquine Phoenix is a Gem when comes to this joker act,he definitely deserves Oscar award for this movie must watch movie"
"Phoenix really did this role with a new style. It's REALLY PERFECT... Pheonix roll is CRAZY! I am a Joker top fan and I really loved it. The plot is amazing, and most importantly the message! Now Ledger is a thing and Pheonix is another. Everyone of them has his own style and taste. We can't compare them they're both great."
"If I have to speak about acting after you have scrolled down the star cast section, I would do a disservice to the actors and the director.So, we would talk about the outstanding story, wonderful script writing, surprising cinematography and marvelous character development- things that we do not talk about that often.
This movie shows how you can make a Shawshank Redemption kind of film from a comic book character.Make Todd Phillips the creative head of DCEU and you will have more such masterpieces."
"This movie is nothing but showcase of Joaquin Phoenix acting skills. He took whole movie on his shoulders.
And That laugh. You will get goosebumps, everytime he laughs."
"I truely hope Joaquin Phoenix wins an oscar for this.
What an incredible performance.
The movie has a very dark atmosphere from the beginning til the end.
You also sympathize with the joker, you feel sorry for him.
This is not a hype, this is a masterpiece. Go and watch."
The ending gave me a straight minute of goosebumps the story is spot on the acting is just wow i cant rate this at 10 as it deserves more i hope we can get joker 2 with the same actor he was super great. Great movie with great music.
Phoenix provides the best acting ever. It's not the movie of the it's the movie of the DECADE.
"This movie will affect you. It speaks to society, it speaks to the human condition, it speaks to our darker instincts. It's gritty, human, and in some small way profound.It's beautifully shot, artistic, very well acted, the the score is absolutely effective and well done. I don't rate this 10 lightly. It's not a film to be merely entertained, but it is a ride, and it's a film to talk about. See it, it's rare something like this comes along."
"Joaquin Phoenix transform to the joker
Best actor in 2019Amazing ending and no stupid girl clown to ruined the movie hope for joker 2"
Do I have to say more? It's everything I thought it would be. This is tye jest movie of 2019.
"Joker. Where do I even begin. Never expected a comic book movie to talk about such serious issues that we face today in the world. Mental illness, social economic disparity, social service funding being cut and how mental illness should be treated and what role we play in helping mentally ill people and how they're treated. The best part about Joker is that it never takes a position on these issues, all it does is show us what it's like and holds a mirror up. And that's it. It leaves so many things open ended for the audience to perceive. It's a dark, moody psychodrama which is elevated through Joaquin's performance, Lawrence sher's cinematography and Hildur guðnadóttir's haunting score. Tod Phillips also directed and wrote the film very well. The writing did drop in quality in some scenes during the third act which was one of my only flaws I had, but I'm not getting into spoilers. Watching Joker is a surreal, out of body experience. Some scenes for example the 'bathroom dance' is like being in a hypnotic trance where you don't even wanna blink while watching. And these are just my thoughts on the film, Either way, go watch joker. Support risky films like this that have something to say."
"Joaquin Phoenix's acting is heartbreaking and horrifying; he gives a tremendously physical performance and it is easily up there as one of his best.I found the film astounding: the cinematography is beautiful, the pacing is flawless, the tension builds to breaking point. The whole film comes together brilliantly in a character study that is so believable and gritty that I held my breath the whole way through.I know this review is coming across as gushing, but honestly I cannot imagine how the character could have been portrayed any better. It might be my favourite Batman movie to date, and the Batman is not even in it! I hope this movie is a taste of things to come for the franchise; it makes the Marvel universe look trivial and childish."
"Forget about the critics! They always bash DC for being too 'dark' and, in this case, for promoting violence and mental illness.Enough with the lame joke-infested Marvel type of movies targeted towards kids. The world needs to appreciate the more serious movies that tend to focus on crucial cinematic elements (in particular, plot and character development).This film is no where close to boring as it really shows you the Joker's transition whilst emitting a disturbing vibe that will leave you cringing simply from Joaqin's phenomenal acting."
"The movie is very good. A unique story, and Joaquin Phoenix is absolutely superb and definitely on par with Heath ledgers performance in the dark knight (2008). While the movie is slow in parts, you are always on the edge of your seat. Amazing film. Would love to see Joaquin as the Joker again! Nothing but a 10/10"
"Such a waste of time and money. Boring as hell..!!
If it would be possible I would give it -10!!!
Overrated....!!!!
I guess all because of paid reviews."
"This movie shows the true origin of the joker that has never seen before in cinema. I went in expecting non-stop action. But I was wrong, it is more subtle and takes important aspects from the source material. JP's acting is incredible and the trans-formation from Arthur to the Joker is portrayed remarkably well. The laugh he makes added with a great selection of sound and style of the movie makes it that much creepier. You sort of feel sympathy for Arthur and what he's been through even though, he is committing terrible acts of violence. There is elements of dark comedy which blends well with his character. The plot is strong and the director has done a very good job. This stand-alone movie pays great tribute to previous installents and will be go down as one of the best DC movies ever made."
"Joker (2019) is ambitious, tragic, meritorious, a dark comedy, exhilarating, and a masterpiece in cinematic storytelling. Director Todd Phillips, after several questions over his ability to direct a praiseworthy Joker film, delivers a classic movie that will be forever enshrined in the memories of those fortunate enough to experience it. Phillips deconstructs the superhero genre and turns it on its head, forming a film that feels and IS an artful indie film rather than a prototypical A to B superhero movie. Every scene in the film has purpose for Phillips. There is a love for the story being told and a direct care in the manner it is portrayed. And for this Phillips should be praised. He navigates the complexities around the character of the Joker, introducing a fresh take while also attempting to pay homage to movies such as Taxi Driver and King of Comedy. Yet, the movie never falters, not even for a second. It moves through each scene not just feeling new, but breathtaking beautiful that will have you applauding before the credits even roll.Likewise, the details in this film are remarkable, as Phillips not only has one listen to the film, but we actively live in it. We can feel the nasty, garbage-filled streets of Gotham often represented through careful and strategic use of symbolism. But of course, while the movie itself is remarkable, it needs an anchor - the great Joaquin Phoenix.Phoenix delivers the most jaw-dropping performance in a film of the 2000s, and perhaps one of the greatest and most memorable performances of all-time. While the character already complex, Phoenix dives so much into the role that you can hardly recognise him. He is at times funny, delicate, innocent, sometimes he is tragic, heartbreaking, and at times he is the dangerous, horrifying, and unpredictable. Through his complex play on the ranging emotions of one Arthur Fleck, Phoenix becomes the epitome of the Joker.So is this the best comic book movie of all time? For most moviegoers that will be the question. And this film transcends the genre in a manner that has not been done since 2008. Likewise, while the Joker movie is more of a tragedy or even comedy than it is a superhero movie (imagine an indie film with DC characters), with the inclusion of superheros, or supervillains in this case, it will always be a superhero movie.So where does it stand amongst other CBMs? It is top 2, battling with another film that featured the Joker, The Dark Knight."
"I had heard bad reviews from critics on this film but after deciding to go see the film, I do not regret seeing it one bit. The story telling of this film is something the film industry is lacking these days."
"Joaquin""s performance was over the top perfection. Want 2 C it again for things I missed!
OSCAR...absolutely! Amazing!"
"So this was well promoted on every social net you could think. So this was told to be the best flick of 2019, So many things were said and so I was afraid it was overhyped.Let me tell you, not one bit. First of all, happy to see Robert De Niro back in a flick that suits him. No more comedies please Robert. Secondly, the comparing all over the net between Ledger and Phoenix. They are both excellent in their own ways.The movie itself. Starts off rather as a normal flick, except for opening credits which took me back to the old WB logo's and yellow lettering of the seventies, but quickly turns into a dark movie getting darker and darker and more and more insane. The way it was shot, the score my God, really well done.And then there's the performance that couldn't beat Ledger. Well, Ledger I do still like as the Joker but what Phoenix did as the sart of the Joker is really really worth the Oscar. The skinny body, the laughter, the sick looks. with De Niro in it it did remind me of Taxi Driver who one person can turn from a desperate person into a mad person.Towards the end I was thinking, okay, so far 10 out of 10 but are they going to ruin the link towards Batman. They didn't, the last 15 minutes, man, it fits perfectly into the Batman world.It's been a while I have seen such a flick, and after some Marvel rather boring stuff (Avengers Endgame for example) again I was shown that DC is my thing.I can go on and on. The impossible mission to beat Ledger, well, the Oscars will proof that it has been done.Be warned, rated 16+, totally correct due the brutal action and the downward spiral of the storyGore 0/5
Nudity 0/5
Effects 0/5
Story 5/5
Comedy 0/5"
"I will never listen or read to critics. For the first time in my life, I didnt want a movie to end. Time was not enough, I wanted to see more of the Joker."
"A true tragedy that shocks at every turn. Watching a broken man fall further into brokenness and eventually madness. Phoenix gives an unforgettable performance that brings the Joker character to life in a visceral and gut punching way. Along with a horrifying score and beautiful cinematography, Joker is one of this years must watches."
"Ok, nobody can beat Heith Ledger.. But Joaquin Phoenix does the Joker extremely well. I've been waiting for a movie, dark and serious as the Dark knight. I've been longing for a movie that isn't like all the marvel comedies, a movie that feels real.The Joker is effectively shot, the story is perfect and the acting is genius.What I like most is that the Joker is still a mystery, Todd Phillips did not destroy the character. He developed him.The movie is obscure but still so clear, this is one of the best movies made.
The fact that people are worried about mass shootings just strengthen the fact that the movie is exceptionally well made. (of course it does NOT promote violence, it just shows how dark violence in fact is, unlike for example Deadpool.)
If I wasn't clear enough, see the movie, yesterday."
"The masterpiece behind Joker is multifaceted, which is exactly why it is a masterpiece. It has flawless acting, perfect directing and real, gritty revelations of real life. If anyone thinks this movie is bad because it suggests we should feel empathy towards Arthur despite his evil actions, they are part of the system which caused this trouble in the first place. Mental health does not exist in a vacuum; it is interrelated with a society and a system which does not care for people with disadvantage. Crimes rates soar and the community demands protection and justice; justice is served by detention and alienation. The cycle repeats itself until society is tricked to believing that there is a singular person to blame, but the imperfections of the system and lack of support from society is creating more Jokers than one movie discussing its subject matter. For this reason, Joker is bold, novel and technically perfect, it is a movie for the Ages, akin to that of There Will be Blood and Taxi Driver. It is a character study like no other!"
"Let's just get this straight......if Joaquin Phoenix does not win an Oscar for this performance than there is something wrong in the world. As for the movie? Disturbing, thought provoking, fascinating, inciteful and just brilliant. A comic book movie that's not a comic book movie. I never thought Heath Ledger's performance as the joker could be matched but Phoenix's version is simply outstanding."
"This movie is as dark and morbid as they come. Don't expect this film to have anything to do with Batman or even the joker. They could've just made a film about a random person that struggles with mental health issues and it would've been a winner. Yes, it's a film about how the Joker came to be but for me, it was more than that. There's a much darker yet relatable story that it tells. It's almost a documentary about the very real illness that MANY of us face but are too scared to reveal until breaking point. The addition of the Joker, well, that's just a bonus. It's not often that a film can make you sympathise with the villain especially after some of the gruesome acts he does, yet, somehow by the end, you can't help but be on his side which actually makes you feel a little uncomfortable after the movies over. Brilliant film, incredible acting and certainly plays on your mind for a while after."
"I always thought of Joker as a evil demonic clown who loves terrorizing people to get his rocks off.And I always wanted to see a really cool back story for him to see what turned him evil but this just blew me away.never ever has a movies protagonist/antagonist made me feel so weird inside how is it it possible someone can be so evil and yet we can sympathize with him ,such a weird feeling I can't stop thinking of it.Brilliant cinematography ,score ,acting ,story ,twists & everything.10/10"
"Growing up I've seen all the iterations of the Joker character. From small screen to big screen. All of them are unique in their own way. Don't compare Phoenix to Ledger as the two Jokers are simply two different interpretations of the same concept. This is the story of the Joker from the inside out. There are no punchlines, no gimmicks and no silver lining. There is no hero in this film. This is a study on the concept of the Joker and how he became who he is. This movie is dark, terrifying, introspective and raw. Phoenix simply disappears in his role and you never wonder where he went. Everyone knows that the Joker is insane but never have we ever seen inside his mind like we do here. From top to bottom this film is a masterpiece in every sense of the word. Phoenix has already won the best actor Oscar. It's just a matter of time before they hand it to him."
"Why can't the producers of Batman movies make it as good as this movie? Like it was on Dark Knight. DC should learn from the success of this move. Stop tryin to be like Marvel, have your own style, dark, gloomy and thrilling."
"This movie is an intense dive into our dysfunctional societies that has taken a turn for the worse.
To think the director behind such absurd film like Due Date and Hangover (Not that anything is wrong with those films) would even be willing to make this film in itself is amazing.
Joker puts our ugly side under the spotlight and makes you wonder where does a society draw the line.
Those that have watched the Swedish film The Square know that this is a concept that many film makers have worked on for so many years.
Joker is just the darkest side of this story and question.
this line the I am talking about is not the line of justifying the character of Joker but the line that eventually leads to making a person like Joker come to life.
This movie constantly paints that picture, where is the line?
Where do you put a stop to it?
How could you have prevented this from happening?
The movie opens with a clearly already broken man prisoner to the society and the system that is not willing or able to help him.
Joker's situation is already beyond dire and further down the line you learn about all the happenings that lead to this broken man.
The film maker and the actor never paint a heroic picture of Joker, he is not glorified by the movie.
He is presented as the byproduct of a society that is eerily familiar.
Because whether we like it or not we all are responsible for one another.
We all affect each other's lives in ways that we can never imagine and psychological health is to this day a subject that is scoffed at even by the brightest and most free thinking people.
No one likes to see where the monster comes from because we do not want to have the blaming finger turned on us.
We just want the monster among us shunned, chained and caged and hanged.
It is a fact that our failing societal relationships are leading to psychological illnesses and in extreme cases to violent outbursts.
Most of these outbursts are introvert and almost nobody pays any attention to them but the extrovert ones are always scoffed at when doctors talk about the need to study and understand them.
This is the world that creates Joker which is portrayed and criticized here.
Leaving that subject behind lets talk about Joaquin Phoenix.
This man is a wonder.
I have followed his work through out the years watching him as he evolved with every movie he played and today when you watch Joaquin play Joker you see him through out his career.
You see him in Gladiator, you see him in Ladder 49, you see him in Her.
He has grown with every movie to the point where he creates this amazingly authentic performance for the audience to take part in.
From the very first line, the mimicry, the slightest movement he is the character that he is portraying and he is Joker by the end of the movie.
You can hear this pained and sick man, you can see his break point, you can feel his struggles and that makes this performance just exceptional.
I am not going to even compare this performance, it really is an entirely different beast and by far one of the best performances I have seen in the recent years and easily the best Joker performance to this day.
Lets go into the music...what can be said except intense?
Something that I loved was the music choices, they really did convey the world's personality to me as audience.
From the jazzy tones of the New York city life (as we know Gotham is basically New York and Chicago mixed into an unholy union) to the musics chosen to deliver the mood of the scene or character it felt really fitting and good.
Then we come to the original sound track and we are basically dealing with a drama horror or thriller soundtrack with suspenseful moments and intense moments that makes you sit straight in wait for the impending explosion of events.
This is Joker, every camera shot, every movement and every sound is there to make you wait for the right moment that it goes ""BANG"" and puts something new on your lap and this movie has several of those.
This is Joker, a movie that studies what elements in a society can lead to the creation of people like Joker and Batman and in my humble opinion this movie delivered on this at every front possible.
I wholeheartedly recommend watching this movie to anyone that is a fan of Cinema and good films in general."
Really good plot and GREAT acting just extremely dark
"Oscar for Joaquin !! Such an epic movie, Joaquin is truly Joker"
"Everything about this movie is perfect,if Joaquin Phoenix won t win the oscar I will stop watching movies."
ANYONE THAT TELLS YOU THAT THIS FILM IS ULTRA-VIOLENT OR PROMOTES GUN VIOLENCE IS LYING TO YOU.Amazing film. MASTERPIECE. A slow simmer to a rapid boiling over the pot great piece of story telling.
"Joaquin Phoenix is amazing and in Joker you get to see his real acting material, he's amazing he's great he doesn't hesitate to give it his best and more. Joker movie is the best 2019 movie so far and probably in most recent years, from directing to the writing to the acting to the score, we were mesmerized the whole time, i give it 100 over 10, an American classic that will be talked about for many years."
"One of the finest movies ever made.
Best acting performance ever.
Best story telling ever."
"This movie has to be one of the best acting performances I have ever seen. Joaquin Phoenix deserves an Oscar, without a doubt. The amount of work that he put into this film paid off. Such a dark and creepy movie. Will definitely be going back to theaters to rewatch. Loved it!"
"Holy hell this turned out to be a good movie. Really enjoyed it in the theaters. One of the few comic movies where you actually start feeling something for the main character. The empathy is born from the good writing and the phenomenal performance of Joaquin Phoenix.The only thing mildly bad stuff about the movie -which isnt an issue about the movie- are the trailers. Dc did it again with the ""lets expose almost every scene in the movie with trailers"" mindset. Dont get me wrong the first teaser with the ""Smile"" piece was really cool and got me hyped for the movie. But it felt like I kinda knew what was gonna happen already. I dont mean the whole scenes itself but where Arthur is gonna in the next scene and stuff.Even if the trailer kinda ruined my first watch I whole heartedly recommend this movie to everyone."
"This is one of the most overrated movies ever. Once again, Joaquin Phoenix's creepy weirdness totally overshadows everything else in this film. He's so desperate to make this his own character, that he makes the whole film awkwardly uncomfortable and unenjoyable to watch. I'm not sure what character he was supposed to be, but it sure wasn't the joker. He was just a creepy guy in a clown costume with extensive psychological issues. Skip this garbage."
Best story in the year .. The joker will win the best film in the year ..
"I understand why people are excited for this film and I'm afraid it's clouded everyone's judgement. There are some insane flaws in this story regardless of it being an original origin story. While trying to pull from such films as King of Comedy, Taxi Driver and Fight Club to attempt at bringing a fresh look at The Joker there is 1 major glowing flaw in everyone face that I have yet to see anyone talk about.
In any origin story you bring to the character the Joker it all leads to the same road, an enemy in Batman. We can all agree on that, without that regardless of origin story you have no Joker character at all.
So explain to me how Arthur being at least 30 and that's being kind because let be honest, he looks no younger than 40 in this film, is going to fight Bruce aka Batman who we see him interact with at the age of at the oldest 12. By the time Bruce would become Batman the Joker will be pushing 65/70.
The film is lost the second we see Arthur and Bruce on screen.
Had this film been a story about a young boy who was troubled and saw Arthur character this inspiring the Joke I would have loved it. Unfortunately it's not and everyone seems excited to see Batman fight a Joker in a wheelchair with this origin story.
Heath will forever own this role and the character should stop there."
"This film was too long, too slow and too dark and unnecessarily violent. It was disturbing and uncomfortable to watch. I will give credit for the music selection.Somebody give Joaquin Phoenix a hug and a Xanax."
The best film I've seen in a long time! Absolute amazing!!! Definitely recommend to go & see it! Would definitely go & see it again!
"I made an imdb account after watching this movie. It was that terrible. Watching Joaquin Phoenix do interperative dance and try really hard to play an effeminate mentally ill person. The change into the Joker never felt earned. The movie itself was predictable and forced. A try hard edgelord masterpiece. Surprised he wasn't wearing a fedora. This movie just doesn't get the joke, because it IS the joke."
"Good acting but the most boring film I've seen in a long time. I was expecting a slow burner but Jesus Christ, the good scenes in no way over shined the rest of the film and when he finally became the joker he played him like a camp 3 year old, complete pretentious American garbage. Ruined the character for me, hope they never do a sequel."
"One of the best movies I've seen in my whole life. This movie has a lot of levels. The psychopath construction is uncomfortable and attractive. It brings an invitation to ask ourselves if the concept of ""good and bad"" makes sense. Because all of us have the potential to become monsters when we're not able to control nor understand our own demons. But only some can exploit their true nature by being precisely a monster. And that keeps me thinking about the bravery and its shadows. It's a movie that hangs onto you and assaults some proper ideas during a burst of laughter. Joaquin Phoenix does an unbelievable job, he's one of my favourite actors and his work impressed me deeply. Incredible art direction, the colours and photography are the perfect apology for Mr Todd Phillips's masterpiece.Incredible and captivating."
"I am typically a fan of what Marvel has done, and initially saw no point to this movie when it was announced and couldn't see Phoenix doing the role justice, particularly after Heath Ledger's brilliant take on the Joker.
How wrong was I? This movie starts slowly, and draws you into Arthur's world without you realising it until you can't look away from the screen for fear of missing a single second of it. It is raw, it is personal, it is disturbing, it is sad, and it is deeply resonant of some of the troubles we are experiencing today in the world. This is the Joker, arch-nemesis of Batman, yet you feel empathy for him, and can't completely disagree with his actions. He only hurts those who he perceives hurt him, even if his justice is fatal and doesn't befit the crime. ""Wrong me, and you are dead,"" is not justice, and each of his victims display their own weaknesses and frailties, and aren't inherently bad people.
This is a brilliant movie. One of the few I went back to the cinema to watch again. It deserves Oscar recognition for Phoenix, Todd Phillips, cinematography, and the score.
Congratulations all round!"
"A very dark movie with superb Acting and Cinematography. I felt all kinds of emotions all throughout the film. Laughter, Pity, Aggression, and finally validation for Arthur fleck towards the end. I can't wait for how they will develop a sequel to this story."
"Aside from Joaquin Phoenix's performance being brilliant, I didn't enjoy the movie at all. The movie was slow & stayed on the same platitude."
"People are generally fascinated with what makes heroes and villains do what they do, whether it's real-life villains like Hitler or fictional characters like the Joker or Darth Vader. The first six episodes of Star Wars were all about the story of Darth Vader, how a little boy became the galaxy's ultimate villain, who terrorized and killed without mercy. So, thanks to ""Joker,"" we now understand how he became the evil character that he is. A key question, though is, when you step back from a movie, book, or any artistic creation, has it made the world better or worse? Really, that's a good question for any human endeavor. I think the first six episodes of Star Wars left the world better. Yes, we understood Vader; we understood how his circumstances and choices made him evil. Yet, when he became evil, he stayed evil; his violent acts were reviled. And, of course, ""SPOILER ALERT"", we were gratified by his redemption. 'Joker' doesn't do the same with the Joker. That's a problem, a big problem."
"The acting is good but they waste the movie time with repeating the same subject there is a missing part in movie to give attention to the storyline
Just watched him laughing only and the repeated it many times for nothing
Actually i did not complete the last 10 minutes as it was boring and each time tried to leave i was saying just give it another 10 minutes maybe something will happen but really nothing"
This movie is the one of the best movies I have ever seen
I don't know what else I can say. Movie left me speechless.
"I'm mesmerised , overwhelmed by the sheer beauty of Joaquin's Acting. The best cinematic experience I hve had in a long time. So glad I watched this in theatre."
"As I see the rating go from 9/10 to 8.9/10 I wonder who are the kind of people that would put this movie to such shame. Ultimately this movie needs a review of at THE LEAST 9/10 here. #YangGang #HumanityFirst, but 9/10 people.. Come on, amazing movie!!"
This movie mad me unbearably sad but I loved every moment of it a beautiful beautiful joker movie
"Perfect movie with a great storyline.
The actor was amazingly skilled and the camerawork was very well done in the scenes where it mattered the most. Best movie 2019."
"What to say about this film that does not reflect the title, is the best we have been able to enjoy lately, everything is wonderful, the exquisite photography, the right atmosphere, the amazing and unsurpassed script, all seasoned in addition with a sublime direction of Todd Phillips, which shows that we must follow him very closely in future projects.
And I leave a point exclusively for Joaquin Phoenix, the guaranteed winner of the next Oscar, in my opinion it is one of the best male performances in the history of the seventh art, I do not think there are concrete words to do justice to his interpretation, therefore I will not say anything else.
Everyone should watch this movie. 10/10"
"I loved the movie, great actor great acting
It was soooooo good
Sad and depressive
But cool"
"This movie defines the reality of pur society we r living in
Now a days people just enjoy movies like avengers based on action and fight but dont like movies which based on their lives and the society they r living in"
"I was have been anticipating this one for awhile and watched every trailer and clip and couldn't wait then read the critics reviews and was a little disappointed but still excited to see it and thank God i did! I don't know how critics have jobs cuz this movie was absolutely INCREDIBLE! OUTSTANDING performance by Phoenix, intense storyline, and the soundtrack was the cherry on top! Best movie i have seen in years!!!"
If Joaquin Phoenix doesn't get an Oscar for this it will only be because Hollywood is too sensitive. Probably best portrayal of the Joker yet...even though I still love Heath Ledger's version. This is just on another level! Would only warn against seeing this if you can't handle disturbing images/violence/dialogue. I have seen some of the worst cinema has to offer and I still got nervous sweats and felt incredibly uncomfortable the whole way through. Good luck!
"I went in for the second time for this movie because of how blown away I was the first time and how bone-chilling the experience was, the second time was no different it only made me appreciate the movie even more. An absolute must see, one of the greatest movies ever made in the 21st century with one of the greatest acting performances of all time by Joaquin Phoenix since heath ledger in the dark knight! Truly the best acting in the history of cinema! (10/10)"
"Joaquin Phoenix literally changed the game with acting as the joker. Left the cinema in amazement. I was virtually nearly off my seat for majority of the movie, and the movie definitely relates to what is going on in the world right now."
If this movie is not recognised by the Oscars then the hope in great performances will be lost.
"Went to watch the movie as a Heath ledger fan, came out as Joaquin Phoenix biggest fan. Best perfomance I've seen for any character. The movie is a bit slow at times but thats how character building is done. The movie absorbs you in itself with each upcoming scene.Highly Recommended."
"First let me start by saying that this is the least ""comic""-book movie made. There aren't any big and bombastic fight scenes, no set-up for sequals. This is a piece about a man who has been abused his entire life and finally decides to snap and do something about it. I know it is easy to get lost in todays world and the way that people treat this movie is unfair. It's not a political piece, it's not a movie about the ""good sides of violence"" (as some people have called it). It is a movie about a man struggling to find love, job and joy in his life. And Arthur's transformation in the famous Joker is beautifully done. When the movie starts you can see how uncomfortable and awkward Arthus is but by the end (the last 20 minutes when he is actually the Joker) you see everythyng has changed. His movement, the way he talks, his actions and you just see how in control he is.
They way the violence is done in this movie has something personal to it. There are comments about how violent and gory it is. Complete lies, movies like Logan and Deadpool are way move brutal than Joker.
And now of course the star of the movie JOAQUIN PHOENIX. Oh man was he amazing. From his first line to his last you can see feel everything he feels (anger/passion/fear). And the way he handles the role is perfecr, other actors would have chosen to go big and scream a lot and use ""scary"" voices. But not him, he is tame and you can tell he has done his homework.
Overall I did not have any major problems with The Joker. I think it is beautiful, frightening, intense and it fully immersed me in the rotting world of Gotham.
10/10
Words can't do it justice so just go and see it with your own eyes."
The only thing that bugged me is Joker's make up lol
"I just got out of watching JokerI have to say, it is really good... Possibly even great!! As a stand alone origin story, it's damn good. It moves at the pace of a 70's movie, so it may not be for everyone, but I found it mesmerizing to a level that it makes it an absolute winner. I think if they chopped about 15 minutes off the run time, it would have been better, whilst not missing a beat. There are elements of The King of Comedy and Taxi Driver as well as American Psycho.Now... Joaquin Phoenix might as well clear a space on his mantelpiece for an Oscar. I would be shocked if there is a better performance this year. The man is in every single scene. He carries this and at times, you forget that he is acting. His laugh is so real and twisted... The way he lost weight and transformed his body... The pain his character suffers and all the discoveries he makes that shape his life are just amazing and gracefully danced into a spectacular performance.There were a few predictable moments, but nothing to spoil the enjoyment!!Overall, this is a film to see, just to see one of the greatest actors of our time at the very top of his game.My screening was packed!! Only a spare seat here and there (annoyingly an ex and her new fella were in attendance🙈) second only to Avengers: End Game was was a complete sell out."
Boring film. Kept waiting for it to get going. Joaquin Phoenix (who is normally one of my favorite actors) was irritating and monotonous. I honestly could not wait for this film to end.
"It's been a long time since I've been as unsettled by a movie as I was by ""Joker."" The last one I can think of that comes close was ""First Reformed"" from last year, another film that taps into some very dark and disturbing feelings about the state of our modern world. But that movie at least offered the possibility of hope if you were willing to interpret it a certain way, whereas ""Joker"" is about as damn near nihilistic as you can get.I didn't really even want to see this movie, because I'm sick to death of the whole superhero craze and our country's obsession with it. The Joker is one of the most overexposed of all villains, and I didn't give a rat's ass about his origin story. But the thing is, this is barely a movie about the Batman Joker. It's pretty clear that director Todd Phillips and actor Joaquin Phoenix can barely muster up the energy to tie this story into any greater mythology, and the few meager attempts to do so are the only times during the movie when my brain hit snooze and my attention drifted. The rest of the film is a deeply disturbing character study of a lone man who's so tired of trying to play by the rules of a system that has no place for him that he decides to make his own. I won't call Phoenix a revelation, because we all knew he could act, but holy cow does he do something special in this movie. This is Daniel Day-Lewis in ""There Will Be Blood"" territory we're talking about here, where the word ""acting"" seems inadequate to describe what's happening on screen.There's a lot of controversy swirling around ""Joker."" Is it irresponsible to make a movie that basically gives lonely, angry white men a justification to carry out violent acts? Is the film just an empty, soulless, and cynical attempt to cash in on people's love of Batman and the series' villains? Is the film just ripping off of other, better movies, like ""Taxi Driver"" and ""King of Comedy?"" I think people will see what they want to see in ""Joker."" Some will see a hero figure in Arthur Fleck, and will either love or hate the movie because of it. Some will think the film is deep and profound while others will think it has nothing to say. I personally don't know that the film has anything to say, but the history of movies is full of great films that haven't necessarily ""said"" anything. ""Joker"" is a reaction to our very troubled times, and I was able to empathize with the character of Arthur Fleck to a certain point without condoning all of his actions. He's a mentally ill man who wants to get help but doesn't know how, or who's the victim of a system that doesn't care about mentally ill people. Meanwhile, the system is run by a bunch of fat cats who only care about making themselves and their cronies richer, while life for the average American gets harder and harder. Toss in our country's obsession with violence in general and guns in particular, and people like Arthur Fleck will be the inevitable result. I didn't interpret the movie as a rallying cry for incels, and I don't think it glamorized violence at all. Leave it to the ""Mission: Impossible"" movies (just as one example) to do that, yet no one ever holds movies like that to task. But I do think that more people than not may find someone to relate to in Arthur Fleck, and maybe that's what's so unsettling. Like him, and like Howard Beale, another famous movie character who's fed up with the system, I'm mad as hell, and I don't want to take it anymore. Of course I will, because I'm a rational adult who understands that progressive change moves forward in fits and starts. But wouldn't it feel just a little bit good to say screw it all and burn down the whole mess?It will be interesting to see how my reactions to ""Joker"" change over time and after we've passed this specific cultural moment. Who knows, maybe I'll think it's silly and juvenile twenty years from now when I think back on the Best Actor Oscar Joaquin Phoenix is almost certain to win. But right now, there's not a movie I've seen recently that feels more relevant or urgent than this one, and the balls this film has makes everything else currently playing look like a made-for-T.V. movie by comparison.Grade: A"
A more human and logical approach of the origins of joker! Definitely will touch your souls and remember every scene for a long time! A must see
"Literally one of the best movies I've ever seen. The acting the scenario the music, literally everything was unbelievably amazing"
"A masterpiece, one of the best movies of tge decade and century"
"I HATE THIS MOVIE!!!! It is complete crap. I really don't understand the hype over it. I was watching it and just couldn't watch it till the end.. it was so boring. I made myself go and watch it again till the end, but again there was no way for me to do that. It was extremely boring, made no sense, zero connection to Joker. When I saw people writing that Joaquin is better joker than Heath Ledger I just needed to see that. But now I'm asking myself are these people freaking normal, you just can't put these two names in the same sentence. Joaquin's joker can't and never will be better because it even isn't a joker, it is a disaster."
Phoenix tries to put a great effort. This movie is truly devoid of any plot or interaction. Not much happens and the pace is terrible. The overall theme of galvanizing those who society has overlooked was much better done in Fight Club.
"One of the best performances I've ever seen Joaqin phoenix truly deserves an oscar for this
.... besides the great acting and magnificent cast
Every thing else is very well done ( the directing the camera movement .... )
They've done there best to transfer the tragedy of the joker and make us sympathise him ."
"I can see many scenes of this movie becoming iconic.The scene on the stairs and the fabulous but creepy dance Joker makes as a way to release anxiety. I can see it become famous just like the Rocky Balboa jump or the ""I am the King of the World"" standing with the open arms from Titanic.I haven't seen a movie this good in ages; It is funny, it is creepy, its has suspense, it has violence, action. It is intense. It shows mental illness in a way very few movies have done it in the past.It has smart jokes and if you ever felt depressed or lonely in your life (which most people have), you will understand it much better.The movie has 2 hours but it feels like 20 minutes providing such intensity and hanging on the edge of the seat story lineJoaquin deserves an Oscar, so does the movie not only because its great but to encourage director and movies companies to invest in more movies like this.Don't listen to the ""critics"" about this movie, the people are loving it and the voice of the people is the voice of God. Critics they go in the opposite direction of the flow because they see themselves as being ""different"" and they want to be different by saying something else than what everybody says in a bid to make them look like they ""know"" more than everyone else. If everybody loves a movie, they will hate it. And if everybody hates a movie, they will love it. Its always the same thing.Everyone can be a critic nowadays, thanks to the internet. So don't listen to them anymore, its just an outdated way of reviewing movies and not one bit reliable anymore.Go watch Joker and jump to your own conclusions, I bet you won't regret watching it."
"I literally created an imdb account for the first time in order to attempt to warn people off of this terrible film. I have nothing good to say about it at all. It was a poorly crated story awkwardly told. The only saving grace is that Joaquin Phoenix acted an awful character in an awful story. I couldn't wait for the movie to end. I found it to be incredibly obvious and predictable for every ""twist"" in the film. The end credits were the best part when I finally was free. I was on a date or I would have just walked out early on."
"You've kept LEDGER alive ..!!
he must be looking down ,and smiling ..!!
this is the greatest tribute to master of acting Heath leadger..!!
TODD PHILIPS take a bow..!!"
"The moment the end credits where starting I had tears in my eyes and felt the urge to applaud, which is not happening in a cinema in Belgium ever! I hesitated but what a surprise: the whole audience started applauding and I could join anonymously...
I am a movie lover and 61. I must say that this is the most impressive movie I have ever seen. Pure melodrama. A true masterpiece."
I can't explain actually that how perfect this film is.
"You're not supposed to relate to the Joker!
You're meant to realise that some people are in pain. That people that act strangely should not be mocked, their life might have been horrific.
Be kinder, be more tolerant. Don't help create a real life Joker."
"In the first 5 minutes, Arthur cried twice. that gasping, uncontrollable laughter was actually crying. he cried and nobody realized. people, stupid people asked ""what's so funny?"" when he was actually crying and beat him when they didn't like how he made them feel.
I dont know about other countries but I have never seen a cinema, in this time of day, in Egypt this crowded except for avengers endgame. more shocking is people laughed! laughed with the joker. I don't know what it says about mental health here but I have concerns.
we live in planet so bent on denying bad thoughts. someone brilliantly called it ""toxic positivity"". saying ""cheer up"", ""just be happy"", ""smile!"" and ""think happy thoughts"" is just so cruel. Arthur telling the stone faced social worker ""you don't listen, do you? you never listen. you just ask the same questions every week. are you having any bad thoughts? ALL I have is bad thoughts"".
the real wakeup call here is we know from the comics that Thomas Wayne was good guy, he was sincere in his wish to save Gotham and I'm assuming Murray was a good guy too bc I waited for big villain reveal but he seemed genuinely nice. if that's how nice people treat mental illness, HOW WE TREAT IT??? the answer is resonating yes.
Alfred explained to Bruce in batman the dark knight how some men just want to watch the world burn. well, monsters aren't born, they are created.
in the end, he danced in hallway after killing the therapist, he wasn't escaping, he didnt have plans. the joker is very simple man indeed. he wishes to watch the world burn and he is the villain we deserve."
Rate this a 10 because people have been giving it 8's and 9's without stating what was wrong with it because there isn't anything wrong with it and it deserves to be above 9 stars.
"Do not let the matacritic score fool you ! It is comprised of people who are quick to label the film edgy jusy because it touches on social matters, people who in my opinion should not be able to publish a movie rating as professionals. Everything that has to do with The Joker is done in a perfect way. Not only is phoenix's performance astonishing but the cinematography and climate of the film are perfect. It is truly a drama that makes an excellent background story for the character and has you on your heels everytime Joaquin is on the screen. Plus the violence felt very impactful and carried a message instead of simply being a way to make the film more intense."
"This is not a really good Movie.This Movie is whatever people can say, when they so not find words after seeing it.2hrs with a Villain ......I wont Spoil this great experience. I would be the Villain If I would do.Thank you Todd Phillips."
I almost didn't go to see this as I've always had a problem viewing movies that have so hyped. But to be honest this is one movie worth seeing. I have been a total fan of Heath Ledgers Joker since it came out but to be fair this is worthy of being right up there with it. Phoenix's Joker is mesmerising and I found it hard to look away no matter how difficult the situation. I felt a lot of things during this performance and didn't need the whole box and dice of CGI trickery to get me there! Just stunning performances by all concerned. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone
Joaquin Phoenix's performance in joker is amazing everything about this movie is amazing. Amazing script great acting 10/10 you need to see this movie
"From the director of ""The Hangover"" trilogy comes a dark and gritty version of Joker's origin story. His version of the Joker seems to be heavily inspired by Martin Scorsese's ""The King of Comedy"" with a touch of ""Taxi Driver"". On top of that, there are some attempts of commentary about society and how crooked it is. When you mix all those things up, you get a film that's going to divide everyone's opinions.Let's begin with the good stuff first. Easily, the best part of the film was a performance by Joaquin Phoenix. He carried this film completely and he gave one of the better performances of his career (nothing is going to beat his performance in ""The Master""). He proved once again why he's one of the best actors working today. If someone else was in his place, there's no way this film would've worked. His mannerisms, facial expressions (especially how he showed so many different emotions through laughs and eye expressions at the same time), his physicality and his vulnerability were incredible. If this film received a bit better reviews he would definitely be the main contender for that Oscar. Furthermore, the next aspect with which I was blown away was the score. I would even say that the score was a more effective way of showing emotions than the script. Because of the score at every moment, you knew how you were supposed to feel regarding what's happening on the screen, and that was achieved in a way that wasn't forceful. If you listen carefully to the score, you can even distinguish what scenes happened in reality and which were just in his imagination. Those two aspects of the film were outstanding and they carried the film noticeably. The color palette really nicely supported the script. Through the colors in the film, you could've seen in what mood the main character was and how he felt about what was happening around him. Colors helped to immerse the audience into that time period (I would say the film happened in 1981 because the movie theatre was showing the film ""Blow Out"" which came out in that year), but that wouldn't work without production design which was on the point.
The cinematography was decent. Although the director's vision wasn't groundbreaking I generally enjoyed most of the camera choices.Let's get into some aspects that weren't so good. The script. It's one of the weakest parts of the film. You get a feeling the film wanted to say a lot, but unfortunately, it ended up saying almost nothing. There were a lot of attempts to give some social commentary, but for me personally, that fell flat because there wasn't any explanation of why is everything how it is. Joker as a character for the huge part of the film was complaining about how society is bad and how everyone is mean, but there wasn't any reason given why is the world like that, beyond poverty and poor people suck and rich people are corrupted and evil. Regarding that specific aspect, I felt like the director wanted to say a lot, but it just ended up being shallow and on the nose. The film was beating you over the head of how everything is bad. I would've appreciated concluding by myself that the world is crooked, but instead, I was just told what the situation was, without any room for my own interpretations. And that explained situation wasn't backed up with any other pieces of information. This time, tell don't show approach didn't work out. Furthermore, speaking of the script, all characters except Joker were unbelievable and underwritten. Zazie Beetz was completely unutilized and the relationship between her character and the Joker was underdeveloped. The film was supposed to make you believe in their relationship, but it didn't and because of it the film suffered at the later stages of its runtime. I understood what did film tried to achieve with their relationship, but that wasn't realized very well. That sentence could've been used for many aspects of this film. Robert De Niro as an older version of Rupert Pupkin had a ton of fun in this film, one of the better De Niro's performances since ""Casino"". They could've done more with his character, but at least it seemed like he had fun with this project. So, Joker is basically the only character that was decently written, but the thing is, the director didn't make a clear choice if we were supposed to feel for him or we were supposed to hate him because of his actions. Don't get me wrong, he isn't a good person, but the film way too many times tried to make the audience sympathize with him. I don't know if that was intentional or not, but at the times it felt way too forceful.In the end, looking at the whole picture, this is a good film but isn't anything spectacular. At the same time, I would say the film was overblown with praises of how good it was, and yet at the same time, it was unfairly criticized because of some aspects in the film (e.g. the usage of violence)."
"I must say I'm disappointed. I love the Batman universe and especially the story behind Joker. Considering it's been a lot of talk around this movie, I expected more. The first half of the movie was pretty long drawn, towards the end it was great but not so much before that in my opinion. They could have done so much more with the time they had.
Also, something that I struggle with is that every move Joker made was very predictable basic psychology (my opinion). Joker isn't supposed to be predictable, that is a part that makes him so interesting. Besides from all that the actor did an amazing job potraying Joker!"
"Heath ledger would be so proud!
It was amazing! Blew my mind ! I will watch it again and again !
After a long time finally a good movie ! Enjoyed every second with every cell of my body !"
"A long time i did not enjoy and get marveled by a film.
If the decition depend on me, I said, Oscar to Best Film, And Oscar to Best Leading Role to Joaquin Phoenix, there is no equal, One of the most difficult role to perform in movies history and its overwhelm by Joaquin. You must see this film an prepear to see masterful performance in every detail."
"Every year I deal with one issue - less new movies that deserve to be called art. But Joker is a rare example of what you can call art in every way. The creators of this movie made 2019 successful by making Joker, making the viewer feel wide range of emotions that push us beyond borders of standard perception. Thank you for this piece of art, a gift for all of us who create new perceptions and new visions."
"It's been reported that some people found the level of violence so graphic they have walked out of the showing..I can understand why. It's inexcusable that they did as they missed the ultimate tale in morality and their lives will be poorer for that fact.If you expect to see a bells and whistle CGI extravagance, you'll be disappointed. If, like me, you want a psychonautical joyride into the creation of the character of Joker.. open yourself to the lesson you're about to receive.Joaquin's portrayal is by far the superior version and most credible I have watched to date and his is a performance, I feel, cannot be surpassed, and should not, as here is the ultimate lesson of the nature of humanity - a poignant tale of human kindness and the consequences when that chain fails.. there are always repercussions for that imbalance and in the Joker, we see the deepest, darkest, most tragic and twisted sequence of consequences that should be a wake up call for us all, particularly now with the social injustices that are now common place. A Joker is reflected in each dispossessed person and we are many.A genuine masterclass in acting by Phoenix. The collaboration between Todd Phillips and Scott Silver is sheer brilliance."
"I miss Heath Ledger and can't get enough of his portrayal of Joker. He was intimidating, scary, unpredictable and all other things. In 2016, we got Suicide Squad and Jared Leto as Joker both of which disappointed me very much. After that, I thought that I don't want to see another Joker interpretation on the big screen. I was skeptical when I heard that a standalone Joker movie was in works. Then I heard about the casting of Joaquin Phoenix as Joker and I developed an interest in it because I love his work. He is a method actor and has given some of my favorite performances for example in Her (2013) and The Master (2012). I decided to see the movie in the theater after hearing a lot about the movie, good and bad and I am glad that I saw it.This movie is really good, it exceeded my expectations and Joaquin Phoenix should get an Oscar for his work. He is phenomenal and I was blown away by his performance. His performance alone carries the whole movie and lets you experience and understand the character without saying much. His physique, movements, gestures, grace, way of speaking suggests that he gave his everything to make the character compelling and stand out from other Joker portrayals. He lost 52 pounds for the role. He embodied the character of Joker. Comparing his performance with Heath Ledger will be absurd. There is no common ground for comparison. Both interpretations of Joker are significantly different, the story is different, character motivations are different.Now talking about the story, this is a standalone Joker movie that shows how a man beaten up, neglected and humiliated by the society turns into a maniac. This movie follows Arthur Fleck who works as a party clown and lives with his mother. He wants to be a stand-up comic. He suffers from a condition causing him to laugh uncontrollably. We feel his loneliness, depression, and condition and sympathize with him for it. All the other performances were also very good. This movie isn't that much violent as people are saying it to be, but it makes you feel the violence and it is unsettling. It also allows the viewer to form their perspective about the character. Sometimes you will agree with his actions and sometimes you won't. There are also certain funny scenes in the movie but not everyone may find it funny.The movie is directed by Todd Phillips and he has done an outstanding job. I didn't think that the guy who made The Hangover movies can pull this off, but he did it. He showed that as a filmmaker, he can make more than just R rated comedies. The film is set in 1981 and the period is very well reflected in the movie. The cinematography is top-notch. Shot composition, camera placement, camera movement has been handled well. I was surprised by how good the Gotham city looked, beautiful and dirty at the same time. Each scene had a color scheme. The lights in the surroundings like light from streetlights, cars or the sky illuminated everything with their light. Joker/Arthur Fleck's emotions get conveyed through shades of light falling on him which is beautiful to look at. Music is beautiful, chilling, hypnotizing and speak lengths about the inner feelings of the character.I have just a few issues with the plot of the movie and how some things happen which shouldn't have happened or couldn't have happened, rest the movie is flawless."
"I really liked the way heath ledger portrayed joker in dark knight. Funny, cunning, evil. If he was living today, he would have aced this movie. But surprisingly, Joaquin does it even better. He is rarely funny but very alone and pathetic. His condition becomes worse and worse until he breaks out, wreaking havoc to Gotham. The story flows smoothly through Arthur's life, how the situation around influences him to become the joker. The supporting characters including Robert de Niro have done an excellent job but nobody can beat Joaquin. He was at a completely different level!! A pure masterclass of cinema. If you are a fan of joker, don't miss this one! Another Oscar worthy performance from Joaquin. If he gets it, it ll be second time for the same role."
You never seen anything like this Joaquin shines so bright that you would be amazed of how great he is in this movie everything about this movie is perfect i promise.
Unbelievable!!! Movie of the year absolutely. 👏🏻
"'Joker (2019)' is one of the most intense and disturbing films I've seen in a long time. It really is surprisingly fantastic, an unsettling and complex character-study that's as uncompromising as it is gripping. Inspiration was clearly taken from 'The King Of Comedy (1982)' and, to a lesser degree, 'Taxi Driver (1976)', but this isn't just a cut-and-paste copy. It's very much its own beast, as much a horror movie as it is a comic-book one. Don't let Phillips fool you, by the way, this certainly is a comic-book movie. It's a phenomenal comic-book movie that blows almost all others out of the water, but a comic-book movie nonetheless. It takes inspiration from several well-known storylines and has a firm grasp on both its titular character and all the other classic Gotham elements, much more so than one might expect given the marketing. None of this is meant as a slight, just an exploration of the fact that comic-book movies are ""real"" movies. Here, we have a probable career-best performance from Phoenix, who's often frightening even when sitting still, and a definite career-best directorial effort from Phillips, who seems to have elevated himself far beyond the generally well-regarded 'The Hangover (2009)'. The whole thing is just so well-made, clearly crafted with absolute clarity of vision from the very beginning. The screenplay is great, the cinematography is gorgeous and the musical score is outright masterful. The flick works so well because it doesn't pretend there are 'heroes and villains'. You don't really identify with the protagonist, you pity him. You want him to be okay, to find a way out of his inevitably dark situation, but certainly aren't cheering along with him when things eventually get even worse. There's no 'good guy', just a guy. He undergoes some serious trauma and, often, the piece elicits a strong emotional response when this happens. Yet, when he decides to deal with it in a criminal way, you're never 'on his side'. Instead, you just watch in shock and horror, glued to the edge of your seat. Indeed, the violence here is some of the most impactful I've seen, each moment punching you straight in the gut. It's not fun, it's horrible and that's how it should be. There's no doubt that this is an amazing feature. It's absolutely gripping and I can't stress that enough. It gets under your skin and wriggles around, as interesting to reflect on as it is to watch. It's not exactly 'nice' but it's not supposed to be. It's brave, realistic stuff that's easily up there, right at the top, as one of the best of the year. As a footnote, I just can't believe how well they incorporated the Joker's classic laugh into a piece as grounded as this; it's chilling, tragic and integral to the character, yet still as over-the-top as you'd think (though, you might not realise it when it happens). Honestly, I still can't quite comprehend how good this whole affair is. It's simply divine. 9/10"
"We watched Joker tonight, and I expected good acting from Joaquin Phoenix, wasn't sure about the story and everything else but I was willing to see how it will go. What I didn't expect was that I wouldn't blink an eye throughout the movie. It was absolutely brilliant. Joaquin Phoenix didn't just give us good performance, but made Joker so real. Like he is one of us, and as my friend said - scary part was that you could relate to him and be on the same track with his thoughts. Everything is perfect in this movie - story, acting, photography, music... hell even the colors of this world are perfect. Joaquin Phoenix carried the whole storry on his back - it was an one man show that took all your attention, imagination, stirred all your feelings and emotions and left you speechless when The End letters came on the screen. The best movie this year for sure - Phoenix deserves Oscar for this one and any other reward he can get in this world. BRILLIANT!!!!"
Spectacular ...phenomenal..brearhtaking !! Joaquin Phoenix is truely a LEGEND!!!!
"Travis Bickle is also an anti-hero like Arthur Fleck, so many bad things at once, a product of the times, but his actions are never justified or rendered aspirational either through plot or aesthetics of the film. The same goes for Rupert Pupkin in Scorsese's another masterpiece 'The King of Comedy' from which Todd Philips, the director, heavily borrows but without any proper insight or thought. Class divide, neurological issues, childhood trauma and all that glitter is thrown in the movie to disguise the shallow depth of ideas and adds to the confusion. The film tries to be so many things and ends up being none. 'Poser' would be a better title.Joaquin Phoenix's acting is everything though. Very familiar but still feels fresh and knocks your socks off (and oh that laugh is haunting) and he was the singular reason I didn't walk out of the film after the first 15 minutes because the moment Arthur Fleck commits the third murder (and which obviously was not a self-defense tactic), I thought, ""lo beta, ghus gaye na ghhade me! Yahan se impossible hai nikalna."" And making my worst fears come true, this humorless film just kept on digging that first act grave.So, in short: Loved Joker. Just hated the film he was in.PS: Watch HBO's 'Succession' if you want to take notes on how to have a people as your protagonists, humanize them and still maintain that much-necessary ironic distance from them."
"I'm shocked bad movie overrated realiy you guys follow media this isn't good things juat go and watch the real joker (the dark knight ) then came and rate this , and i have no more words but i must file it i have no more words but i must file it"
"Not as good as i thought, too much overrated by people"
Just came back from the theater. Joaquin is an absolute genius. This movie is not about violence at all..those who think that they just miss the whole point. Be kind to each other. That's all I'm going to say.
"What a movie!! From start to finish it is an absolute masterpiece, the way Phoenix portrays the Joker is a Oscar worthy performance. The movies overall message about mental health and how people get affected is amazing, it shows that doesn't matter what goes on people always have problems and always need help!! Will hands down be one of, if not the best movie of 2019!"
"DO NOT go and waste your money there... the film is boring boring boring at the end of the movie I was still waiting for the crimes, thriller scene and drama is bad bad bad...."
"Joker is the best movie to release this year. I doubt any movie releasing this year will come close to it. Joker tackles mental illnesses perfectly. Despite the brutalities he's caused throughout the movie, you can't just help yourself but to feel sorry for him. I'd be a liar if I said I didn't cry at least twice during the movie. Fleck really shows how one bad day can drive you over the edge. It perfectly depicts how mental illnesses can drive you to do inhumane stuff. The violence in Joker felt way too real, all the deaths in the film, the 3 Wall Street guys, Arthur's mom, Randall, Murray Franklin. I felt like I was there for the deaths. The death that hit me the most was Murray, it was so sudden and out of the blue. Arthur really looked up to Murray as a father figure, an icon. When Arthur admitted to killing the Wall Street guys, that's when he really turned into Joker. Arthur Fleck was long gone.Joker really isn't a movie. It's a wake up call. It's a fictionalized documentary. It goes to show how one bad day can destroy your entire life. If you're suffering from mental illnesses, please don't hesitate to ask for help."
"What a fantastic evening out - with son and daughter (both older than the lead!) and loads of popcorn to see Joaquin Phoenix give the performance of his life in Joker.
No spoilers and a huge amount to contemplate and revisit in further viewings. Suffice to say this is a slow burn movie with brilliant director, leading cast and cinematography and run down Gotham City staging that makes this a mesmerising movie experience. Everyone will be talking about their favourite moments - mine includes a certain door key!
Joaquin as the evil Emperor Commodus gave us the famous 'thumbs down' to Russell Crowe as Maximus in Gladiator but it is a resounding 'thumbs up' for his remarkable portrayal of mentally ill Arthur Fleck in his descent to madness to become the criminal mastermind known as the Joker.
."
"I'm going to keep this short and sweet because there isn't much that hasn't already been said and explored but if you're reading this wanting a little input or motivation to see this movie, then all I can say is ""If you don't get it, you won't like it, if you do get it, you won't stop thinking about it.""Best movie in a long time."
"One of the most amazing films that I have ever seen in my lifetime. Phoenix, De Niro, and the entire cast are fantastic. Phoenix's acting is ""off the hook"" amazing. Rarely have I ever left the movie theater mesmerized by what I just saw. I am just simply glad that I saw a masterpiece like that in my lifetime...and it proved to me that the film industry, one that has been sadly fixated on CGI and special effects, is still capable of making a film that can penetrate the soul of the audience with a great script and amazing acting."
I went in with high expectations and came out absolutely blown away. A timeless piece of cinema with one of the greatest acting performances of all time.
"A engaging story, some splendid cinematography, stellar acting. Joaquin Phoenix gave the best performance as a villain since Heath Ledger as Joker. A true Masterpiece"
"To appreciate ""Joker"" I believe you have to have either gone through something traumatic in your lifetime (and I believe most of us have) or understand somewhere in your psyche what true compassion is (which usually comes from having gone through something traumatic, unfortunately). An example of dangerous compassion would be to, say, make a film made about the fragility of the human psyche, and make it so raw, so brutal, so balletic that by the time you leave the theatre you not only don't want to hurt anything but you desperately want an answer and a solution to the violence and mental health issues that have spun out of control around us.
-Josh Brolin"
"Few modern, mainstream films today can be considered art, but this breaks the mould.I spent the first two thirds of this film in tears, it provoked a very painful reaction from me. Society, in particular, the worst parts of our society, were represented in an extreme way, nonetheless it did depict how we treat each other and especially how we treat people that are different to us.By the time Joker was unleashed, I was actually glad that he felt freed, confident and enacting his revenge on some of the worst people imaginable. By the end of the movie, I was rooting for him. Very odd given the things he was doing.The way in which this film was shot is mesmerising, the cinematography, score and Joaquin's acting are flawless. The film retains the comic book feel but is very real.I've said several times that no interpretation of Joker could eclipse Heath Ledger's, but Joaquin is just next level, some of the best acting I have ever seen.Joker is a masterpiece."
"If this film doesn't win several Oscar's, I will eat my hat! Mr Phoenix is sublime. This is an incredible portrayal of a character descending into madness and the most intense I have ever seen. As an actor, JP executes with genius. A great film and the best I've seen all year. Right up there with the greats!!!"
"This movie will make you sad, make you angry and maybe it'll make you a little bit crazy too."
I was numb on the first half of the movie. Shouldn't have watched it because now I can't get over it. I will lose faith in humanity if Joaquin Phoenix is not winning Oscar for this.
What i saw was the best movie I've ever seen since long time
"I am just amazed at how this only 69% of critics liked it, but it has a 9.0 here! I admit that it's not as good as Heath Ledger's Joker, but it's still awesome. The funny thing is that there's a good reason why the movie isn't called ""THE Joker"". The creators said that the Joker might just be a persona various people took. Batman does in fact appear in this, but only as a small child. He's worked very well into the plot.I could really associate with what Joker was going through. He had been taking all these medicines yet none of them worked. He was angry at the rich for oppressing the poor. Him killing rich people at first really does inspire people. It really was a great study on the status of the richest and treats the story as very mundane. That was kind of already done in ""The Dark Knight"", but the focus is done so well here too. ***1/2"
"I haven't seen such a masterpiece for a long time. It's unbelievable. I don't know if it was right to still call this acting, as it seems to have been brought from another dimension. Your are part of this movie. You are part of the thoughts of The Joker. You even become like him.. My laughter has changed forever now!
A must-watch!"
"Amazing acting, superb directing. Keeps you fascinated include to to the screen. Dark, Twisted, and Fun."
"This is what we were waiting for, the best joker ever, the acting of phoenix was unbelievable, the directing was perfect this what we need from long time."
"I don't usually review movies but this one was something different something fresh and even after watching 5 days back, the movie isn't getting out of my head.Great acting by Joaquin, story telling style was so unique, the background score and a cinematography. Totally Flawless & Loved it."
"This movie lived up to the hype. I can say that they shot this movie beautifully and Joaquin Phoenix had an outstanding performance, and eveyone should see it its a MUST! This movie captures alot especially In this day n age where these problems like mental health actually happen alot.."
So worth it! Amazing comic book movie that stands out from the crowd
"Forever alone in a crowd, failed comedian Arthur Fleck seeks connection as he walks the streets of Gotham City. Arthur wears two masks -- the one he paints for his day job as a clown, and the guise he projects in a futile attempt to feel like he's part of the world around him. Isolated, bullied and disregarded by society, Fleck begins a slow descent into madness as he transforms into the criminal mastermind known as the Joker"
"Never before have I felt the need to write a review, but this film was amazing, weird, sad, brilliant, and it may make you question a few things in life, plus you may need to watch it more then once to truly understand what the hell you have just watched. GO SEE THIS MOVIE."
What can I say? I'm a massive Batman fan and a little obsessed with the franchise. I wanted to watch this movie to get a background on the Joker to complete my Batman experience. I've watched every Batman ever made including the Adam West TV show as a kid.I came out of this movie in absolute awe and to be honest a little emotional. It was a beautiful portrayal of a beautifully mad man. I feel emotional after watching it. It spoke to me on so many levels. What would happen if we just let go and have in to the voices in our heads and ignored societies restraints? This was what happens.Hands down the best movie I've ever seen in my life. Without a doubt. Heath Ledger looks like Bonzo the clown compared to this. As for Old mate from suicide squad he needs to never do another one.
"This movie deserves all the possible oscars, specially best actor."
"This was one of my best moviegoer experiences!
Joaquin Phoenix is simply brilliant in this role and the movie is much deeper, darker and grounded in reality than any feature film in the Batman universe.
I was honestly so impressed that I had to fight the urge to start applauding when it was over! I haven't felt that way about a film in years!"
"I've never written a review or rated a movie before. BUT this! I had to. This needs to get as much positive recognition. I ABSOLUTELY LOVED THIS MOVIE. With all it's darkness, Reality of society. This is REAL. A movie to make people uncomfortable to make people see and understand. A movie where they can't turn away. I hope this brings awareness. How to be kind to one another. But over all this movie was genius. Epic. BEAUTIFUL."
"JokerFilm is not your normal comic hero/villian movie, it's more a commentary on society's treatment of vulnerable people and it's volitile consequences. Brittiant film and well worth seeing👍🃏Note: All it takes is an act of kindness to prevent a monster. Let it be a clown or a bat!

"I guess the people not happy with this film expected a typical ""Joker"" movie. It's not. It's a film about the man who 'becomes' the Joker. A character study. This is not a feel good movie and don't expect to leave the cinema feeling happy. It's depressing, it's bleak and it's quite uncomfortable to watch at points. It has a constant fog of dread hanging over it that's heavy.
You feel sorry for this person, probably even root for him and that's a real weird thing as we know what he eventually becomes, but I suspect that was the point.
The music score is outstanding, adding massively to the film in no other way I can think of than how the track from Jaws impacted that film so much.
The filmography is also top not notch.
Phoenix is absolutely electric, you cannot take your eyes off him. If he doesn't win an Oscar for this performance, he might as well pack up and forget about it. He could do no more.
Best film I've seen in a long time, which is a weird thing as, again, you don't leave with a feel good vibe, but it's all the better for it.
Outstanding."
"This is not a movie to be enjoyed or entertained but taken as strong message to bring the humanity. I was expecting it to be great movie but it turned out to be 'one of the greatest' movie. This movie deserves multiple watch. This movie is all about how a man who is disregarded by the society, bitter treatment from society, abandoned by society, and failure as a comedian made him a serial killer. Never ever we should step into crime world because of the dark society. We always should seek some help from a trustworthy guy instead of stepping into crime world. But a major point which can't be neglected is 'dark society'. In a place where this Joker tries to spread joy and happiness has got him only kicks and punches not just on his body but on his inner self, too. This wounded him deeply. This filled his life with loads of pain, depression, mental disorder and what not resulting in a 'serial killer' and 'chaos' all around. Society can't be blamed always. Both society and the victim should be blamed. Both society and victim should vomit all the darkness.Ending with my single line thought:
What society need is good heart to understand and love each other. What victim need is love and warmth hug from the society.joaquin phoenix, lead actor of this movie, wore the role as his own skin."
"The character of Joker received much more love even though being an antagonist in The Dark Knight Trilogy. Todd Philips did a phenomenal job of creating an origin story for Joker and had the guts to present a standalone movie to the public. This movie leaves you in a shock for a moment and makes you think a lot. Some shocking moments that totally grips you, I find no reason as to keep this movie reserved for only 18+
Camera movement and the shots taken are so cool that they deliver a story without a single dialogue being said. This movie keeps you glued to the screen till the end credits roll in.It is a must watch for all Joker Fans and I believe the count of these fans will increase all the more!"
"Phoenix showed me what it is to be a joker. i watched the whole movie with heath in mind.one scene actually showed me heath . the transformation is brilliant. mother sentiment is beautiful.
Gripped me from the beginning.Arthur fleck /Joker is definitely will be in mind for a long time.
much awesome direction from todd phillips. Stunner"
"If Todd Phillips wanted to spend $55 million on creating yet another pointlessly glorified, anti-hero and attempt to pass it off as a case study of a mentally ill agent being displaced by society, he could've at least spent a portion of that budget employing people who are able to contribute honest, fair, and much-needed portrayals of actual disaffected minorities in society."
"I dislike this movie, although I do not deny the great performance of Joaquin Phoenix. I extremely dislike the ways to send the genuine message about mental illness: unrealistically ugly graffiti everywhere on/in the bus and buildings, unreasonable intensified music here and there, over-centered crime scenes, unrealistic incapable/stupid police, weird development of psychiatric disorders, unbelievable reaction of the society to the crime behaviors... all of them make me extremely uncomfortable rather than enjoying the show."
"The joker went with Heith ledger
I didnt found anything special except the music and the direction...the cast of joakin is brilliant but the story is poor and details are missedNothing that brilliant except the 6 months of commercial advertising"
"Joker is the main adversary of Batman. Going back to the 60s where tv where he was crazy and wicked, each version on the big screen has gone up a notch. Jack showed brillance and wicked as did Heath. Their ability to compete with a brilliant Batman was not just based on being the evil Batman, but his equal in brain power.Not so with this pychopath, who was been damaged so bad he shows no intelligence. Just pure evil. And that is not what the Joker is. This Joker is an embarressment and when you walk out of the movie you will know this is not the Joker, this is Michael Myers in clown face.Some of the plot is well thought out, making the rich the true evil and blaiming everything on Thomas Wayne, and Mom Fleck, and bullies and everyone else. And Joker ""coming out"" by killing 3 sleezeball ""stock trader"" types that brought all of this on themselves. The first 2 deserved it and it would have been self defence, but then he hunted down and shot the third in the back as he was trying to get away. From there it was just a horror movie with clownface. Then the upset mobs, tired of their lot in life make him their hero. Kinda like OJ and Trump.No it's not political Joker says, but yes it is. It is preachy and a terrible movie."
"This movie is a masterpiece! The acting and character development is one of a kind. Not your typical kid friendly action hero movie (I was hoping it wouldn't be). Instead, it tells the story of a deeply disturbed man and his rise to power. A psychological work of art.A must see!"
"Masterpiece movie of the decade to influence generations.
Joker is a Traumatizing psychological drama/thriller that puts the spotlight on a comic book villian called joker.
Though the movie is inspired by the comic world which is imaginary, the movie feels real and authentic.
Unlike other comic book movies which are filled with CGI and animation, joker uses story over action.
The movie is about arthur fleck (joaquin phoenix), a middle aged, miserable, poor standup comedian who suffers from mental problems and lives with his old mother.
He lives in gotham city where the people are cruel, emotionless and awful. Arthur is lonely and helpless yet he tries to be a good human being by sending positive energy and trying to make the people laugh and smile but the others are so wicked, merciless, enraged and furious they don't even accept him and make him feel worse by bullying, beating and abandoning him. Imagine what happens when a victim of society runs out of patience and turns extremely evil.
The atposphere of the film is quite dark and the pace of the movie is a little slow in the beginning but as we go forward in the story it goes faster and faster just like a roller coaster.
The music and soundtracks used in the movie are perfectly in place and completely related to the theme of movie.
The climacteric of the movie is joaquin phoenix's fabulous and oscar worthy acting , where he delivers the sense of the film in the best way possible.
Joker might be one of the darkest movies made in decades but definitely deserves to be watched with patience and attention because it's one of the few movies that besides giving audience entertainment it tries to make people think."
This movie is absolutely amazing. Joaquin Phoenix did one of the greatest performances in the cinema's history.
Well scripted casted directed and performed.. credit to the director todd philips guys a genius.. and 2 cast joaquin pheonix the most underrated actor in hollywood.. A masterstroke.. this is a movie that cinema fans movie fanatics have been yearning for something different and unique look at life from a different perspective.. Best film best actor.. An outstanding contribution to cinema Thank you 😊
"This is the kind of movie you only see once per decade or so and realize that you are watching a future classic/masterpiece of art.
J.Phoenix is hypnotizing to watch and deserves two Oscar statuettes if that was possible for his performance as Arthur/Joker.
Also Todd Phillips deserves an Oscar for both the directing and the writing of this movie.
A true masterpiece and a must watch. Speechless for any other word to describe this movie. 10/10!"
"I was blown away by the phenomenal performance of Joacquin Phoenix, absolutely top acting !!"
"A modern Neo-noir crime drama which begs the philosophical question of acceptance in the society and dares to ask hard question on the role society plays in the making of a criminal. Beautifully acted, perfectly directed, magnificently shot, the movie transcends the genre film making with a hint scorseseism violence and story telling. The performance of joaquin phoenix is beyond imagination, the actor outdid himself."
"I can't believe that this just an act or just a movie
Joaquin Phoenix deserves the oscar"
"This is the masterpiece that no one can make without so many things coming together, to create a tale that have been attempted countless times, but the best version is manifested now.Joker can be seen as an origin story, or an independent story in Batman universe, or an independent movie in our world, and it will do justice to every point of view.If Ledger made Joker the biggest villain amongst all, Phoneix has made him something beyond the very identity that Joker has, he is not a villain in the strictest sense of the word, instead he is the victim, very much like his arch-nemesis and the biggest superhero of all time.I'd go on writing and my current emotions wouldn't be able to dig it all, so I'd just say thanks DC to attempt this, and wish them best to make the first billion dollar plus R-rated film."
Perfect and joker 2019 is very good thank you very much
The acting was amazing!! He could not have done ANY better with the script he had. Acting 10/Script 8.5 Phoenix has become an acting legend with this movie.
"One of the greatest movies ever made in my opinion, but not a movie everyone would understand. The layers may be too deep and inaccessible for some people. From my point of view: Great acting, fantastic production, a nerve-wracking story, morbid humor and the score is out of this world."
The plot could've been a little more defined BUT Joaquin is phenomenal. Flawlessly done. He deserves every award possible for his performance.
"10/10. Not gonna say much! FBI, CIA, NSA all are on the lookout for Joker reviews in social media. Literally!!Joaquin Phoenix is winning the Oscar. Said and sealed."
"Here's a rhetoric question - does Joaquin deserves an Oscar for this role!?To be honest, I actually don't care who else is running for the best actor in leading role, i was ready to give him Oscar after watching this movie for just 30min."
"This movie gave an insight to the picture of mental illness and how consuming it is. If people want to say this movie is ""dark"" it's the picture of that real disease. For me this movie was a true pleasure, Joaquin absolutely poured all of his talent into his role. His portrayal brought to light the real reason The Joker became such the character. His performance alone made this a must see if you are a fan of Batman."
"I will start off by saying this review will be spoiler free, as well as a minor disclaimer for those thinking about seeing Todd Phillip's Joker.If you are expecting your typical, over-done, run of the mill comic book movie. You won't find that here. This is not a film filled with jokes that either work or don't work; this isn't a movie where the heroes always win. This is a movie centered around a troubled man and his descent into madness.It is dark and, at times, horrifying. And it is an outstanding masterpiece because of that. Had this movie been toned down, it would not have been nearly as great as it is.Joker is centered around a failed, mentally-troubled comedian called Arthur Fleck. He is constantly looked down upon by society, beaten and bullied. And, as you may have guessed, this causes him to slowly lose his mind and become the Joker. That's not a spoiler, by the way. If you think that's a spoiler, look at the name and synopsis of the movie.It's filled with shocking, gruesome scenes. Tense encounters. A realistic depiction of how it is to lose sanity. And it is absolutely terrifying. A once innocent man trying to chase his dream like so many of us is beaten and bullied, or often ignored by society when it matters, becomes ones of the most notorious criminals in all of comic book history.Joaquin Phoenix delivers an Oscar-Worthy performance that rivals that of Heath Ledger. And at times? It trumps Heath Ledger's Joker. It is crazy and sadistic and, at times, honestly haunting. Terrifying, even. The writing is absolutely incredible in this movie and complements Joaquin's acting abilities. I don't think there could have been anyone better to star in this movie than him.Acting his fantastic across the board. But this review would be incredibly long if I wrote as much about them as I have Phoenix. But everyone, from top to bottom, contributed to this masterpiece extremely well.If you've not seen it already, go see it! Just do not expect this to be like anything else you have seen. It's dark, twisted and haunting. It's not a happy-go-lucky, joke filled superhero flick.10/10"
"This dark film was something that I knew I'd see but maybe I'd wait til streaming release but without something to do on Halloween I took myself to movies.I did not read any reviews but as I sat in cinema watching every last credit scroll up the only word that seemed fitting was Masterpiece. It seems that's a word common to describe this.The frail and yet emotionally powerful physicality of Phoenix captivates and unsettles throughout.The clever weaving of different characters' storylines in this origin tale makes complete sense and nothing feels contrived. Whether or not (perhaps especially if you are not) a fan of superhero blockbusters this film should draw you in and haunt you.Much food for thought on how society deals with difference,...not paying lip service to it..the innocence of Frankenstein, grotesque and wanting love and acceptance in a cruel world definitely echoes in this universal story.I recommend to anyone who likes to be moved not just entertained.."
One the best movie of all-time . Master performance by Jouaquin Phoenix . Powerfully directed movie .
"Joaquin Phoenix definitely deserves Oscar for his acting in this film. His expressions, his laugh and his dance is what gives u thrills and goosebumps. This movie was a masterpiece and Phoenix is incredible."
"The acting is insane! phoenix is brilliant,the oscar is 100%!i really did not expect the movie so genius! great movies didn't need CGI to storm the box office!!"
"Joaquins performance, what can you say? Oscar worthy.Incredible movie, the one we deserved."
"The joker film by Todd Phillips, is a great depiction of the famed DC villain. It added a twist unlike any joker film ever scene. The take on the character and the astonishing performance by Joaquin Phoenix, gave us a joker that we have wanted since Heath ledger. I really hope DC can develop a story that keeps the characters going in a series that we will enjoy!"
"The best movie i have ever seen in my life,honestly this movie shows real things with the best way possible.Good work DC continue like that STRONG!!!"
I don't remember the last time I was so emotionally attached to a movie. This is one of the best movies I've ever watched and I'm so happy I got a chance to see it in a theatre. Perfect.
"This was easily the best movie I have seen in so long. It is pure art from the beginning to the end. From the camerawork, to the plot, to the acting, this movie is far better than any of the junk on the market right now. It's worth Every single penny trust me. So good. So good. Sweet Caroline so good. Enjoy this once in a. Lifetime experience boys and girl/z. You won't regret it mwah"
This is one of the best movies ever made in my opinion. I got chills when i left the cinema. I absolutely recommend this movie for everyone!
"This should have been the title of the movie. This is by far... the best ""the making of"" film in movie history yet.For a character that is well known and one that everyone has an opinion off, no one definitely knows how this character came to being. This version of the character development is by far the best version so far, for so many reasons.For one. Joaquin Phoenix is brilliant in this role. He embodies the very essence of what the joker has been through, through the ages, to become who he is.The script and direction of this movie is brilliant. It even gives glimpse into the very reality of why the Gotham universe is the way it is. There are so many moments in this movie that makes one realise the universe of Gotham and Batman, Of why they lead to certain events.For those batman fans who grew up reading the comics... you're in for a real treat! The screenplay and direction is superb in telling a story of the joker that develops its roots of what makes him over the edge, while also dropping crucial points on what could influence the becoming of other characters. ... things a lot of us have never realised were even connected.I can't wait for batman now and I truly can't wait for the next time batman and joker meet in this universe created by Todd Phillips. Here's hoping they do, coz I truly can't wait to see the outcome knowing what I know now, about their becoming.This is truly a film not to miss, for those new to the genre but truly love movies of substance and character, and for those who truly love the Batman universe. Go watch it now!"
"Just seen Joker.
What can i say....I loved every second of this beautiful and depressing movie. Yes it's Phoenix from beginning til the end, but he playes Joker so convincingly, you could only feel for him, care for him and love him.
(And no, i am not mentally ill)The entire movie is exceptionally well made, the story, the setting, the music and yes... Joaquin's portrayal of the joker is undoubtedly the most disturbing, I've ever seen.Do not compare with Nicholson or Ledger (still favorite) just watch and let this Joker do the laughing.No joke, the Oscar goes to....."
"I think after ledger, that every great actor wants to play this part, todd phillips asked joaquin and here whe are!
a briljant movie... will be blowing minds for a long time...nuff said"
"There is so much that can be said about this spectacular film. Those who call it boring or dismiss it for being too violent are doing their best to quantify a piece of art they are not able to completely understand. Ennui only comes through disinterest and emotional/intellectual distance. The subtleties of Phoenix's performance to some, are undercut by his denial that he did not have to give himself to the role as much as previous Jokers have had to. People want a story of struggle and pain ending with high accomplishment. But the actor achieves this with skill and mastery of his craft. I'd watch the film again and again just to enjoy how Phoenix deftly makes be believe and empathise with a sociopath, a victim of circumstance in this interpretation.Brilliant cinematography and self-conscious homages to classic Scorsese masterpieces are testament to the wider scope Joker seeks to reach. The public seem so worried about how this film could incite violence and negative behaviour. My appreciation for the artistic calibre of this film resides it its ability to incite such controversy and opinion. Instead of shouting at the screen ask yourself why you feel the way you do and question your own tendencies rather than seek to project your insecurities on the world. What a film!"
"There have been many a Joker - from live action adaptations and animated adaptations - and this one, by Joaquin Phoenix, is the best one next to Heath Ledger's Joker. With this film released late in the year, perhaps Phoenix is a shoo-in for Best Actor. An excellent character study of a man battling a plethora of mental illnesses. Also, for those who have seen this movie, one question remains: How much of the movie is rooted in reality, and how much of it is in Arthur Fleck's mind? It's difficult to differentiate reality from fantasy."
"Tbh I have only one thing to say about this movie,
""Justice have been served"""
"It must have been a daunting task for Joaquin Phoenix to play such a complex depressed character and still manage to live up to the iconic role of Joker.I understand why many have misunderstood this movie, I have too. I saw it without having much sleep the night before and that is why I didn't grasp what was really being unveiled before my eyes.This is the kind of movie that requires full attention from start to finish. If you are the type to have your nachos, check your phone or even go to the toilet in the middle of a movie then just pass on this movie altogether and save everybody the half hearted critique.I have no idea how some have rated this 1. I mean even in my first visit, with my misunderstanding, it still was a good movie, just didn't realise HOW good!Only after my revisit, have I realised that I am witnessing the emergence of a timeless classic. Its too much to take in. No movie in the past decade has managed to break into the top 20 rated movies of all time( IMDB)( With the exception of Inception ). Joker has danced his way into the big leagues with ease.The writing is perfectly woven from start to finish. Everything in the movie adds up. It is a really depressing movie, a wake up call to those looking to wake up.The 1 star ratings given to this movie are by the ones who enjoy sleeping I guess, or just too scared to face the misery of reality outside the borders of their beds.This movie is just too much to comprehend. Your emotions will be tackled, your sympathy will be questioned, and your morals will definitely be in check.We don't live in this world alone, but many of us rather live pretending to.
The symbolism is refreshing and the lessons are intimidating.
It is a major mistake to compare Heath Ledger's Joker to Joaquin's. The plot and genre of both movies are totally different. Dark Knight's Joker was a cool, diabolic mastermind, a savage genius, full of charisma and dark humour. Not to take anything away from Heath's legendary performance, but the writing of Dark Knight, along with the sequence of events , really helped catapult Heath Ledger's Joker to an unprecedented summit. Imagine Heath Ledger playing the Joker with my writing? ... Exactly.Both actors have mastered their portrayal of Joker in their own way. No comparison is valid.Both actors have shown the dark side of the Joker.Joaquin was just too dark, too much.I have read somewhere that a critic said something on the lines of "" the world is not ready for a movie like Joker"", well spot on. Might I add, the world is a circus and Joker is the elephant in the room.
Lets just enjoy the fact that there are two Jokers in the top 20 rated movies of all time.This is the kind of movie you would want to watch again and again and again. Not because you're insane, but because the world is, and your sanity is just too precious.Joke UhOne last point:SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILERMy take on the final Crash scene:When mental healthcare is trivialized or overlooked ,(Ambulance)Security becomes in jeopardy (police)And in turn,People will find it hard to move around(Taxi)And society will ultimately become paralysed.Finally,Don't forget to smile."
"This movie is so incredibly well done that I am writing a comment on IMDb for the first time. I truly have no words, or more like I want to say so many things that I dont even know where to begin.
Please watch it if you havent already, its the best thing you'll watch in a long time."
"Joaquin Phoenix is excellent, this is the best movie you will see this year.
This movie is a visual treatise on mental heath, abuse and social marginalisation. It has not much to do with DC and the fictional character. It perfectly explores how a human being can unravel into a sociopath. They could have easily called it 'Making a madman' or something.Not sure why they picked the 1980s but it worked well, the music is excellent and quite diverse in parts. Grimy downtrodden NY/Gotham looks awesome and suits the story.Heath Ledger was excellent previously but this film is rooted in brutal reality and it is so different to everything that came before that it is justified as a standalone masterpiece."
"This movie is astonishing,
This movie managed to tie all loose ends. The outstanding acting makes the movie so much more believable and realistic, and every character is designed perfectly and have major role in the plot.
The camera shots in this film are perfect, mostly wide blurred shots slowly creeping in making it so much more disturbing.
Plot - This movie is so disturbing and gritty just as it should be, it shows what really can happen in life when a person with mental health issues or even a healthy person that has hit rock bottom and has no one to help them 'back' up.The message is perfect for the times we live in, in 2019, the rich and healthy should not be separated from the sick and poor; from the mentally challenged. We should live in a society where anyone can be helped and anyone can be heard no matter what level they stand at, before they spiral."
"JOKER 2019Joaquin Phoenix, Todd Philips & Scott Silver's JOKER is the ULTIMATE punchline to the 'joke' called society. It is a bold, raw, devastating and hauntingly beautiful character study, a social commentary and a flawless masterpiece - a cinematic achievement in the 100 years of cinema. It unfolds very very slowly but as it does, it punches you in the guts, punches you hard.Let me go back to one and a half year or more ago when they announced the movie. Being a hardcore Joker fan, I wasn't overly excited as I knew (as did everyone) that it is not possible to outdo Heath Ledger's performance as Joker. I was still intrigued as I heard Martin Scorcese was involved and Joaquin Phoenix was cast as the role with Robert De Niro in it. I wanted that different, crime-driven version. Then, over the course of last 12 months LOTs and LOTs of leaked photos and behind-the-scenes footages came out, and I wasn't quite liking what I saw. The production team seemed lazy as per security and keeping secret, something someone like Christopher Nolan wouldn't do. Then I heard that the script was being rewritten almost every day (which is usually a recipe for disaster) and my expectations were further down and it wasn't even my most anticipated this year, then there was the matter of confidence on Director Todd Philips who directed the crime-driven comedy 'The Hangover'. THEN, the unexpected happened and we got to see the first trailer and the second. And then, last month, the reviews came in, the movie won an 8 minute standing ovation from Venice Film Festival screening and won the 'Golden Lion'. Some of the hardest reviewers gave it full marks and called it either a masterpiece, or a cinematic achievement, or that a comic book movie has never been done in such way, and this opens up new doors and changes the movie industry forever. Well....whatever you heard and read are all true.Joaquin Phoenix gave a performance that cannot be described in words, even if I talk about it in person I will fail to describe it. I have never seen any performance like this, and I watch a LOT of cinemas. He did something impossible to the character that left us all awestruck and in disbelief. His version of Joker is of course different (the greatness of Joker character is - it is multi layered and can be approached in different ways) but if I'd have to compare it, it goes on par with Heath Ledger's Joker or maybe even outshines him. If I consider the best actors (Oscar Winners) for the last few years namely, Matthew Mcconaughey, Mahershala Ali, or Rami Malek, they were all brilliant but Phoenix outshines them all (little known fact, Phoenix did almost all his shots in single takes :O). Joaquin Phoenix has BECOME Joker. My sincere gratitude to Todd Philips, as whatever rewrites and plans he did, it came out as a beautiful bright art. It took him a whole year to convince Warner Brothers to greenlight the movie and 5 visits to Joaquin Phoenix's house to convince him. His depiction of Gotham city is raw, filthy and perfect. Cinematography also is Oscar worthy and so is the story. Hildur Guðnadóttir's unforgettable score for the movie not only is a perfection but it almost literally talks to you during moments, especially during times when you're confused as to what is going on inside Arthur Fleck's (Joker) mind.Joaquin Phoenix's Joker will sadden you, cheer you, scare you, haunt you, and finally leave you scarred. Yes this movie is not for everyone and of course children should definitely avoid it. In the end, you will not know how much of it you can believe or was real, it leaves you to your imagination. So if you think this Joker has a definitive origin as opposed to Heath Ledger's mysterious Joker.....wrong, it leaves you to interpret it on your own way. When there is chaos we always try to point it all to someone, in JOKER though you wouldn't know whether you should point you finger to the society or Joker himself. When everything spirals out of control do you still endure it, or do you cross that thin line, or do you put a bullet through your head, what would YOU do given the same situation, because Arthur Fleck is one of us. Therein lies the mastery of the movie. During the final punchline of it you will roar as we all did - WE ARE ALL CLOWNS, LET'S PUT ON A HAPPY FACE.As Arthur would say ""I used to think my life was a tragedy, now I know it's a comedy"", apart from what this line represents, the final shot of the movie ends with a comedy. This movie will win multiple awards and Oscars as per my prediction and will be talked about for years. Indeed, one of the greatest cinematic achievement created with a $ 55 million budget. Don't wait for blu-ray, run to the theaters and believe me, it is worth every single penny of yours. This movie is disturbingly real, and relatable.I've seen it 3 times already and still stuck with the HAHAs in my head. I'm giving it a 10/10."
Saw this movie in the after noon the week after it's release. Yea very disturbing and unsettling but what do you expect from a movie that has a mentally psycho clown in the front and center? I freaking loved every minute of this movie. Even Gotham looked fantastic and I think this is the best looking Gotham ever. Sorry Chris Nolan even though you made the best Batman films. Phoenix really sold it. His portrayal of the Joker was completely realistic and all of his laughs were so well done. The story was great as well. I highly recommend this film
"Everything that has to be praised has. Joaquin's performance and psychological angle. But, the media seems to think the message of the movie is to spread violence and chaos. It's not, the message is to show kindness and compassion to others because you're negative actions could create a new joker."
"Best Movie of the year. A must see for all cinema fans. Joaquin's performance is mind blowing. Joker is ""the rare comic book movie that expresses what's happening in the real world"". I see it as a good representation for today's bullying and how evil, we are as human beings."
"I left the theater stunned speechless. There really isn't an adequate way to describe Phoenix's genius portrayal of the Joker. I can say there were an abundance of moments when the hair on my arms literally stood up, moments when I could not breathe. See this movie for no other reason than to watch the mastery of his work. We will never meet or know a character like Joker, but Phoenix will bring you as close as you can be to true madness without losing your life. If he does not receive the Oscar for this role, it is only because of fear."
"From beginning to end, Joker will have all of your attention and you will be blown away. An origin for the ages! Dark, stark, harsh and real."
"A roller coaster. Not a second of this film left us wanting, it was possibly one of the best films I've ever seen. The Joker is just an amazing character."
Being a guy that's only hobby is to watch movies I can say that this is one of the best movies I've seen in the last 30 years
"This movie is a masterpiece. Joaquin Phoenix did an amazing job, and he totally has to get an Oscar for it! Best movie I have ever seen!"
"Scrolling down Instagram and Facebook you might come across this quote ""Put on a happy face"", ""Whenever happens you should smile"" and this quotes are the main theme of JOKER. The film begins with Arthur aka joker laughing and you can feel every emotion joker's laugh had except the emotion of happiness cause joker is not happy from inside and that's why he is going under 7 medications even though if it's not helping him. Acting - Acting is top notch, it's something you might have never seen before. Joaquin phoenix is quite old in age and that's why in close up you can see linings on his face and you can see how those linings make his laugh, and sadness more effective. With facial expressions there are macro expressions which you can notice on close up and those macro expressions shows the class of acting this guy has done. Music - Background music is top notch the song ""Send in the clowns"" fits perfectly with the theme and in some part the background score so perfect that it glorify the scene for example the scene where Arthur is checking his gun n there is this music played in TV shows which helps to intensify the mood. Makeup and lighting is even perfect after The dark knight if there's something everyone was talking the most after heath ledger's acting then it's his makeup. He himself did the makeup so it can be realistic and in this Joker makeup is good, simple, subtle and perfect according to the script, some small details makes you a fan of the make up artist like painting a kind of tear drop under the eye bags and at some places the right eye's blue colour is slightly spread because of joker's tears. The lighting makes you feel it's a 90's setting and dark film. Unpredictable storyline - Just like Spiderman far from home this film has lots of surprises for you and you cannot say what will happen next, anything can happen at any point and it is so balanced that you don't feel like there is too many surprises. The first half is quite slow but makes you feel pity over Arthur, the mental and laughing condition of Arthur and the way the people treats him makes you question about your way of treating people like that. The best thing of the film is it hasn't shown Joker has a hero they have shown him, it has shown him as a person who is the biggest villian of Batman and the reason behind his attitude. The film leaves the descision on you wheather what he is doing right or not and everything in the film is perfect and balanced and you cannot argue on that. If you like to see dark film and writes stories or you wanna be an actor then this is a must watch."
"The movie that you will never forget
The main character was legendary and great
Qoaquin Phoenix i have nothing to say about his iconic performance
Everything is 10/10"
"Well, this review will not contain any spoilers, although I must say, if you read it, just don't complain me for this poor society that we live in. This is, with absolutely no doubt, one of the movies of the century, one of the movies that has no precedent, just art, just a true show about the real downsides of this society, and still, humanity keeps failing, over and over again...I already know, that we (humans), don't have the same tastes, the same ideologies, and the same problems, but it's a bit shameful see the younger, just arguing (and with no real arguments whatsoever), that this movie is just boring, non interesting, and non relevant.Sometimes, we have to grow, to understand the real sadness, to understand the madness, the provocative world that we live in, but unfortunately some of the youngest have real problems, and I've already been there.For those who find this movie quite forgettable, just leave the cinema, and continue to see your favourite movies.For those, who can't get the job done (like, reading some info), before the movie session, try to do so on a future visit.Art is art. Madness is madness. And Joker is Joker."
"So sad movie, so we'll done,. J.P is so good in this roll. I was amazed. You feel him, he's a good person. No feel good movie but a few laughs.Best I seen. #how much can a person take"
"A brilliant use of current problems in capitalist societies, sheer the rich want to get even richer and so they demand governments and councils use austerity on the masses to fuel tax cuts for the rich.
One specific result is the cuts to services that help those with mental illness. Hence Joaquin Phoenix's character depends into an abyss from which the Joker emerges.
The dance sequence down the long set of steps to the Glitter Bands Rock and Roll (part 1 & 2), beats anything Fred Astaire could do.If Joaquin Phoenix doesn't get an Oscar for this, then scrap the Oscars."
The film is very beautiful. I think I will not watch a movie of this level in the next five years
It was masterpiece. This movie there just like once in years. DC once again make another good quality movie after dark knight. And I've watch it on theatre more than twice. Beautiful. Beautiful.
"If you enjoyed Taxi Driver then go see this film. Simple as that. Don't listen to anyone else about how dark or violent it is because everyone has a had a dark time in their life that they tried to be ""happy"" through."
"The Joker is just brilliant!! the plot of the story is excellent. Deep story touched your soul and make ur mind think! Much respect to the directer Todd Phillips 👏👏 he's just genius! And Joaquin Phoenix is just insane! He deserves to get the Oscar for his Super top performance and great acting in this movie 👌👏.. Also the music was nice.. Everything was great, It is one of the best movies i ever seen in all time, I really enjoyed it and you must watch it if you are looking for real story! Nothing to say more! 🤡"
"Eversince Phoenix was attached to play the iconic Joker, I was eagerly waiting for this film. I had high expectations in terms of acting in the film and I was completely blown away after seeing it. This film is the best of the year and will be a cult classic in coming years. Direction is near perfect and cinematography is beautifully poetic as expected from a DC movie. You dive into the 80s Gotham and see the world through Arthur's eyes. You witness his transformation into the Joker and the reasons behind it. The end of the movie will make you think what's real and what's fantasy as they say joker has a multiple origin stories. Not sure about Best Picture but expect Academy Award for the Best Actor for Joaquin Phoenix."
"Where to begin. An essential story that had to be told. Not because its the Joker. Not because its DC or Batman related. Because it is current.What is more important for film than to lure with one illusion, only to present something unexpected yet essential. The Joker does this effortlessly. Even if the Joker wasn't a well known character this production would have worked. The movie presents a picture for something very prevalent in global western society today; the disintegration of societal values, structure, and security and its human impact on the less privileged in society.Arthur is the ultimate anti-hero and through his journey emerges as perhaps a more powerful hero than his arch nemesis to be. A David v Goliath type story. A hero is after all someone who stands up for the weak, injustice and those who cant stand up for themselves; Arthur has these traits, though not in a conventional sense. The weak in his story is him; what greater hero than someone who stands up for themselves and emerges triumpant ? My statement will of course have many people screaming given Arthur's chosen methods. What underlies it all is a person fighting back the only way they know how, once they've been pushed too far; at the story's core, Arthur is simply screaming for ""help"".What about mental health you shout? He is totally messed up and off his meds. Of course, because mental health is just something that is the cause not the result? Mental health is correlated to societal values, function and security. Arthur's mental health is the result of his environment, so we are all to blame for Arthur's situation."
"By far the best movie this year. This should be the starting story of creating the Joker. It's supposed to make a new movie where it relaxes that tension and creates a sick mind of something resembling the Heath ledger joker. Where he becomes a psychopath but leads a group of people off the street and is the most evil supervillain. This type of dancing smoke bomb, pistol and all those magician clown stuff that go with it. With some kind of horror puzzle mix, but it hasn't been copied."
"Loved it. Hard to describe. It is rare these days that they make a movie that is more art than commercial. Phoenix's acting is sublime. He makes you feel familiar with the character. Like you know him personally, feel his pain.
This is going to go down as an all time classics and one of the darkest movies of our era."
"It's rare for me to give a movie 10 stars, but Joker is totally worth it.
It is a very strong drama movie that won't let you move your eyes for a second. the music and sounds affects are genius,
adding a lot to the general atmosphere - first when you get to know the Joker
and how everything is going horribly wrong.
It got to the part of the movie that there are supposedly comedy parts, but the director wants you to feel how it is wrong and not really funny.
The movie really make you get to know the joker's personality and creeps you out.
I watched it yesterday and I still get chills up my spine thinking of some of the scenes."
"Normally, it helps me more to put DC or Marvel movies under a different category from other movies to be fair when I rate them, but this one was really on another level. A great script that gave us a deep story, well-organized chapters, superb acting performance and yes it was based on comics!
Even though it's a slow-paced movie, I didn't feel like there's a slow buildup in any chapters, which is not easy to avoid in these kinds of dark drama movies. Joaquin took the movie to another level, and it's really fair enough to say it's 'Joaquin's movie'. He really made every scene counted on the screen. I can't remember any scene was there just to help the story, not his character. Everything in the movie should be about him, and that's what he did.
When I watched the movie in the cinema, there were mixed emotions between the audience for most of the scenes. You don't know if you should laugh? or feel sad. These stressful situations were greatly made with the help of Joaquin's performance. He was always in control of these kinds of situations and when things require outsourcing support, the soundtrack comes in the right moment. Hildur made a great job by giving the soundtrack theme a character that I felt personally it's a little bit inspired by Hans Zimmer's masterpiece the Dark Knight, but with a more slow pace and dark feel.
I liked how during each chapter there were these scenes that look like some encaustic or painting to recap the joker personality changes.
Some people are saying the story is not 100% loyal to the comic, but what's wrong with that? Make a nice movie and implement all film success factors then I'm more than satisfied.
The only thing that I felt is not 100% complete after watching the movie for the second time is the last 20 min. I think it was necessary for an extra 15 or a maximum of 20 min for the last Joker personality transformation. But maybe the writer wanted to focus on what things that made the Joker as he is instead of the Joker himself. So yeah it's fine.
I know there are obvious ideas that can be reflected in other ones in the Taxi Driver movie, but it's really been used brilliantly. If someone watched the two movies and focused on the last Joker chapter, he will understand why I'm saying that.
It's really hard - without considering the comics' loyalty thing - to not give this film a full mark. It's been years since I watched a deep movie like this one.
I had a big question after I finished the movie, what's wrong in having a good script that leaves the freedom for actors to give a stunning performance in superhero movies? What's wrong with a good deep story instead of just counting on CGI? A lot of people are really starving for a well-written drama superhero movie. I hope Joker can help in this direction."
"Damn, just,,, damn! This is my first review, probably because this is the first movie since I signed up that motivated me to do so. It's also the third movie that I've given a perfect rating for. At my age (44), I exclusively watch comic book, Science Fiction, Science Fantasy and Fantasy. If I want Drama, all I need to do is analyze life, I want films to take me someplace unknown. With Joker I mistakenly thought that I would be getting a comic book movie, how wrong I was a pleasantly surprised too.I have no other way to describe Joker than to say it is a masterpiece. Everyone involved in its making gets top marks from me and my thanks."
"Specifically created an account to give this a rating. 10 stars might be too high, but 9 stars felt too low so I will give it 10 stars. The cinematography, music and acting is all absolutely top notch. The movie grips you from start to end, bravo!"
Incredible movie im speechless diffidently deserves to be in top 5 movies !!!!!
"I'm truly speechless, its a hype which take you to other world."
"Best movie ever , the story the acting it makes u feel that he's an important person to you and makes u feel sympathetic about his feelings"
"Just a Great big 2019 movie....
-
Oscar is Coming, I love it"
"This movie deserves an oscar. Breathtaking cinematography. And the acting of Joaquin Pheonix is incredible. The character is evolved beautifully during the movie, I did not want it to end."
"Joaquin Phoenix truly deserves to win an Oscar for this. To act and perform the way as the ""Joker"" was special! I don't think any other actor could of done it the way he did. He touched everybody's soul and the film has a meaning to it. It gives a chance for people to realise that mental illness is a thing. Never judge a person and to be kind to one another because you just never know what a person is going through.10/10"
"I was reading DC Comics since 10, I am 37 now and I can say that this version of the Joker is almost as good as Heath Ledgers one!The Joker character is such a complex and disturb one but is so difficult to dislike him, it has such a range of personalities and is so charismatic...I enjoyed so much Jack Nicholson as the Joker, I idolize the Ledgers one and honestly this one is almost as good..., Depends on the taste I should say, like a good wine or art... But even if you don't know nothing about this character or comics is a must see! The performances are outstanding, the plot is tremendous and the most important thing it shows so many faces of our society! A must!"
"Who does not understand this movie runs blindly through the world ....
A masterpiece!"
"This is such an important film. Not just for an amazing look into the depths of a character we know little about but also for awareness of how we act around others and mental illness. A great film; dark, twisted and a story that's beautifully told and shot. An abolute masterpiece of modern cinema."
"For years is No Country for Old Men my #1 movie of all time. Anton Chigurh still makes me freak out every time he flips his coin. Is not different in this movie.
Actually I have the same feeling watching Joker and the second time I went to the movie it felt like it was even faster ended, which is a good thing.
Jomer is raw, painfull and has a very good message to the world. If you don't get your eyes opened after watching this, it can be the other critics got their message right, which is to not let you see what's going on 'til today.About No Country for Old Men: it still has a special place in my heart, but I am pretty sure Joker will stay as #1 for a long time."
Best movie I've seen in a long time. I didn't think there would ever be another Joker as good as Heath Ledger's adaptation (may he rest in peace) but this movie proved me wrong.
"Despite the fact that I went into this film with very high expectations I was still blown out of the water. Joaquin was amazing, the cinematography was outstanding and the writing was so perfectly linked to Christopher Nolan's batman trilogy. How this is rated poorly by critics blows my mind it clearly shows that critics are biased. Some bad reviews spoke about how the film was too dark and sadistic but that's merely the whole point of joker. He portrays a sadistic psychopath who has been pushed around in an unforgiving place and causes him to rebel. 10/10 best film of the year."
"This movie is an absolute piece of art I've never been Soo happy and thrilled to see a movie until this
it's defrent and real and just amazing"
"Despite being a DC movie, this is not your typical superhero vs. villain CGI fest.
This is a film about a man with mental illness who has suffered abuse, neglect and intolerance and his eventual decline into criminal insanity.
If you enjoy movies like Scorsese's Taxi Driver or King of Comedy, then this is for you. If your expecting another Dark Knight, you will be disappointed.
It's set in a beautifully shot dark and bleak Gotham City and is an absolute masterclass in acting from Joaquin Phoenix."
"This movie is truly a modern masterpiece. Joaquin Phoenix does justice to Joker where Heath Ledger left off. But I wouldn't want to compare both their performances as many have already said, ""It would be like comparing apples to oranges."" But I at least know that Heath Ledger can rest easy in heaven knowing Joaquin brought the character under a new light with his phenomenal performance. Todd Phillips and Joaquin Phoenix have really outdone themselves with this new take on The Joker. Joaquin and Todd bring a whole new aspect to Joker that has never really been talked about before, tackling the issue and importance of mental illness and a few other problems with modern society. And to address all the fear-mongering the media throws towards this movie, ignore it. Most of it isn't even relevant towards the actual movie and much of it are lies. I couldn't recommend another movie to watch over Joker. This movie will not disappoint. In fact, it goes above expectations (surely went over mine). Case in point, please consider giving this film a watch. I can't recommend this movie enough."
"A great great movie with amazing acting
Best movie in a long time .
Best movie for this year for sure ."
Brilliant film. It deserves all the positive reviews it's getting. Joaquin Phoenix was amazing in this. Oscar worthy performance
"There is no balance in this movie, 2 hours of chaos, you leave the movie theater in pain, without resolution. This movie might help you to accept the reality that you have been denying since you remember yourself, this movie may help you to accept yourself as you are."
"Joker
2019
15
director : Todd Phillips
starring: Joaquin phoenix,Robert de niro, Zaze beetz,Frances Conray,Brett Cullenoverall rating 99/100The joker is about mentally unstable Arthur Fleck ( Joaquin phoenix) on trying to reach his dream of becoming a stand up comedian. But when things in his life dont go his way and his mental health deteriorates the joker clown is unleashed.Wow this movie was a masterpiece in every component i never thought my favourite movie of the year would be a DC movie but this film really shocked me at its artistry and brilliance lets talk about why this is.First of all the film had an absolutely incredible score. Wow the soundtrack really left an impact in the most important scenes in the film. When there was something uncomfortable or important happening on the screen the score got louder and louder. And i especially enjoyed the score when Joaquian phoenix became the complete joker. It made you excited for what he was going to do and added important to the final act.Next the film was actually pretty funny. Some of the comedy jokes within the film mostly landed. And Robert de niro added excellent comedic moments to the movie as well as his fantastic acting. His sarcastic comments definitely drew some laughs from me despite him suffering the repercussions of making these jokes about Arthurs character i just thought he added a nice dynamic to the movie.Next i thought the movie had excellent character development for the lead role and the female character (Zaze Beetz) was a great addition to the movie as well. I thought Zazes character did a really good job with what little screen time she had. She kind of was the main reason for Arthur not going completely insane for half of the movie and if she wasn't a character he would of went mad much more quickly. Next Arthurs character development was fantastic. To see his slow decent into madness throughout the film really left an impact with me. So many things in his life was going wrong that from my perspective i understood why he snapped. From losing his job to realising dark secrets about his mum it was really interesting to see how his mental health slowly got worse and worse.Next the plot twist and final act were fantastic and definitely the best parts of the movie aside from Joaquin phoenix being fantastic. I thought the plot twist of Sophie never actually being beside Arthur was a really interesting twist. As she was keeping him relatively sane throughout the movie but with this twist it just proves he was mad all along so that was great. And the final act was just fantastic when Arthur transformed completely into the joker it was just fantastic. He had a fantastic script he looked fantastic and terryfying and the events left me satisfied with the ending. The gore also added a lot of impact to a lot of the scenes and added a fatality realistic portrayal of violence in modern society.Next the film had an excellent balance between sympathy and fear of Arthurs character. With all the events that was happening to him at the beginning and the fact that he couldn't control his laughing to it being a condition you couldn't help but feel sorry for him. But this sympathy soon turned to fear of what he is capable off when he is off his medication and the film did a brilliant job of balancing these two out therefore being tonally consistent. Adding onto that the film executed an incredible tense and uncomfortable tone throughout. Wow this film had you on edge throughout. Whether it was the haunting laugh of Arthur. Or his disformed body. The film really put you in a place of discomfort which i loved as that was i believe the directors desired passive reaction for the audience.Next the cinematography and visuals were stunning. There was some really stunning shots in this film largely close ups of the joker that really were fantastic to look at. The films colour palette was fantastic as well it was just a very well shot and directed movie.Now next is not a negative more like a realisation. Now i understand why this film is causing some controversy in some aspects but a lot of people are taking it to far. I can see how it can be taken the wrong way in terms of supporting violence and anybody who watches the film in a similar situation to Arthur may take the film very literally but in my opinion this was not the films main goal. As i believe it a more harsh and realistic portrayal of how dangerous modern society is and this themes was portrayed excellently. And really made me think and question about how mad and dangerous society and the whole world is in this day and age.Now for my final two positives. Firstly i loved that they involved young batman in this story. His interactions with the joker was fantastic and it saddened me that they wont meet again on screen. And seeing his parents deaths again was sad to see but also bought back nostalgia from previous batman movies.And finally the best part of this film was of course Joaquin Phoenix. Wow he was truly incredible here. He really put every escene of his being into making his interpretation of the joker his own. And boy did he do a good job. He found a way to differentiate himself from all the other portrayals and matches the legendary performance of Heath Ledger. He was commited to the role and clearly lost a lot of weight. And his acting was the reason the film had such a uncomfortable tone as it was so believable. You could see the madness in his eyes and that intensity and madness got more and more recognisable as the movie went on he definitely deserves at least an oscar nomination but really a win for this.Overall the joker is a true cinematic masterpiece that is pretty much perfect. Filled with excellent performances/themes and visuals and it really proves that the standard of DC movies is improving rapidly."
I can't believe what happening here .. all I can say that's the movie is a masterpiece.
"This is kind of movies you watch over and over again, the soundtrack, the vintage footage of the 70s'/80s'
And above all the acting of Juaquin phoenix ... stunning 🤡👺🤡"
"It's very interesting to watch a talented actor depict a compelling and unique character falling into madness. This kind of movie heavily depends on the actor's performance so I was worried if Joaquin could pull it off, but he really exceeded my expectations.One of those movies that I couldn't get enough of after watching it, don't think I'll get easily tired of discussing about the it and watching clips or the whole thing again."
"The movie is too dark, awkwardness leaks in every single minute of it...However, it delivers a very clear and strong message that cannot be mistaken.The purely genuine performance of the Joker adds to its darkness & beauty."
I went along to this thinking it was a Marvel type offering. How wrong I was. Totally immersed in this film to the point of being overwhelmed by emotion.One of the best movie experiences I have ever had.
"This is a great piece of art! The cinematography was absolutely breathtaking! Joaquin Phoenix is definitely one of the best actor period, his performance was out of this world."
"MASTERPIECE!!! The acting, cinematography, script, and the original score is phenomenal!!! This movie is triumph."
"Todd Phillip's Joker is strange, gripping, and unlike the films it shares its comic book category. Grounded by a world that's hard to look at, littered with sure-to-be-iconic character shots, fueled by a heart breaking performances, and sewn together by a near perfect score; Joker is sure to both divide and captivate audiences for decades to come"
"I came into the theater expecting to be a bit disappointed. Seeing people in droves rate this movie as a masterpiece made me think this would be another overblown DC flick but my low expectations were put to shame. This is a film that is unlike anything i have seen in the past years. This is a visceral, haunting film that will be very difficult to forget. My eyes were practically glued to the screen. I didn't want to miss a single detail. Seeing Arthur Fleck's transformation into the Clown Prince of Gotham is downright masterful. I cannot recall character development done so effectively, yet realistically. You comprehend Fleck's motives, even if you don't agree with the harsh extent to which he takes them. You see how society could craft such an individual. How our society could isolate and destroy an Arthur Fleck. Although Fleck has mental issues, within the first half of the film he wishes to cause no harm and only wants to follow his dream to make people laugh. Of course the majority of credit has to go to Joaquin Phoenix. His work is tremendous. The laugh, the mannerisms. Phoenix portrays Fleck like a real person. A tormented person who has received much trauma over his life, and how a series of unfortunate events finally cause him to snap. How he tried to smile through the pain until the pain made him smile. It's a brilliant performance that deserves every award across the board. I never thought someone could come close to Ledger's work, but Phoenix possibly surpasses Ledger. I could go into great detail about the terrific music choices, the score, the cinematography which captures Gotham oh so well, the directing, and even De Niro's work. Everything clicked. There's no false not. It built to a such a powerful climax i had goosebumps among a crowded theater. This is a decade defining film, and one unlike anything you'll see again in quite some time. Let's hope the Oscars do the right thing."
Made an account just to post this review for the best movie I've ever seen in my life.
We needed a movie like this one for a long time and we got a movie that deserves all the wait.
"This movie is a masterpiece. Best movie I've seen my whole life. Joaquin Phoenix is just beyond amazing, the best acting I've ever seen from any actor ever! Must see."
We all have known joker character from many movies(Especially my favorite Heath Ledger) but this one is the B!!!(I m not going to say that but hard to digest & the hype is real) Well...what a character development... Specially the transformation to JOKER... Hats off to Joaquin Phoenix.. This guy deserves an Oscar really...
"Joaquin is something else I stand for him and raise my hat to his acting skills he never ever disappoint you, there's nothing I can say or describe this movie but a masterpiece. Please watch it and open your heart and embrace him he deserves it."
I went to the movie with high expectations from the overall positive reviews and it still blow my mind.Joaquin Phoenix with an Oscar worthy performance.Not to forget the absolute brilliance of the team behind the movies soundtrack.Well done. Very well done.
"I did not find a single scene that I did not like, the photography in this movie is excellent. I cried in the beginning, I only laughed 3 or 4 times (no forced jokes) and i left the cinema complete. You see the side b of gotham's past and although you can empathize with Arthur but only the politically correct thing could complain about such a jewel, it bothers them but we love it. The comic genre needs more movies like this and less comedy."
"Modern America is like Murray show where opinions are created for greater masses & every difference is looked upon with contempt. Such is mindless campaign to boycott a movie because it will provoke violence in a country where gun can be bought while shopping for groceries.Joker is examination of people's behavior towards those in need, sick individuals who are pushed to the margins just because they need help. While city is choking in garbage, funds are being cut on social help & medical care, elite in suits are smiling while watching Chaplin. Wayne is not different then the others and he's finally given human approach rather then all good hero that tried to save Gotham in all other creations.There are no heroes in this movie, there is no light at the end of tunnel & there is no sympathy for titular character but rather a big punch in the face from Todd Phillips to all of us who are actually living in our own Murray show day in day out without ever taking time to reflect what surrounds us.Joker is a must see movie that will make you think about times we live in, about our role in the system & the ones on top never liked ordinary thinking people. Burton took his Joker straight from comics as he fell in acid, but Phillips only needed to put his protagonist in today's world.So who's laughing now?"
"""you are making fun of it, but it was serious to me""dem this scene still gives me chills since last night.
its rare to spot a good thriller with a decent suspense and ending nowadays, guess Christopher Nolan has raised the bar too high.but maaaan, Joaquin and Todd have just proved me wrong, Joker wasn't just great, but motha-****ingly AMAZING. The performance, cinematography, screenplay, storyline, music etc were absolutely stunning. It's not just a movie but also a whistleblower, a HUGE message to the world out there of what's still going on in our society.you can't compare Joaquin to Heath, they are both Ronaldo and Messi. If Joaquin doesn't win the Oscar and Joker doesn't win AT LEAST the best screenplay, it'll be the biggest joke of all time.Joker is something else."
"I mean what the hell...
This is definitely the most amazing movie ever made about a comicbook supervillain.
The character development, the turning points, everything is just freaking amazing about this movie.
That ending, joker dancing on car's hood, putting that smile with his blood on his face. Goosebumps...
And don't get me started on Phoenix's performance.
Phoenix definitely deserves an oscar for his performance in this movie.
The best 2019 movie so far..."
This movie is only boring to those that are used to action. This movie for those who really know the Joker. That this movie was a beautiful narrative told from his perspective. Highly recommend to keep that in mind if you don't know if you should watch it.
This film is incredible. It's harshly criticised for no reason. This film will impact modern cinema.
"I cant even start with this... Its simply a remarkable work...one that i feel so thankful with lífe to be able to experience...
Joaquín Is something out of this World.. i dont know what the critics are smoking with their nonsensical reviews.."
"Best Joker ever! He deserves an Oscar!
I will come back in cinema to see this movie again and again"
"I had avoided all the trailers and press on this film and in all honestly, didn't expect much from it. DC films haven't been the greatest over the past lot of years and here we are again with WB trying to go down another route to try and make something of it...Well - I'm only glad they did.Joker is quite simply one of the finest pieces of film I have seen in a long time - especially from Hollywood, which isn't too often. From Joaquin's incredible performance (just amazing), to the stunning cinematography and score, I just can't think of a single moment that lost me.Well done Todd Phillips and team, and well done Joaquin for the greatest performance of the Joker ever!"
"Masterpiece... , The acting is brilliant , the story is enjoyable , The Movie is just One of the best Movies Ever Made"
"The story is immerse and is filled with emotions. Joaquin Pheonix completely sweeps you into joker's sufferings, rage, grief with his incredible performance. The movie forces you to think about living life from emotionally troubled person's perspective. It's a must watch movie. And the ending is one of the greats."
"A real masterpiece. I have been waiting for this movie since Joaquin Phoenix's laughing trailer came out, and i am more than happy to see well worth the wait. Phoenix's performance is hard to forget and we are lucky to see this performance with a great script on the big screen.We watched Batman saving Gotham and sad background of Bruce Wayne's life million times. This film shows and asks a simple question; what if Gotham deserves Joker more than Batman?Lastly; Joaquin Phoenix should win Oscar after this. I don't think any other option would be fair."
"This film was a pice of art. Each frame looked like a painting. Unbelievable acting, story and cinematography. Love it 10/10!"
"There is no ""superhero"" movie even close to this masterpiece.
I went to the theaters yesterday with an extremely high expectation, because everybody is talking about it.
The movie is a masterpiece! The script, the ""connections"" (you'll understand), the acting (my god... what a acting!), the story and even the music.
Heath Ledger Joker was perfect until yesterday.Now perfection was updated for me.See the movie!"
"This was irresponsible filmmaking at its finest coming at the worst possible time. Todd Phillips should be ashamed. He had the opportunity to offer a positive message to people that see themselves in Arthur's shoes- people that have been wronged by the system and see no way out- and instead he reassured them that they are monsters and the only way they can ""win"" is if they get back at the society that wronged them in any way they can. He's a cash grabber that used his platform to tell an entertaining Joker story, instead of a deeper resonate message like it could have been. From an outsider's view, one could argue that this scenario is what happens when society fails, but this was not told from an outsider's view. This was told from the terribly empathetic Arthur's view, and so I see no reason why a potential school shooter wouldn't relate to him. This is saying to that person, it's better to be infamous than a nobody. It's a very dangerous message at this current time. For those that argue, it's only art, I argue that the mainstream media is potentially the most powerful force in the entire world. Personally, I feel that with great power comes great responsibility. Media makers have the right to make whatever they want, but they have the responsibility to use the power they've been given for good and this was completely the opposite...Objective review: Beautifully shot and acted, but super boring at times."
"So I really didn't enjoy the Joker movie and definitely can understand the people being upset. In my opinion it sucks people in thinking they'll see a comic book type movie, just as a marketing ploy and then leans heavily on trying to randomly include source material via namedropping ""Wayne"" . Then it's similar to the Movie Taxi Driver (made with Denerio) about a guy that goes crazy and kills people and is then celebrated for it and glorifies violence as ""deserving it and embraced by people who understand and condone murder"" not even entertaining in that just wallowes in self pity and shifting of blame for actions. If you want to make a movie like that, it can be done and done well obviously since it's taken from another movie. But don't try and use connections to comic books to increase the crowd draw and then expect people to be ok with it. Saying its societies fault when someone who deserves to be institutionalized and would be in real life and that society condones murder and it's not the killers fault is tone deaf in this day and age. Plots progression is unbelievable acting is great for sure."
"I would consider myself an avid film fan and in my 37 years, I have been privileged to watch many classic films that have an x-factor and capture the zeitgeist at the time. Some films are just beautifully put together and the combination of image and sound work together to create something more than its parts.Joker has the x-factor and works almost perfectly as a film. Seeing as perfect doesn't exist, this is as good as it gets. Throw in a performance on a Daniel Day-Lewis level and you have something very special. It clearly draws from Scorsese's work in the 1970s (Taxi Driver, The King of Comedy etc) but also has a very relevant social commentary about mental illness, the rich/poor divide and shared responsibility.The critical backlash after the initial praise is strange, but feels like a concerted effort to distance themselves from a film that could be too hot to handle. However, the people clearly disagree and the universal praise is totally deserving.This is a transportative and transformative film that looks backwards to redefine a genre and create a gem of a film. It's dark, depressing and glorious all at the same time."
Yes I am that blown away by Joaquin! But I am not surprised! When I found out they casted him I was like PERFECT CHOICE!!!!!!!!! He actually got me to become a fan of Johnny Cash! My fav scene is the dancing on the steps! Hilarious! I love everything about it!
"The origin of the crazy story is a Space odyssey. The masterpiece is a Taxi driver. The origin of reality-fantasy confusion movies is Rashomon. The masterpiece is Mulholland Drive. And this movie is too boring compared to them.
I'm a writer and I couldn't help to think where it was wrong ... I think the Joker was too passive. If you write a hero who only accidentally meets unhappiness or some unfortunate encounter, nobody follow your story. After all, the hero must make an effort like a hero. Even if the hero made much efforts but no effect because of the social twist, people will expect that he will go wrong if you got hint in advance that he has cut out for doing bad things. If he knew he has the gift but he hold it out by his conscience, but after all these events...if I were the writer I would have wrote like that."
"The first time I've come out of the cinema in a long time feeling satisfied, excited and amazed. Joaquin Phoenix carries the whole movie, with his portrayal of the joker being immersive and entertaining. Every aspect was amazing- great choice of songs, brilliant acting and beautiful cinematography. So impressed!"
"This movie or Shawshank Redemption takes the number 1 spot of my favorite movies. Seen it in thereaters twice. Masterpiece, well done Joaquin Phoenix, supreme acting. He must get an Oscar for this!I cannot wait for Joker 2.10/10"
"I haven't been this obsessed with a movie since I saw Taxi Driver 30 years ago...and my obsession for Joker surpasses it in spades. Everyone else has said all there is to say, I can't really add to it other than to say it almost feels pointless to go to the movies after seeing this because it's impossible for anything to compare. I can't explain why it's so good, you just have to see it. The directing, cinematography, music, screenplay, and of course the jaw dropping acting....everything about it is flawless. The timing of the film is uncomfortable, yes, but I think it's needed. Joker doesn't teach us to be violent. It teaches us to STOP BEING SUCH ***HOLES TO EACH OTHER.I understand that not everyone will connect with this film or ""get it"". And you're not supposed to. This is a film for those who relate to it in some way and not everyone will. But if you do, if you get it, you won't ever see a more remarkable and all consuming film. It's truly astonishing filmmaking.And if it doesn't sweep every category at the Oscars because of controversy then shame on the Academy and shame on everyone voting."
"First of all I will say it from the get go, go see this movie. There isn't a single thing missing. The direction, the cinematography, the acting, the scores and the feelings that this movie portrays all blend together perfectly to create the masterstroke that this movie is. Many critics keep complaining that ""there isn't a clear point"" that the movie tries to make and it confuses me. The society's marginalization of people with mental illnesses and the unjust economical inequalities are for me the crystal-clear points that this movie made. Cinematography at it's purest form. This movie is a gem like no other. 10/10."
"Guys just go and watch it in cinemas, this is a master-peace. I dont have any words to say, incredible work. Thank you."
"It's hard to believe someone doesn't understand the violence and the villain formation in this movie. The script doesn't try to make the idea of a redeemer violence it's a lunatic story, it touches in sensible points about human mind and our destructive behaviors. Transcendental, Joker is the truly villain, not just a purple guy snapping fingers."
"You finished a very great performance, I just want to say thank you Joaquin Phoenix!!!"
"Joker takes you on an emotional, disturbing yet a magnificent journey. Joaquin Phoenix puts on another brilliant show and the greatest character continues to live on as the favorite super villian."
"The one lesson I learnt from this movie is only if he had one person whom he could his friend, Joker would have had something going for him.
Be nice to people, you might be the only one for a person."
"If you just smile your life would be happier ....
this movie takes my mind and all in in my head are happy cause you mustn't give a damn about others when they make fun of you and say bad things to make you sad . Because that's life us the song of Sinatra's says some people get their kicks stomping on a dreamI don't say go kill others like joker but don't ignore bad behavior from others just strike back and have a smile !That's life gentlemen"
"Finally DC movie who come with DC's DNA since Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy, superb action from Phoenix and 'out of the box' plot, something that Marvel will struggle with...."
"I can't find words to describe Phoenix performance, just amazing! What a movie"
"As a lifelong fan of western comics, anime, TV sci-fi and cult & masterpiece movies, this film truly is a historical landmark of cinema. Kudos to Mr. Phoenix and Mr. Phillips, they have achieved something no one else had until now in the superhero genre, true art (Except maybe Nolan's and Ledger's Dark Knight).
Superhero-wise, this Joker has been brought to us under an entirely different light. He makes you feel sorry for him, mad at society for having forsaken such a hurt man. Appaled of how the system can abandon a sick and lonely person in the time of most need. Truly despicable are crowds of people who mock a man dressed as a clown with a smile, but who cries inside. A cruel, bitter and tasteless joke this is."
"Dark, twisted and amazingly disturbing. Arthur is such a complex character. This movie isn't just abou t him as a character but an example of how a mentally ill person lives and wants to be normal. I have a mental illness as well and I relate to Arthur perfectly, people have let me down, I've felt like my life was worth nothing. And we mentally ill people we just want to be noticed and understood, and that's what Arthur really wanted in his life, I perfectly relate to him. This film also tells us how bullying can affect the victim and what a cruel world this is. Otherwise, the film felt heavy and tragic. I watched it 2 days ago and it's still bugging in my head. Could definitely watch it again."
"Maybe it's not connected to the comics or it's source material, but for the love of god, THIS movie is everything i ever wanted for a movie about the infamous clown prince of crime.Joaquin's performance is beautiful, scary, depressing, and violent. From Phoenix' laugh, you can actually feel his sorrow, to be honest i feel sad everytime he laughed.Also a plus point for the cinematography and scoring, both score and visuals made a prefect blend.This movie diffuses illusion, dreams, and reality into one, so it's kinda hard to tell which is which.So it's a 10/10 from me."
"This movie is phenomenal. Joaquin Phoenix didn't just play the Joker, he became the joker and the slow burn story was not boring if anything it was the perfect rendition of how the Joker came to be. So realistic that you feel bad for Arthur Fleck and you just wanna give him a hug."
"Acting 10/10
Actors 10/10
Sound 8/10
Soundtrack 9/10
Dolby Atmos 6/10
Drama 9/10
Action 3/10
Suspense 9/10
Story 10/10Conclusion:
When you ever want to know why exist joker and batman you must see this film.Jaquin phoenix play his role very intense he play the feelings of the character authentic i never think about that the character is not real i look outside and i can find one normal person who can have the problems from the playing character. Joker is more than a dc story joker is the mirror of the society."
"This truly is Phoenix's magnum opus. Few films are able to have such strongly resonating and impactful displays of violence that over the span of the film, through such an emotionally developed character, creates an uneasy feeling of genuine consequence to each driving action that Arthur performs in the creation of his alter ego.Phoenix's performance is so unnervingly raw the viewer is left perplexed by the deep insight into the constantly decaying mind of the man behind the makeup. A pleasantly surprising dedication to a role prior known only to fans of the character as a chaotic evil."
"The whole movie, starting from the very first scene, connects to you deeply. It is a rare movie, I'd say, these kind of movies are made once in a century. It has all kinds of emotions, lows and highs, ups and downs, everything. The way they connect the story between Arthur Fleck (early Joker) & kid Bruce Wayne (Batman in future) made so much sense and had so much meaning to it. The script, story, screenplay, direction, everything in the movie was on point. The Music Director - Hildur Guðnadóttir completely nailed the BGM.I don't think we can find any fault in the movie, because there was not even one single actor who acted a bit off. Everything in this movie, was simply, perfect.Hence, Simply Brilliant."
Joaquin Phoenix What an actor I watch it more and more
I can tell Joaquin Phoenix doesn't looked like he is acting in the movie but he already dominates the role of the Joker himself and that is why he is an Oscar-Worthy. And actually the storyline is a little bit slow but it's very perfect.Great job!!
"This is an absolute must watch, it's a dark movie about the injustices of society"
"This film lives up to the hype. It was superbly crafted and I can smell the Oscar nominations already. I will also say it was probably one of the most psychologically disturbing films I've ever seen and I'm not in any hurry to see it again any time soon.
But do yourself a favour, see it on the big screen, it'll add to the intensity."
"Favorite movie of the century for me, joaquin phoenix's performance is fenomenal and is definitely one to remember."
"This movie is amazing. Great acting that is so good, it gets under your skin. The psychological aspects keep you wondering what you are watching as you come to realize who this person is and why they see the world that they do!"
"Awesome movie ever watched bgm, visuals, performances just woow... Joaquin phoenix lived on the screen the story hatts off to tod phillips,I think an oscar is waiting for the work"
"I have second thoughts before watching that movie. But after seeing that, absolutely amazing!
I'm sure Heath Ledger will give thumbs up in the sky!
And the actor should get an Oscar 100%!!
I recommend to watch you wont regret!"
"Dark, uncomfortable, thought provoking film. Gritty, dirty, well observed cinematography. A commentary on our times, broken systems, abuse, lack of care; be it societal, physical, mental or pastoral. Owes much to Taxi Driver and King of Comedy. Takes Heath Ledger's Joker deeper and darker. All in all a fitting origins (back story or prequel, whatever) tale or stand alone movie. Complaints about violence? Meh, I've seen more in a Avengers movie...at least it has context.
We genuinely feel for the Joker, is he a misunderstood hero, a figurehead for a anarchic uprising or a monster?
Or is he what our uncaring, unpleasant society has created....?
There's more humanity in this film than the whole of the Nolan Batman franchise.
Does he save the girl on the train with his maniacal laughter distracting the abusers, not able to bear seeing another human abused or can he just not help it?
As he descends deeper into madness, seeking solace in his delusions, finding release in violent acts, you still empathise with him and despise what society forced him to be.
Watch this, love the streetscapes, colour palette, edgy soundtrack and fine method acting from Joaquin Phoenix - Oscar? Oh I think so."
This is the best movie ever ! The Joker movie does touch on many psychological issues. In many of his words there is indeed the truth that lurks in this world
"One of the best films I have ever seen, I had to go and see it twice"
"Joker really is a movie you should think about watching before you actually do see it. It's twisted, demented and true to art imitating life. I squirmed many times due to how close to reality it was. Never expected a movie about a villain to be excruciatingly beautiful. It definitely isn't for everyone and that's fine. Joaquin Phoenix did Joker justice to the point where I was happy to how he came to be."
Wow. Just wow. This film has blown me away! An absolute must see... one of the best films I have ever seen! It just gets better and better. A true masterpiece.
"I often go to see superhero or villian movies. But today I went to see the joker thinking that was the typical movie with a sad villain with family problems and stuff like that, but no, I GOT AMAZED it was spectacular, the acting of Phoenix got me disturbed it was incredible worth an Oscar and the movie itself was unbelievable, I couldn't stare away from the screen , I never knew what was going to happened and it kept me nervous an exited. 10/10"
"The comparisons to Taxi Driver are more than accurate and reminds you of other loner-vigilante style noir movies (Drive), but make no mistake, this has it's own mystique. Other people have already (and will continue) to explain why this movie is already a timeless classic. The themes explored here are ubiquitous in decades of character study cinema, but it never feels dull in this movie, it feels like a mind-stimulating food-for-thought.This movie made me FEEL, it made it's presence FELT. There was palpable tension in the theater, we knew we were witnessing something truly grandiose, but restrained enough to not push the pretentious border. It's a shame that this movie might have a stigma around it due to hyperbolic hysteria by headline/attention-seeking critics because there are far more violent films out there than this, this just happened to call out society and make the creators of a psychopath feel culpable, the truth hurts. This movie tells the truth.Joaquin Phoenix is a master at playing the brooding/unhinged role.If you watch movies for the purpose of wanting something to leave an impression on you, this is your movie. It does that in spades, and is one that welcomes repeat viewing.My movie of the year for 2019. Don't think another will come close. The House That Jack Built was my movie of the year for 2018, so I guess you can say I have a certain taste :)"
"One of the greatest comic-book villain movies in years! This movie blew my mind away when I watched it and there was so much explaining necessary to actually figure out what the Joker's whole story is about in this movie! I even rewatched the movie to get an even better understanding to what's going on! What an amazing movie! But let's get to the aspects of the movie. The story is absolutely unique, being taken in a more realistic approach! He doesn't get dipped in acid and turn insane, instead its from real life factors that turn him insane! The joker already has a mental illness in the first place too and how the story sets off from there is truly shocking and disturbing! There is so much to this story to explain, even you can come up with many theories on joker's life! It's truly depressing but terrifying at the same time! Then the acting with the characters. Joaquin Phoenix did so good in playing the Joker that he deserves to win an Oscar for it! I would be shocked if he doesn't win an Oscar at all because his acting was spot on to disturb us and shock us! All the other actors/actresses that were left did great in their acting of their characters, with many giving a realistic reaction to the joker! Then the style of the movie. The movie did so well in not overusing dramatization and truly offered a great dark theme throughout the Joker movie! As much as I have to say, this movie is one of the greatest movies this year and its truly the greatest villain origin movie I've ever watched! Definite recommend for everyone to watch!"
"Wow ! I'll be honest that I did not expect this one to live up to the hype, but it did. We've been overdue on having a proper masterpiece film out there and this one delivers. A movie that causes you to think and still leaves you thinking about why those events happened in the film or even real life. Leaves you thinking about why it's important to know both sides of a situation - of course this is a lesson that the Batman lore has always had, hence the villains having interesting backstories. There's so much to take in with this film, did you ever expect that from a comic book movie ? Much less a DC film ?! Batman has always been (to me at least) the most interesting story in the comic book world, because the villains are as interesting (if not more) than the hero. So many film adaptations have been made, but this one finally does an outstanding job exploring the story's most complex character. Joaquin Phoenix deserves all the praise for his take on this character. He got the mannerisms, looks, and ticks of a mentally unstable person down to a T, it's so natural and not cheesily forced - the guy is phenomenal. Whether people like it or not, we needed this film. No matter if you're part of the overly sensitive brigade that censors everything or an online edgelord who mocked this film for critiquing sOciEty, you need to watch this film - there's a valuable lesson in it for both of you. This is one of the greatest films that has come out in this decade. Congrats to the whole team who made it possible, outstanding job !"
"No superpowers, buf still the best villain ever. Just best performance, outstanding. This movie shows another reason why We love the joker"
Just give Joaquin Phoenix he's Oscar and end the year
"Dark, gritty and raw, a spit and saw dust film that delivers a meaningful and compelling story, no CGI nonsense needed. Great character building, great production, they got the mood and character of Gotham spot on was bould and unapologetic which I really liked."
"Beautiful picture, tremendous story telling, enormous acting, and amazing directing. Everything about this film is perfect!"
"Remarkable movie, best thriller of all time. Scary to think people who really are crazy will watch."
"Resuming this movie: A guide do madness. The buildup is amazing, from a tender guy with a mind illness to Joker. Reminds a Nolan movie mixed with Scorsese, the atecipation was high and didn't disappoint. Great performance from Phoenix who surely deserves all the prizes he will get."
"Joker is awesome. The movie is more about Arthur Fleck dealing with mental illness rather than being Joker, but the movie is awesome! Amazing acting. This movie deserves an Oscar for its amazing performance. Joaquins acting was the best acting I've ever seen. This movie is 1000/10."
"Greetings from Lithuania.I will be honest - i did not expected ""Joker"" (2019) to be this amazing movie. I saw trailer, i liked it, then read that it is heavily influenced on ""Taxi Driver"" and ""King of Comedy"" and thought that its going to be at least an interesting and not by a numbers comic book movie. And i was right - its far from any comic book movie i have seen ever, except for ""Logan"" and ""Dark Knight"". Well, know there is a ""Joker"". What made those two films exceptional? Its that they went beyond and in different direction then you conventional PG13 comic book flicks from Marvel. ""Joker"" on the other hand is a great character study movie - first thing. If you would remove Gotham city and some characters from Batman universe, this film wouldn't even had anything to do with comic book movies. The other thing is that its just superbly done - this is hands down best movie Todd Phillips has ever made (and i loved first ""Hangover""). Cinematography was gorgeous and very stylish, music was haunting and editing was top notch - this film at its running time 2 h run like wind for me. Oh ye, and then there is the best performance of the year (so far) by Joaquin Phoenix - his Joker i think stands on the same ground with a legendary performance by Heath Ledger - its that amazing, and a bit even more complex because in Dark Knight Joker was a side character - in here he is a central figure, and what a great character that was.Overall, ""Joker"" is a great character study movie, and a very unique comic book film. Its different, for sure and make no mistake its great not because its different - its because the bold direction creators have went with it and delivered it full. This is one of the very best films this year so far."
"This Joker is darker than Dark Knight's Joker, The most miserable Joker than any other Joker, And most chaos Godam City ever. But it is most beautiful than any other Joker. Lastly, I can say, ""This Movie is Perfect"""
This movie is an absolute master piece. I have always related myself to the Joker and this movie mirrors how I feel on a day-to-day basis. This movie could not have been made any better. 10/10 Why s0 s3r10s? we really do live in a society.
"It's funny to see so many 10's, this Joker is not the Batman's Joker, but someone who inspired the criminal who will become the Batman's Joker.
This movie is more a drama and a portrait of today's society than a Super Heroes (Villain) movie... so, don't expect action.
The performance is good, but not superb. I think the movie is very overrated."
"I heard all the hype about this film and as a skeptic at heart I came into this film with the most critical mindset possible.I just finished watching it and I am absolutely speechless. I don't think a film such as this has ever been made in Hollywood before. The slow and steady fall of the Joker into complete insanity is just so realistic that you feel a strange empathy towards him and almost come to justify his actions even when he commits the most heinous crimes. This is what makes this film so incredible, it takes the ""villain/good guy"" type of film making and just flips it right on its head.The cinematography captures this perfectly, you never feel rushed into a scene and yet it keeps you glued to your seat (thanks also to the music and score which contour this film perfectly).Joaquin Phoenix gives the performance of the century and only thanks to his brilliance is this film even possible. I feel sorry for the actors who gave Oscar-worthy performances this year, as Mr. Phoenix's acting in this film is just from another planet and deserves all the accolades it can get."
"As a Batman franchise lover, I was exited to watch this movie due to the high ratings and over selling trailers. All I can say is that I personnaly cannot agree with statements that this is the best « Joker » ever. It's a psychological trailer, nothing more. I was expecting much more than a young Bruce Wayne vaguely appearing in this movie to bring me into Gotham City universe."
"Simply awesome.By no means a super hero or super villain type of movie. This chronicles one mans decent into insanity. It is grim, relentless, sad and utterly compelling. A damming indictment on how mental health issues are dealt with. Dismissed, mocked or simply ignored.In this story we are shown what happens when such an individual, finally, screams enough is enough. Down trotten, rejected by society and held up to endless ridicule, the Joker when he finally emerges is simply terrifying. His very public outing will go down in cinema history as it is memorising, disturbing and truly believable.There is talk of Oscars for this performance and it is absolutely merited, Joaquin Phoenix simply nailed this part. This is not a popcorn, switch off the brain and watch the action movie. It takes the viewer into the darkest, most distressing thing there is, our own mind.Brilliant movie."
"This movie was sensational.
The actors, the cinematography and most importantly the insight into mental illness and it's victims.
There is such a stigma towards mental illness and watching this movie really highlights some of the reasons that an individual may develop a mental illness, and how someone's childhood and upbringing can effect mental health throughout there entire life.
The joker had serious trauma throughout his childhood, and it came to surface in adult hood as you can see in the movie.
The build up of the movie from start to finish was very intense and overwhelming.
It highlights the stigma people can have towards mental illness and should be an eye opener for those who are too quick to judge people.
Sensational movie. I would recommend this to anybody. Huge thumbs up."
"I've never wrote a review, I regret every rating I've ever given a movie because of the tens I've put that pale in comparison to this masterpiece. What an amazing flick. Words can not describe the brilliance of Phoenix. Masterful. Mesmerizing."
I just watched the Joker and it was so powerfull and its one of the only movies that makes you think about our society and our actions. Its such a masterpiece. A true work of art.
Probably one of the best movies I have ever seen in a while. The one flaw it has was probably that it could of made the lines of what was a dream the whole time and what was reality smoother.
"Thinking to Joker it is a haunting, beautiful film that shines in it's brutality. Not in terms of the violence, but more along the lines of witnessing one man's journey into madness. Each event, each action provides a great amount of weight along with an unease factor.Joaquin Phoenix's performance was phenomenal and you can feel the heartbreak along with the mental strain that continously pushes him into a dark mind set.The grittier nature of Gotham, combined with the beautiful score really help sets the mood, and the songs from Frank Sinatra and Jimmy Durante adds whole another of class in midst of the slums. The Cinematography manages to catches the beauty, and the despair of a Gotham city that is falling apart, not too mention that the score and licensed songs help add another layer to the film."
"NO SPOILERSGreat movie. Tasteful references to 'The King of comedy'. Somewhat in line with the Batman story line. Cinematography, acting, story, character progression, comedic tones... All perfect.A good watch, highly recommended it. I don't know who is paying these critics to write such BS reviews. You're not original when you rate a good movie badly. We all know you are just doing it for attention/clicks/fame. Yours is a dying breed and the more pointless reviews you write the less we will care about you. Grow up."
"Saw the movie yesterday. Amazing. It's a captivating story and also tragic. Joaquin acting is superb, and so is the whole cast. I rarely want to see a movie tive um the cinema, but I think I will make an exception on this one."
"I'm just gonna say wait for the 2nd half.
Its a masterpiece."
"This was the first DC movie that I actually paid attention to and paid money to see. I did go into the cinema with high expectations after watching the teaser for the film. Already, Joaquin Phoenix had astonished me with his talent. It was within the first 10 minutes of the movie that had captured me.It is clear that writer, producer and director Todd Phillips should be credited for this as he kept the audience hooked from the beginning till the end.The way in which Arthur Fleck's life was portrayed was truly amazing storytelling and really took the audience to new lengths in explaining his real life story. Interestingly, Todd Phillips uses the struggling society and city of Gotham to reflect the physical and mental state of Arthur. In doing so, he explained contemporary anxieties and how society's actions impact our lives in terms of behaviour and how it makes us who we really are.From a young age, we are taught that there are heroes and villains. We are always told that the hero needs to defeat the villain and shouldn't be questioned because it is for the ""greater good"". However, we never really stopped to think why it is we have heroes and why we have villains in this world. Instead, we're immediately taught that villains correspond to being evil- that a villain should be punished by a hero. However, after watching the life story of Arthur fleck, is it actually correct to call him a ""villain""?Should someone who has been so badly treated by a toxic society be labelled as a villain? Isn't it true of nature for someone to cry when they are upset? To laugh when told a joke? Actions do have consequences. This is simply the same way it is for Arthur fleck to criticise his society for kicking him when he was down- for pushing him away when he wanted him- for refusing to put on a happy face when all he wanted to do was to be truly happy when society didn't let him.So yes, Arthur may have done some things that make him fall under the category of a ""villain"", but who is the true villain?- him or society?After continuously being beat down and trampled on by society, Arthur fleck began consultation where he would receive medication and ""support"" from a therapist. In this way, it could be said that the medication Arthur was given, may have made his condition worse eg: depression/ anxiety. Aside from this, Arthur had a therapist who would simply ""read lines from a script"" instead of listening and actually helping him. This is part of the major issue in society whereby the people who are vulnerable and needy are pushed away by those who have power, even if it is only a little bit. People like Arthur are neither seen, nor heard and the only time they will be - when they do something that goes against the ""rules of society"" because ""putting on a happy face"" doesn't work for everyone.As the film progresses, Arthur is taken off the very little support he will have been given and stripped from his job. With nothing left, Arthur began hallucinating and suffering from psychosis- believing that things were real when they actually weren't- developing negative thoughts. All he has is ""negative thoughts"".Moving onto the acting in this movie...Joaquin Phoenix as the lead role was a brilliant decision made by Todd Phillips and other casting directors. It is vital that that a role such as JOKER should be played correctly, without a single fault- especially after Heath ledger's Oscar winning performance. Joaquin was nothing short of excellent. Utter perfection. Not a single fault in his acting. From breaking out into laughter to playing an emotionally and mentally wrecked character- Phoenix mastered it all. An Oscar Win is essential and exactly what he deserves. Every moment, every word spoken and every frame that was shot was done to perfection.By Saniya Khan
Assisted by Khadijah SharifThank you to the cast and crew for a brilliant movie and conveying a strong message that needed to be seen and heard."
"This is not a normal superhero movie where you will expect glamorous CG. But it definitely gives you more thrill and excitement than the other superhero movie. A smile, a bully, a setback, a betray, a misunderstanding, a confusion, a lie, a chance, these are what life makes of. Anyone who gave out score lower than 9 repeatedly reported the lack of excitement from the movie, that's because you guys are lack of life experience to feel so."
"Very rarely now it seems does a movie even leave you feeling like it was a worthwhile investment of your time. More often now films are regurgitated storylines, reboots, or an attempt at something new that feels like it shouldn't have been done. Even more rare now is a movie that leaves an impact on you long after you see it. Joker is just that.Granted there is a lot of hype with this movie and an equal number of ""professional"" critics who clearly think it's cooler for them to say this is a terrible movie so that it makes them feel elite over the common moviegoers. With that said, this movie is absolutely perfect and how anyone cannot say that after seeing it clearly doesn't have what it takes to appreciate such raw talent of acting, writing, direction, cinematography, and music.The entire film feels so intentionally and intensely dark, awkward and real that it make you feel the sanity slipping from Arthur's grasp. Phoenix's acting challenges that of even Ledger's Joker and does so through mastering the smallest physical gestures and expressions that make the character feel more real than ever. From the way he runs, dances, stares and smiles it feels 100% authentically Joker.The movie does a great job incorporating elements of the Batman series that fans will enjoy but makes this a completely stand alone movie. For anyone worried that they might not get it because they don't follow Batman, no worries, you won't be disappointed. The storyline does a fantastic job of ""producing"" the Joker, giving him slow building reason behind the madness that feel authentic rather than corny. The incorporation of Pseudobulbar Affect disorder, and even the way it's initially presented and the character's ongoing struggle with it throughout, to explain for and add the maniacal laughter is genius. The childhood trama mixed with current personal and social issues with a desire to fit in makes for compelling reasons to believe this is happening rather than a supervillain being born from being picked on.The entire movie is dark. And that's an understatement. Like Requiem for a Dream level dark. And the story feels like Taxi Driver, V for Vendetta, and American Psycho crammed together inside a Dark Knight costume. All of this is done completely right in every aspect from lighting and angles, to interesting intermittent scenes to add more to the development of the story and character, to perfect camera angles, shots and editing, to intense and properly chosen music. I guess my only criticism is the casting of De Niro. Let's face it, he's not a good actor and we're all just kinda going along with him because he's ""one of the greats"". Earlier in his career and in some roles sure. But not now and not as a funny late night talk show host. But... it's not terrible and they make it work but better casting could have been done rather than relying on a big name.This movie is one that will go down for me as one of the best I've ever seen. I left the theater wanting to buy another ticket and go back in to make the experience last. Very few movies now make you feel something. Even fewer do it this well."
"This is one of those once in a lifetime movies that will make you move uncomfortably in your seat. You want to chear for him, you understand how he got to where he is, but your logic and morals don't let you connect. Truly a masterpiece, and fantastic acting. Life is cruel, people are cruel, and this movie slaps you in the face with it."
"Overall, the acting is the best part of the movie. Most of all Joaquin, but also Di Niro and the wonderful Frances Conroy (big fan).
However, several skills of the Joker were left out, f. e. top strategist or excellent chemist. What was left is a so-and-so comedian bordering on looser turning into a psychopath. And please, the cliche of bad childhood and the mother did him wrong, etc.... Worth a big Joker laugh.
I also missed the grand finale, maybe Arthur is using the raids to increase them, creating chaos, etc.
In the end it is a good movie about the Character development from looser to psycho. Not new, but well done and acted. For me it is just not the title character.I will be happy if Joaquin might get an Oscar or Frances as supporting actress, but can't see the movie deserving more awards.About the often in the media mentioned brutality... Well brutal behavior in a movie about a psychopath.... Wow... I am shocked... Who would have thought... *end sarcasm* 😂"
"I personally loved the movie, you have to go in with an open mind. I agree that you can't compare Heath's Joker to Joaquin's. They're both unique and spectacular in their own way"
"Joker is a film about a man's transformation from the mentally ill loner Arthur Fleck to the widely-known villain Joker. This seems straightforward enough, but there are much deeper messages in this movie that apply not just to this fictional universe, but to our real world.
Arthur is a man who has been beaten down by not just society but fate itself time and time again. He has been dealt, for lack of a better term, a s*** hand and no one in his life seems to truly want to help him. He is a man that truly is alone in society, learning throughout the film how true that statement really is.
While the actions committed by him are definitely wrong, we understand him and can even somewhat empathize with him (hopefully we can, I may just be weird). Unlike how some people like to suggest, this movie doesn't glorify the violence that Arthur causes. This movie shows how horrible people can be created by the environment they are living in. We are living in a time where we like to blame the violence around us on the insane people who start it. Shootings are happening more than ever, and the insane gunman is responsible for it.
Of course, it cannot be denied that the gunman is at fault. There is clearly something wrong with the people who do these things. However, much too few people think, ""Why is this happening?"", ""Why are these people doing the things they do, and how can we stop them from doing this?"" We see the result of what happens when an at risk individual doesn't get the help he needs in this movie. What we need is a system that can actually help these people.
The movie Joker differs from other comic book movies because it is not only grounded in reality, but it's messages can be directly applied to our world. People like Arthur Fleck, people who have been brutally beaten by life at every turn need a way to be helped. The rich and successful don't care about these people. These people are viewed as threats instead of who they really are: humans, just like everyone else. We need to create an outlet where these individuals can get the actual support they need, not stuff them with medication and let specialists with their own agendas pretend to care about them.
Another argument I've seen about this movie is that it has no reason for existing. It shows violence and shows a unique portrayal of a popular character but it has no substance to it. As you can probably tell, I strongly disagree with anyone who believes this, and I truly believe anyone who thinks this completely missed the point of the entire movie.
In conclusion, this movie definitely has substance and doesn't glorify violence in the slightest. This movie brings up an issue in our society that we have been neglecting for far too long. There's a stigma about mentally ill people that we have to get over. People who have been neglected and have nothing left to lose are the most dangerous type of people, and the problem with our society is that we allow people to feel as if they have nothing left to lose. Arthur Fleck is just a person who never got any sign at all that he was needed or loved by society, or anyone for that matter. He is truly, as cliche as this may sound, a product of his environment. You can criticize this movie for being too dark but by doing so you're just dismissing the reality we live in."
"Amazing Acting , plot , directing everything is perfect .
one of the best joker origin movie"
"Love how Phoenix express himself as Joker, absolutely will watch this movie again."
"I made an IMDb account just to write a review for this film and give it the 10 star rating it deserves. JP plays the role of Joker perfectly. Dark, disturbed, lonely, angry, he just nails every aspect and his performance in this film just has to be seen. He 100% has to win the best actor Oscar when awards season arrives. I was hooked from the very first scene and was enthralled throughout. What an outstanding piece of cinema. Amazing. The best film I have seen in a long, long time."
"Watching this film was fantastic, you were so immersed in it and everything that happend had some real impact, to some even, relatable problems. The music was fantastic, the atmosphere was good and the way Arthur tries to be positive and find solace and happiness, everything is only made worse by lies, no help, no friends no nothing.The reason for why for me it is a 10/10 is because i've been in a similar situation before, no friends, don't know how to get help or what to do. Sometimes these simple problems cause the worst of epidemics, ex: violence, mass shootings, suicides and so on.This movie is pretty much a fantastic depiction of mental illness and ""society"".
Watch it, it'll open your eyes to alot of things and topics you've never been able to grasp in its entirety."
Full of emotions and performance of actor is world class definitely Oscar getting movie
"An.outstanding performance from Joaquin Phoenix, serious masterpiece, a beautiful soundtrack, quality scenes. The best movie of the year and one of the bests of all time"
"Dazzling performance, every moment shown can be happening to so many of us. Nerve breaking acting. This movie will remain one of my favorite for ever. Everyone needs some importance in life. Thank you for making it so real."
"The feelings that this movie brings on you are really hard to describe, and it takes a while to swallow completely. Its dark and enters in morality and realistic topics, criticizing the way that society works, how most people see the mental illness and how an economic crisis can afect someone. Joker isn't a monster without feelings, he is a creation of a broken world, a broken Gotham City.
The most amazing part of the film is that they put you in the mind of Arthur Fleck, in a lot of scenes which there is a conflict between Humor, Tension and Fear. Out of nowhere you find yourself and others laughing at a terrible scene, just like the Joker would, and there is nothing you can do about it.
The development of the protagonist is well distributed and it works. His laughs which were once impulsive and uncontrolled turns into a coordenated and at the same time chaotic aspect of the personality of Arthur. I really think that Joaquin Phoenix did an excellent job and deserve at least an indication to the Oscars, being pessimistic.And answering the title of the review:
I tell you what you get, you get the best movie of comics ever made!"
Outstanding movie with a haunting performance and best character development ever seen
This is one of the best movies ever. What a great performance by Joaquin Phoenix (Oscar winner) Todd Philips is genius (Oscar winner). Everything about this movie is just perfect.
"Not only was this movie a masterpiece, but Joaquin Phoenix's acting is PHENOMENAL! Hands down the best movie on the year. Very dark and beautiful. Explosive and exciting."
It's a fantastic movie and deserve the Oscar prize
"It's the best movie I've seen, at least in the last decade. It's the easily conceivable story of a man who has been abandoned by the system that is supposed to protect us from people like him."
Great movie. It is is the mind of a person with a mental illness.
"Where do I start with this.... the storyline, the acting, it was just incredible. Hats off to Todd Philips, he made all of us viewers jokers as well, cuz whenever he would do something that isn't right, we would get happy and laugh with him. This is one of its kind!!"
Possibly the best comic book character depiction ever put into film. You feel the transition coming through every scene in the film and the wait is amazingly worth it when the joker finally arrives. The scene on the steps when he's become the joker was spine tingling because you realise this really is the Joker that your watching in the flesh. If this is the only version of Phoenix as the joker I'll have to accept it but if they can replicate this quality into a sequel it will be spectacular. What a film!
"I admit it. I did not expect much from this film. But my god It was a nice surprise! Positives is by far the transformation of joker from start of the film to the end. It's incredibly dark and probably too distressing for some people to watch. The violence happens now and then but each time makes a huge impact! The negatives are obvious the main one being of course the late heath ledger, he left quite a high bar to jump! I personally believe phoenix matches him and does jump that bar. People just need to realise this is a different actors approach and different take on a character from a different universe. The second negative is the one that got to me the most. I personally believe part of jokers charm is no one has a clue who he is where he's come from or how he got them scars. I did eventually accept the origin story of course and I ask other hardcore comic book fans to do the same. As once you pass this hurdle this does become one of the best films ever. I will be returning to the cinema to watch this again which Is a first for me."
"From the moment I watched the trailer I was intrigued by the portrayal of this Joker. I loved that they created a backstory for this villain, it made him human. Joaquin Phoenix was amazing, his performance throughout was astonishing, from contorting his body, to dancing, his glance very strong. I also loved the choice of his outfit (and colours) when dancing down the stairs, just perfect. The music, journal writings and silences were powerful. I cannot remember the last time I admired a movie this much."
"10/10 it is unfair for this movie because he deserve more
Special thanks for all the crew in the movie"
JP is so good that it hurts watching this stellar Performance. I grew up reading DC and Batman in particular... this movie leaves me speechless and this Joker Origin is just perfect. I will cry myself to sleep tonight...
"I have no words really? I went to the cinema to see it for the second time today, it's even better now. I mean honestly, how can a person nail such an iconic role that good? Joaquin Phoenix plays the Joker the we have always wanted. Don't get me wrong, Heath Ledger's acting will never be forgotten. BUT OH MY GOD!
Joaquin's performance is breathtaking! There's a little bit of everything in there. But one of the things that I love the most about his acting in this movie, is how he succeeds showing multiple feelings at once. You can see Arthur's sadness while he's laughing. YOU feel his broken heart.
The directors of this movie show you the life of a schizophrenic, lonely and a psychotic person. I think we all don't really know who's side were on, who are the good guys and who are the bad guys?"
"I would like to start this review by pointing out the fact that everything in this movie is just amazing, from the cast & crew members to the acting and to the story itself. Many people believed that this would just be another Marvel-like movie, but it was nothing like that. Todd did an excellent job in telling this character's story in such a unique way that it makes you want more. The way that he told the story of this worldwide known character is something amazing. The cinematography itself was simply astonishing. Troughout the movie there were some amazing shots that just took your breath away.
Joaquin's acting in this picture was just out of this world. The way that he portraied Joker's character was something to learn from. He put his whole heart in this particular role and you could easily see it while watching the movie. He made you fall in love with the character, although he is a villain. Even the dancing scenes took my breath away as he did such an amazing job in this area too. He truly deserves an Oscar for this outstanding performance.
I truly believe that this is one of the best character studies there ever were. It is one of those movies that make you want to see it again and again without getting bored of it. It makes you want more. Todd made such a good job by bringing awareness to mental health issues
to the world and although this movie has its range of bad reviews, it still makes you understand how the society truly works these days.
To conclude, this is and exceptional movie and i totally recommend it with all my heart. You will not regret it!"
"This is one of the movies that you watch and end up thinking about for a while after.
It's very rare that a movie makes you truly terrified and yet understanding of why this villain is the way he is.
The acting is absolutely incredible, hats off to Joaqin Phoenix for this legendary performance.
The soundtrack was haunting, eerie, and heavy. Hildur Guðnadóttir's choice of using cello as the main instrument allowed for a very dark and churning sound that perfectly captures the turmoil inside of Arthur. Bravo!
The cinematography is breathtaking, the visuals are stunning, and combined with the meticulous directing and attention to detail, the final product ends up being a true masterpiece."
"A well crafted film with a more realistic approach on the comic book villain joker. The movie takes everyone to the 80's environment with the amazing cinematography, costumes and set design. Joaquin Phoenix is the only actor who could perform this iteration of Joker to the perfection. The movie is great and will be a cult film because it took a realistic approach by showcasing who Arthur Fleck is, and what makes him to be the joker. There aren't many action scene which is a great choice and in the few fight scenes which the movie has depicts how vulnerable is Arthur. The Nolan's Trilogy was a huge success and loved among the fans till date because it had a similar approach by making a batman film in a more realistic and a believable tone by making him more vulnerable to punches, guns, knives, dogs[;)] instead of making him more pumped up with too many gadgets, armor and fighting against the unbelievably strong godlike villains with his infinite stamina, health and never ending supply of his gadgets. The more grounded approach made the audience feel connected with Nolan's Trilogy. This film also follows in those footsteps and had achieved it perfectly. Todd Phillips with his direction and Joaquin Phoenix with his acting, together they have crafted a masterpiece."
"People are already familiar with superhero movie genres (like MCU) - state-of-the-art special effects, top-notch action, eye-catching action, clear good and evil, usually divided into two lines of good and bad characters fight with each other. Joker appears as a new breeze, the film with dark colors, heavy psychology, multiple meanings. The film also has a villain, but it seems that besides Joker, all the remaining characters are villains, he alone with his desire, with his soul and body have been trampled to the extreme against whole ""world"". The majority of moviegoers are young people, including those who once loved the Joker of The Dark Knight. The Joker in TDK is much more crazy from thinking to acting out through action. He lives for his IDEAL, making Harley Quinn crazy with him. Joaquin's Joker is also crazy but crazy in a more life-like manner, with more psychological changes, making the audience think more. And so among the heads who have seen Endgame, there are some who have not felt the Joker, have not been familiar with such a heavy psychological drama after days of watching and waiting for the super products blockbusters, romance movies, live - action movies and horror movies. And although I disagree with Martin Scorsese's opinion that ""Marvel movies are not movies"", I understand he has his reasons for saying so. Please review Joker a few more times to feel the full meaning of the movie, I myself could not understand all the messages that the film sent, so I will definitely have to watch it again. I am waiting for analyzing and explaining the cut scenes in Vietnam. But please don't say that Joker is ""bored"", ""sleepy"", ""not as good as Joker in TDK"", ... something like that. Because it's not natural that Joker is so appreciated. 😉"
"In my opinion this movie is too disturbed.
The character of ""Joker"" is a sick person that loves to kill other people but that's not who Joker should be.
So in general, there are good parts in the movie but in total I'm disappointed by it!"
"Ive been lucky to live and witness both Heath's and Joaquin's performance and till now the feeling is still surreal.It started with a slow pace, detail by detail describing how Joker became. Story telling was superb as it covered every aspect of the film. In short every question was answered from the start till the finish.I tell you this movie is not made for all. It is very dark and it will leave a mark on you when you finished it watching. An instant classic for me!"
"What do you get when you cross a Perfect Actor and Excellent Director
I'll tell you what you get...
You get a Oscar worthy masterpiece!"
Joker is a disturbing look through the eyes and soul of a sad man who blames the world for his insanity. An emotional adventure that attach you in the chair all movie. Masterpiece of the decade and the performance of a lifetime by Joaquin Phoenix.
"Movie of the decade...
Phoenix nailed it....
Dark and greedy ....
Wanna watch again and again..."
"I don't often write reviews for movies, but this film is just incredible. Joaquin plays the role better than anyone ever has, or ever could. You really do put yourself in Joker's shoes, feeling so many different emotions throughout. Joker exceeded my expectations in ways I didn't think possible. 10/10 performance!"
Very graphic and disturbing but you won't lose focus for a second. Astonishing performance by Phoenix.
Best Movie I have ever seen in my whole life and I hope to get 4 OSCAR to the Joker movie.
"The Joker is basically a film about a man dealing with severe mental illness. You will watch him go about his daily life struggling to cope and deal with the world around him. You will see how his illness affects him, it's quite unsettling.The Joker is dark and depressing throughout. It's an Oscar winning performance by Joaquin phoenix.This film is about the Joker before he becomes the Joker. It's his struggle with mental illness while he is trying to find his place in the world and become the comic book character that takes on Gotham City. I don't think most people quite realise this before they go to see it."
Joaquin Phoenix is going to win the Oscar for best actor at the 2020 Academy Awards.
"Love it, not a waste of time at all. Love the story, the acting,... everything is great and i CANT LET MY EYES OUT OF IT."
"The story is fast paced and the cinematography looked great. No unnatural dialogue, no fabricated bland romance - just awesome acting and a fascinating story."
"Well done, very well acted, good direction, good soundtrack, all in this movie works and its very interesting. Bravooooooo"
"This is one of the best thing I've ever saw in my life, I went to the theater for 6 times to saw this movie .
Joaquin Phoenix Is THE BEST JOKER EVER!
Take the Oscar NOW"
"The film introduce us the idea of the joker and it can be inspire be everyone who have a mental issue not you should fall in a chemical tank to become the joker, it's all it need just a little push"
"I'm not a fan of DC in fact I Watched most of marvel's movies (Marvel fan) But this Movie is different, The building of Joker's character was magnificent their was alot of references for Batman I think U shouldn't watch the Joker if you didn't watch batman Dark Knight Trilogy or if u not familiar with batman/Bruce wane Story.
This Movie was one of the best movies I've ever seen."
"Amazing movie ! , the actor performance , the story , the music , everything!"
Heath Ledger would be in awe. Get to the cinema now. Like nothing I have ever seen. Pheniox has turned on a performance of a decade.
"I was super excited for this movie ever since I heard Joaquin Phoenix was playing the Joker, I was not disappointed. The best Joker portrayal to date in my opinion A++++"
"After 11 years, the legacy has been revived. Heath would be proud!"
"I'm in awe.. Absolute awe. I just have no words. Joaquin Phoenix was born to play the Joker. The cinematography, soundtrack, acting, sets.. Everything was just pure cinema brilliance.This movie is truly worthy of a sequel and it would be an absolute shame if Phoenix never played the part again."
"Truly a masterpiece of filmmaking. I would without a doubt argue that Joaquin Phoenix holds one of the best performances of all time, this may even be the best performance I've ever witnessed in cinema. Truly truly a masterwork. People say it's violent but the world is violent, just most people who can afford to go to the movies are lucky enough that their bubble keeps the darker parts of the world out, but how long can we stay at such peace? Is the peace we hold real in the grand scheme of things? Or are we just fooling ourselves?"
"Since 20 years am alive on this planet but to be true I have never seen any movie like this. This is a type of movie which comes once in every 50 years, it's a pure art depiction of how a mentally ill person lives and finds it's true self. For those who don't know this movie is not taken from the comics nor it is related to the Justice League universe. This is a fresh take on the Joker character."
"One of the best movies I've seen my entire time , already watched twice and going for a third time next week"
"I have just returned home from watching the Joker without reading any reviews or listening to comments prior too, what I have watched tonight is a cinematic triumph, I could go on to use all the usual clichés but I won't, I actually commented to my wife as we drove home claiming we have just watched a modern day classic, a film so well crafted visually that it is actually faultless, from style to gritty disturbing focuses on character creation to beautiful cinematography that leaves you both moved and uncomfortable but so glad you watched it in opening week. This film will be the topic of many a discussion for years to come Joaquin Phoenix is mesmerising and equally the most disturbed Joker I have watched. Hoorah at last for something that's truly changed my opinion on modern film choices. But a huge congrats to those brave enough to endeavour in rebelling in film making in a world gone politically mad."
"I must admit I was hesitant to see Joker on my own. I didn't know how I'd react to it knowing the film has sensitive material about mental illness. I braved it out anyway; I left the cinema shook!The film was a raw and honest depiction of what a person with mental illness goes through. The line that hit home is one written in Arthur's journal: ""The worst part of having a mental illness is people expect you to behave as if you don't.""The film shows how society do not provide the resources for people with mental illnesses which make them turn into baddies. In reality, most would rather turn against themselves than to others. The film almost comments on how society fails to nurture people with mental illnesses.Suffering from depression myself, I understand what Arthur is going through. That does not make his actions justified though. He is no hero; he is a confused man denied the care he badly needs.I am lucky compared to Arthur, fortunate than most for getting the treatment I needed. I always had the support of friends, colleagues and family. Arthur isn't that fortunate which led him to spiral down to a bloody life of crime.Joker is a brilliant film you would want to see from start to finish. Credit both for a superb acting from Joaquin Phoenix and a genuine and powerful story!"
"It's not possible to say everything about this masterpiec. but i can say this and insure you that It's not only the time in the theatre you spend, you will keep thinking about this movie after you walks out even for a very long time."
"'Joker' is raw, real. It does not seek to impress but it does, and in what way. Todd Phillips manages to give a new air to the genre of superheroes, and Joaquin Phoenix is sublime in his performance... Not only does he understand the complicated character but he makes it his own. Something very dificult considering the iconic performances of Jack Nicholson and Heath Ledger."
"Personally I was not ready for the intensity and the realistic nature of Jokers mental health. This version of Joker stands on its own and should not be compared to DC or Marvel. It's a Drama. I have never had a ""Comic Book"" movie give way to all the emotions I felt, questioning every part of humanity and how we treat each other makes a difference. I applaud this movie for asking hard questions. Joaquin Phoenix was fantastic. It's a 10 stars in my book."
"This movie was just absolutely stunning. I would recommend this movie to about anyone. Regardless of controversy, this movie is as good as it gets!"
"I was so excited for this movie ever since it was announced. And today I finally watched it. I travelled around 100 kms just to watch this movie. Because I just don't want to miss this one. And ofcourse I loved the movie. It's once in a lifetime movie. It is Dark, disturbing, intense. Yet undeniably a masterpiece. Joaquin Phoenix without any doubt is a real gem of the cinema. This one is not for people who like typical commercial movies and who don't like dark, intense and violent theme.
Robert de Niro's role was short but he did a great job as expected. The movie keeps getting dark. I loved the pace, direction & cinematography. And the BGM is just fantabulous. From the moment when he puts a smile on his face with blood shows that Arthur Fleck is dead now and The Clown Prince of Crime is born. From that moment, He is no longer just a shadow, he's the light of those people to stand up against the oppressors of Gotham. Truly, I feel so overwhelmed by watching this movie. Loved it."
I just love the way he acts the way he cries he is better than any joker
"I've just got back from the cinema and I'm still in complete shock how incredible this film is. The acting from Joaquin moved me in parts and felt uncomfortable but incredibly gripping at the same time, just amazing. I've never felt this way from any of the previous related films, but this one is very different. You truly feel empathy for Arthur even though he has none himself and this film not only helps to put the whole backstory into perspective in a way that's never been imagined before, but also truly unique and intense while retaining moments of dark humour even in some of the most depraved scenes. Absolute masterpiece!"
"Joaquin Phoenix is utterly phenomenal portraying the birth of Gotham's greatest villain, the Joker.
This is a story of man slowly losing faith in humanity to the point of madness. We get to know the Joker first as Arthur Fleck; a sad loner who isn't well liked because he makes people uncomfortable. He doesn't have friends, or a special someone in his life, only his mother who he still lives with and cares for. Arthur does the best that he can, working hard as a party clown but he is down on his luck and the world he lives in is brutal. On top of that his dream of becoming a comedian is shattered when talk show host Murray Franklin shows a clip of Arthur bombing at a comedy club. Meanwhile tension in Gotham has been mounting as the poor have been suffering and they turn their anger towards the rich, who seem completely indifferent to the struggles of those living in poverty. It's the perfect recipe for disaster and chaos.
This haunting tale is definitely a must-see!"
"Joaquin Phoenix gives a tour de force performance, fearless and stunning in its emotional depth and physicality. It's impossible to talk about this without referencing Heath Ledger's Oscar-winning performance from The Dark Knight, widely considered the definitive live-action portrayal of the Joker, so let's talk about it. The fact is, everyone is going to be stunned by what Phoenix accomplishes, because it's what many thought impossible - a portrayal that matches and potentially exceeds that of The Dark Knight's Clown Prince of Crime"
"You will feel the joker alternation of his metal condition, when you watch moive"
"I will start with the obvious... There is NO comparison with EndGame... Different movies, different styles of cinematography..
The whole thing is just a mirroring to the society at the current time.
Those who have power & money stomp over the ""weak"" but cant see what these ""weak"" are capable of.....
The scene in the train with the 3 bullies is just WONDERFUL...
For the main character, I think that Phoenix goes it to another level. NIckolson was a caricature, Ledger was a maniac, but here we have all the aspects of the Clown Prince of Crime gathered.... Isanity, Paranoia, Pain, Suffering, of course Vengeance and cold blooded reactions...
In the 120 mins there is such a progression in Joker as a person & character, min by min, scene by scene...
Beautiful direction & photography.
There is no discussion for the Oscar of 1st male actor. If the movie is for 10/10, JP is for 12/10."
"What an amazing interpretation by Phoenix!
Also the plot is brilliant. Well done!"
"The fact that the film has the best giggle so classic of Joker's hysterical laugh makes this film deserving of an Oscar. It certainly is a masterpiece, far outperforming Dark Knight and actually deserving a place beside Taxi Driver."
"In my opinion Joker is a flawless movie. The dedicated way Joaquin Phoenix portrays the character is so unique you just have to appreciate it. The character development throughout the movie is some of the best I've ever seen and the cinematography was absolutely stunning. I was hooked for the 2 hours the movie lasted. I think if you appreciate movies as a form of art you must think this is one of the best movies out there, if you're just looking for a superhero movie to watch then you probably won't like it that much."
"Probably the best, most compelling movie I've seen in a long time. Joaquin Phoenix is a LEGEND!!!"
It's been a long time since Hollywood has put out a good film. This one will make you explore feelings you didn't want to and feel good about it. The story with Phoenix performance is historical. Every aspect of this was perfect. I can't believe how great this movie is.
"Now that the Joker has had a couple of legitimate outings, I think it's clear to say that Joker may be that best outing. I know that Heath Ledger is known to have the best performance, but wow does Phoenix deserve an Oscar. His character goes through such a terrifying and disturbing character arc that you don't want to see, yet can't look away. All the performances are sensational (including a couple of twists) and a brilliant ending to wrap everything together. The score matches it clearly, taking that ""Joker"" persona very clearly. I can't think of anybody that can match what this character may be. If Phoenix wins an Oscar, then this means that the Joker is one of the most complex and interesting character ever in film. All in all, Joker makes the viewer believe that everything he does is okay (but it's clearly not) and keeps you on the edge of your seat through brilliant direction and a sensational character study."
"Phoenix gives an absolutely phenomenal performance as the joker, in my opinion the best that has ever been put to screen. The story goes places you would never expect it to and plays around with the Batman/Gotham city lore/characters in interesting ways.My only slight problem is that I think it takes a little too much inspiration from taxi driver, and that a certain character feels wasted or unimportant but they're not in it for that much anyway"
"One of the most incredible performances I've ever seen in the theater. This acting, the brilliant shots, haunting score, ...this movie deserves every award."
"The title of my review is how I imagine the joker would want me to feel.
I want to smile as the directing and acting is flawless. You believe every scene and quite frankly you would be an a****** to try and pick holes in it.
The crying is how at the centre of it, Arthur actually has a good heart, but was screwed over by society, work and family. What you're left with is the result of someone who looks at life with a glass half full coming to the relation that life is actually a glass half empty."
"Not a huge Phoenix fan, or Phillips fan.. but wow did they ever work hard on this! Phoenix stands alone and takes this film in as his baby. The acting / cinematography / violence / character development / setting.. all perfect!We don't deserve this film11/10"
Masterpice this movie...i want to this movie one more
"I though I was going to be unimpressed with this movie honestly, 'cause I had really high expectations, but I wasn't, it really is a great movie.
Joaquin's performance was truly AMAZING, give the guy some awards people, he deserves it."
"***_NO_SPOILERS_***
Finally a DC movie savagely walked n sat on the Masterpiece Shelve beside ""Dark Knight trilogy"". First I thought, It would have been great if Martin Scorsese directed this film when it was announced long back, but #Todd_phillips proved he is a master in carving this Art-Emotional-Crime-SuperVillain-Drama , a little slow.. but not for me , So Deep, Dark & Psychological tale for the origin of The JOKER , Todd Phillips's previous Comedy-dramas have gave him so much experience & insight to deal this psychic comedian, and he used it perfectly.Cinematography, lighting, Set works, Editing have perfectly delivered us Retro style of Gotham city.Joaquin Phoenix is the best JOKER till date as same as Heath ledger. But if I must say who is the 1st best... it's ""Phoenix"" of course for me, hands down !! Because he showed us shades of sanity to Insanity . A full length character study throughout the duration of the film.Robert De Niro , what to say about him ? , Top notch performance as Murray.that vintage stage-dramatic music is so engaging & apt to every scene accordingly.-Over all it is one of the greatest comic based films .
Phoenix deserves best actor academy award.#NOTE : This film is not like other DC/Marvel comics based films , not even a bit, far less popcorn entertainer than ""dark Knight trilogy""... No money heists, no major chase sequences, no blasts & shootouts , no big action sequences, ...It's something like the this decade's Taxi driver (1976), The King of comedy (1982) & Man on the moon (1999). If you are only into that above entertainer kinda stuff & doesn't like little slow art type films, then better stay away from this ."
"My two cents: The message is that people can be as disturbed as can be, but the only thing that will lead them to the light is kindness. Let's see what happens if a person gets the oppossite.Wrapped in a great movie with the greatest actor of our time."
"I was on board for this movie since day one. When the first trailer came out I was shocked by how you could see the the care and detail in every shot of the movie. And, Phoenix's performance looked insane. After the final trailer I was sure this movie was going to become best movie of 2019. And, when I finally coud watch, all my expectations were fulfilled. From start to end this movie just cannot stop. You will laugh, you will get shocked, you will even cry. This is the best character study I have seen since Taxi Driver. Simply, magnificent. And that ending, well..."
"This will be a short review, so I adored this movie it was a masterpiece and sends a strong message you will have to watch it to find out."
"Just came home from the cinema. My five cents: It's basically taxi driver 2 with a Joaquin phoenix overplaying pretty much every scene. I thought it was entertaining and beautifully shot, but not my favourite movie of the year. And come on, that ending with him at the show admitting killing those three guys without anyone doing anything. That was a bit too much."
It doesn't follow story at all and casting was terrible Joker would be 80 or dead before he even fights Batman and he looks like some crazy clown.
"Horribly shallow, derivative and repugnant. Dramatically flawed - actually the story of the mother told through the excruciatingly telescoped lens of the son. In the process it vilifies just about everyone (but no points for consistency because if they'd had the guts, a struggle with sexuality might have actually made it interesting {I can't help thinking the thought was on Joaquin's mind but the film declared otherwise}). One of the profound master strokes of Ledger's portrayal was to specifically preclude the need of an origin story yet like so many the need to have that incredible manifestation explained willed me to my seat for the whole acrid, eat-all-your-stinky-seventies-references-or-there's-no-dessert duration. What is eventually slopped out in response to the riddle of the joker (I promise to take that no further) however is so remarkably banal that it better serves to illuminate the gluttonous, exploitative villainy of the corporations behind the production. That said, production values were decent although I couldn't help comparing the dim cinematography to the exquisitely stark visions of the Nolan movies."
"This movie blew me away. I was very hyped and excited for it, but I kept myself distant from the trailers and clips. Joaquin Phoenix is a now certified LEGENDARY actor!!! Jesus he was amazing in this movie, and delivers probably the greatest solo acting performance since heath ledger in the dark knight. I will admit the movie was a bit slow but I was easy to forgive since this is a character study kind of movie and it does say a lot about society. I won't go into deep specifics in this review but you'll know when you see it. I thought the cinematography was stunning of a run down Gotham City, the score was thrilling and mesmerizing. I can't get it out of my head, I just simply can't. I highly highly recommend this movie if you favor great acting and if you want your mind to be blown. Thank you for your time."
Very nice in my opinion it is the best story about the joker
"I feel like a lot of movies that get hyped up are somewhat overrated. I didn't feel that way with the Joker. It exceeded my expectations. First of all what a decision to turn a comic book character into a serious drama. Turning a cartoonish villain into a vulnerable human. It's very creative and honestly for me this was the best movie of the year. You got so many comic book spinoffs that I have no interest in but this isn't even about a comic book it's a very human story.Joker is very dark. So dark that I won't watch it again in the near future. That means it did the job as it was meant to be a punch to the guts. Of course Joaquin Phoenix was excellent in this movie. His acting was phenomenal. He was able to make you feel so many different emotions. The screenplay was also excellent. It's a very human story that feel realistic.Joker is simply a masterpiece. Well-written, well-directed and well-acted. It's the best movie of the year and it's certainly a cult classic that will remain the topic of discussion for decades."
"Outstanding performance by Phoenix, amazing character development... one of the best movies I have seen in a while..."
"K this was an incredible work of art, not gonna beat around the bush. Jauquin pheonix is giving a career highlight here, it might be even better than his performance in the master but I'll have to think about that. Tod philips and cinematographer Laurence shaper have made a beautifully shot movie, and the shot length really gives pheonix and De Niro room to act. The camera work itself is also very well done, but its not the type off camera work that calls attention to itself like that of Paul Thomas Anderson or Martin Scorsese. The blending of reality and fantasy and reality is also extremely well handled, I'm not gonna give spoilers but I will say that its kind of like American psycho and middle school:the worst years of my life (does anybody's remember that book?). It is important to mention that this movie is not for everyone, it is violent and intense, but that being said its not as violent as other art house movies like drive or hereditary. No, its not really the violence as much as the intensity and the emotion that the film evokes, which is most certainly not a complaint its a great aspect of the film. Cinifix's 10 most emotional movie moments has 2 slots in it that focus on second hand embarrassment or cringe and deep uncofortable-ness and I'd say about 87 percent of the film are squarely in those 2 spaces. Overall this movie in its own special way is a masterpiece, even if its not at all easy to watch."
"Great acting, awesome atmosphere, fantastic music and an all great round film. I've never reviewed a film before but I found this film to excel my expectations despite taking a different direction to what I was expecting."
Abit of a slow start but loved every minute. Can't wait for a second!
"Very heavy movie. Looked in one breath.I am a reviewer, but I can't find the words. Simple, high quality, hard, smart. Becoming a villain from a harmless person. Society is to blame. Always.Watch everyone!"
"""Joker"" is without a doubt the greatest film I've ever seen, (and I've seen my fair share) thats not overstating it one bit on my part, the sheer impact this film had on me was overwhelming, and the absolute and genuine empathy I had for Arthur Fleck is heart felt, and the dark subject matter it deals with is true to our times, I was fully engrossed with him and in his corner throughout, I instantly knew I had just watched a masterpiece, from the very beginning to the very end of this film it has you totally and utterly encapsulated and fully absorbed, i urge everyone to see Joker you'll be watching the art of movie making! a Joker sequel could work or it could just be a stand alone film it really is that versatile 10/10 I would give it 100/10 if I could. 👌🏻🤡👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻"
"Take the next ingredients :
The King of ComedyRequiem for a DreamThe Dark KnightTaxi DriverMix all of these and then ladys and gentlemans we have : Joker ."
"Oscar winning performance from Phoenix, the film gets into the fabric of the Jokers madness, and his intelligence. Great cinematography and scene formation. Great supporting sound track. Sorry to the haters, but this is up there. Enjoy!"
"Saw it yesterday and it is still replaying in my head. Loved every minute of it.
The acting was phenomenal. In some scene Joaquin was conveying several emotions at the same time with total surrender and believability. I was just in awe to see a human do this. That's acting on master level. At the same time you saw this very fragile looking human being a victim of his illness and environment and on the other this incredibly strong will (insanity ?) shining through. The cinematography was just amazing. I was drawn into this dark depressing environment but with such a visual clarity and details. I almost forgot the music. There was this cello music emphasizing dark insanity coming out drawing you further into the scenes. And during the action scenes some very fitting songs were started in perfect synchrony. Great.
One of the best movies I have ever seen. A real masterpiece."
"It was pretty clear from before the movie got released that despite being a central comic book villain, Joker would not be anywhere along the lines of any superhero/super villain film we've ever seen. Instead of having the clown of Gotham going on a mad rampage to burn down the city, we witness an origin story for Joker : a story of how a normal if not slightly delusional person on being bogged down by society can turn into an uncontrollable, cold-blooded madman that we all know of.Joker's alter ego Arthur Fleck's struggles makes it immensely relatable and it is amazing to watch the character develop throughout the film. Joaquin Phoenix never fails, delivering a strong performance and proving that he is one of the best, most devoted method actors in the industry.Joker rides on a simple plot fueled by a cast of extraordinary actors and a spine-chilling soundtrack which goes perfect with the protagonist's actions. With a couple of gory scenes, the movie can feel a bit heavy to handle. The movie, with beautiful cinematography ,successfully captures the essence Prince Clown of Gotham!"
"An origin's tale which does justice to one of the most iconic villains in cinematic history. A breathtaking performance by Phoenix brings a new perspective to the audience's perception of the Joker's enigmatic persona.Led by Todd Phillips' sharp direction, the film portrays the tale on a very dark canvas in the backdrop of a Gotham city in hopeless turmoil. The film is punctuated by a negative vibe throughout, courtesy of the dark tones, the filthy alleyways, graffiti-filled walls of Gotham city and Fleck's sombre mindset.Phillips is able to carefully thread through the scenes to show the birth and evolution of this ""mentally-ill loner"" who is knocked down time and again by the city's fragile societal structure as well as discoveries about his disturbed past. In the process, he gives us a powerful insight into his mind and how it breaks down beyond repair, probably epitomised by the moment when he murders his own beloved mother.A mind-boggling watch overall, which is excruciatingly painful yet beautiful at the same time, with the laughter ""condition"" acting as a perfect foil to this legendary character."
This is the movie that makes you unsatisfied. Unsatisfied because you don't wanna stop the screen presence of Joaquin till the end of the movie... and even after.. Masterpiece 😎
"Seriously, I'm just going to cut all the way through the BS. I love movies, I have always loved movies. I know what's good and what's bad. You need to go see this right now. Movies like this rarely come along, maybe once or twice in a lifetime, go see it."
"I was highly sceptical at first regarding how the movie will turn out to be, going by the plot, I had no doubts about Joaquin, one of the best actors of his generation.
I am so unbelievably impressed by his acting, Todd's direction, the sound, the score, cinematography, the 80s vibe. Its been YEARS I've seen such a great movie with great everything in it. I can understand why some of the critics dislike this movie while they like similar or even more hardcore movies compared to this, one of the main reason has to go to the realistic feel of this movie, i have never seen acting like that ever before. The movie is so realistic and it tackles real life issues that ought to make anyone uncomfortable but in a positive way, i do not think this movie has the potential to incite gun violence etc(please, john wick anyone?), those are just rubbish. And lastly, we can not compare Heath and Joaquin's Joker, they are a class of their own."
You do not leave the same person after seeing the Joker.
My only issue with the movie is the lack of this line
"The film is one of the most beautiful films that I have seen for the actor, the great Jokaine Phoenix. The sequence of events and the soundtrack is fantastic"
"But, my new favorite movie ever. Its an absolute must-watch. I made an account just to make this review."
"The character development in this film is amazing. Reflecting on the person you saw at the beginning of the film and at the end are so totally incomparable. Heath Ledger set a high bar, and this film was a fantastic and different take on a story. It was totally gripping - one of those films you talk about for 2 hours solidly after seeing."
"Pure art, pure masterpiece. Unconventional brilliance, you have to see it and feel it.
I'm left speechless ..
Thank you!"
"Now this is why i keep going forward in life because of films like this masterpiece with a true message and by far Phoenixe's best role, some great acting and him and ledger are good in their own way.Definitely a well made jokers origins story, i couldn't ask for it better, everything about it, the cast, picture, action and the plot were fantastic and definitely sets up Christopher Nolans magnificent Batman franchises."
"This movie is a masterpiece. If you ever were bullied or have had depressions and felt like everybody is against you, you will feel with the joker through the whole movie.
This movie is unsettling from the get go and gets only worse from there on (but in a good way:)). As we witness how the character - Arthur Fleck, who will become the joker - is gradually sinking into insanity, caused by the selfish and cold world he lives in and by his own psyche.
The role of the Joker is delivered brilliantly by Joaquine Phoenix, who in my opinion, deserves an oscar for it.But beware!
Its a movie unlike other superhero movies. This one is more of a character study of the joker, why he became who he is. I would sort it into the Genre of Drama/Thriller."
"Pros are obviously Joaquin is amazing and the direction is competent and it's beautiful and I actually liked a lot of the changes they've made Bc it's an origins story. Cinematography= excellent. I love the grittiness, the swearing, the constant chain smoking, the blood, the scene in the apt when he murders the guy with the knife and lets the little man go was great, the girlfriend thing being all in his head was great, joaquins dancing was great....Cons= a lot of the writing was just lazy. He got away from murder way too easily (literally nobody was in the subway tunnel= needlessly convenient) the murders of 3 random punk kids starting a crazy movement of violence was unbelievable and stupid (they weren't important at all just 3 rich kids with no explanation?) although I liked the idea of Thomas Wayne being a bad guy pretty much every scene with him was stupid (the joker sneaks into the theatre so easily during the protests=stupid) the end where he gets murdered in the alley during the violence was really stupid and so lazy (the guy was running for mayor and had no body guards or anything= totally forced the Batman connection). I liked the themes but they were way too overt, like when he basically rants on tv about his mental illness before shooting Robert deniro... totally not like the joker at all... I don't care if it's supposed to be like that.. it could have been a lot more subtle and natural but wasn't... and finally, although it was gritty and dark... I feel like they were still way too careful and preachy... like I was expecting him to kill a lot more people and honestly hoping for it because that's what the joker does especially for his origin story! Everyone is obsessing over it and saying it's amazing but I really just think that it fell short on Way too many levels. Worth the watch and definitely more bold than most but could've been great and simply isn't."
"Peter Bradshaw of the Guardian has got be the worst film critic on the planet!
How did he ever get a job doing this.
He is clueless.
Ignore his review .
This is a brilliant piece of film making"
At loss of words. Legacy of Heath has continued finally someone picked up where he left. Wow what a performance. I can still hear the laugh.
"This film is definitely a masterpiece. This is probably the most realistic film I've seen since The Dark Knight. The color grading, the soundtracks, the costumes, and overall EVERYTHING is phenomenal. Truly an Oscar Worthy performance by Joaquin Phoenix, Robert De Niro, and others. This film mainly depicts on mental illness, rich vs poor, and what would happen to a person if society doesn't treat him/her well. NO JOKE YOU SHOULD WATCH THIS FILM!!!"
"After the credits started rolling I sat in my chair thinking is this real? Did they really make such a movie? Are they even capable of making movies like this? This is easily the best movie I have watched in God knows how many years. Oh, and Joaquin Phoenix deserves an Oscar"
"I just saw the movie for the second time, and i'm gonna go watch it for the third time and even a fourth time.This movie is amazing, everything in this movie is incredible. It really deserves an oscar."
"As someone who isn't that big of a fan of the DCEU thanks to the quality of the films being kind of wonky (a few are great, a few are just okay, a few are really bad), I wasn't expecting that much here, considering that this film, besides having the Joker, has nothing to even do with the DCEU. Plus, as great as Joaquin Phoenix is as an actor, he was never exactly the first guy to come to mind when thinking of who to play the demented clown himself. So, you can imagine my shock and amazement after coming out of the movie theater, because, oh my god, this film is incredible. It takes everything you thought you knew about the Joker and not only flips it on its head, but expands upon it tenfold. The way this film portrays what Arthur is going through and how he evolves into the Joker is some of the best character development I have ever seen in a film. This film has a perfect balance of making you sympathize with the main character, while also making you mindful of the terrible acts he has done. It can feel a bit disturbing to almost side with someone who's obviously dangerous, but the way this film manages that is genius. All of this is helped by two things. Smart and excellent writing, as well as the performance. The story is great. It's well paced, thought provoking, smart, poignant, and constantly almost eye opening. Joaquin Phoenix was pretty much perfect. His performance is Oscar worthy here, as he really did become the main character. When Arthur laughed because of his condition, I really felt the pain behind it. Seeing how his life is and how he lives it really seemed real, and that's what helped me sympathize with him, even though, again, he's dangerous. If all of that wasn't enough, everything else about this movie is great too. The direction from Todd Phillips really shines, as the way this film is structured and put together helps the film not only flow really well, but to be delightfully dark and twisted. The performances from everyone else were all great too. Robert De Niro was phenomenal as Murray Franklin, as he was very committed, which helped him really turn into the talk show host from this film. The same thing can be said for everyone else, whether it be Frances Conroy as Arthur's mother or Zazie Beetz as his love interest. Everyone did great, as well as Todd Phillips for making such an incredible film that delves into the mind of the demented clown while making it extremely heartfelt. I also loved how they linked the Wayne family to the story. I won't say what happened to avoid spoilers, but that really helped this feel like a true part of Batman's past, all of which happened in a movie where the caped crusader isn't even around yet (I hope, because a Batman film after this would be awesome in my opinion). Overall, this film is amazing, and I recommend anyone who hasn't seen it to do so, because it not only has fan service aplenty to longtime fans of the Joker, but it also has everything that makes a great movie great so that it can be enjoyed by anyone. One last thing to note is that there is a lot, and I mean a LOT of gore in this film, so if you're squeamish about that, then I'd probably wait until I'm ready to see it. I say watch this with an open mind, and what you'll experience is a thought provoking masterpiece that tells a story you never thought hard about and tells it damn near perfectly."
"The first half was boring the second was a bit better. The actor did a good job, however overall average movie. Nothing special."
Joaquin phoenix should get an Oscar for this.movie is outstanding.
It was a privilege to experience this film. Joaquin Phoenix exceeds expectations in every aspect. Director Todd Phillips does an amazing job of delivering such an exhilarating character piece even given the film's contrast to those that he has directed in the past. Joker speaks an unspoken truth about the human condition and is an absolute must-watch.
"This movie was absolutely amazing in every way. I'm so glad they finally displayed mental illness in the correct way and although he was/ is the bad guy, it also sheds light on what causes someone like him to snap. I would watch it over and over again. The actor deserves an Oscar. He was awesome."
"If you walked out of this, give it a few... Frozen 2 will be out soon enough."
"I have to admit that I had a certain fear to this film.
The first thing I'm a big DC fan, the Joker is my favorite DC villain, and to make a movie about him without Batman, somehow illogical and unimaginable.
Second, the director is Todd Phillips who has now done only comedies (admittedly good and really good) such as Hangover, Due Date and Road Trip. I knew that Joaquin will be great as he has already proven and rewarded an actor with several great roles, but history has taught me that it's no guarantee because the last Joker was catastrophic and the actor is also a great actor (Jared Leto has an Oscar).I was so wrong.The film is perfect, crafty and brutal.
Most of all it tells me that even after three days of looking at it, I still think about him, about acting, about scenes, about music, about a possible message.
As expected, Joaquin was singled out by the big screen overall. Each scene is his own, he ate the part and ordered the desert afterwards. He brutally gave himself into it, physically and mentally. Honestly, it will be a bigger surprise if he doesn't win an Oscar, but it doesn't even matter given the award history. He showed so many emotions and layers of one fictional character on a larger level, leaning to the floor!
Any comparisons to Ledger are unnecessary, they both did the job to the highest possible level, each with their own version that fits the film. Both are perfect.
I did mind the two minor things in the movie, however they turned it around to fit the story so I have no qualms.
I really like that this can't be called some kind of superhero movie that we've been bombarded with for years, it's a pure psychological drama. It reminded me a lot of the tone and atmosphere of Taxi Driver, even in some scenes one can see the impact and similarities in Martin Scorsese's film. It was as if it was shot in the 1970s which was Hollywood's prime golden age.Honestly, the reactions of film critics, ranging from disappointment to excellent, were not clear to me. In the last few years, you may have 5 films for which you will become a cult classic in the future. The Joker is definitely one of them.Purely subjective and well deserved ten!"
"Finally we get a Joker who is not Batman-centered, a Joker who walks his own path and tells his own story. Thank you!
This is the best 2019 movie to hit theaters and it will stay in the minds everyone who watched for a long time whether you liked or disliked it.
It's not a movie for the critics' praise, rather than a medical diagnosis of our time. Should you fail to notice the message Joker brings, you might as well surround yourself with happy thoughts and watch a Disney movie."
"I never write reviews for any movie. This movie made me write it, Well Joaquin Sir..Take a bow.
What a superb acting. We start with having sympathy with the character and end up supporting him.
Somehow we don't feel that whatever he does is wrong. It feels justified.
Crisp direction and amazing background music.It's a must watch. Go and see it today."
"I've heard a handful of people say this is a bad film
That's there opinion fair enough
Joachim Phoenix is amazing in this to the point I think he is a better joker than Heath Ledger which is a bold statement as I loved Heath as the joker
Phoenix takes this role and runs with itI could watch over and over"
"Joker was not only a fantastic story that was filled with emotion and intensity, it also portrayed mental illness as something that should be taken care of in the real world. When you watch Joker he does all these crazy things in the movie but the story isn't necessarily telling us to forgive him for his acts but more or less understanding him for what he did.The story was so well put with emotion and heart breaking agony for the main character and joker made it seem as if he couldn't take it anymore. Phoenix took his acting to a whole other level for this film and him and this film definitely deserves an Oscar"
"By far the film of the year, Joaquin Phoenix morphs from Arthur to Joker seamlessly, and it isn't rushed, it just slowly unravels into chaos stunningly.
Range of emotions, from shock, amazement & sorrow.
A sad plight, perfectly executed."
"Even days after watching this I literally cannot get Joker out of my head. It's one of the best films I have seen in years. It's dark, menacing, chaotic & yet beautiful. Joaquin's portrayal of Joker is simply mesmerising. His performance was chilling yet moved me to tears, just so inspiring."
He really deserves an Oscar for Best Actor. Astonishing performance. I am so feel in his deep character. And I am sure that this film will sweep Oscars next year. This film is Super Contender for Oscar ! 10/10 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
8.5/10. Incredible acting by Joker. Should win best actor easily. Directing is also Oscar worthy. All in all an incredible film which can be watched several times with different interpretations. Will probably go see it again soon and the rating could go up from a 8.5 to a 9 once I wrap my head around it all. A well done film.
Oscar worthy! Amazing mental twisted! One of my all time favorites!
"I have waited this movie since Todd Phillip's announcement of this movie. Great Story, Great Acting, Great Score. JOKER deserve an Oscar Nomination. Joaquin Phoenix deserve An Oscar for his performance."
"I went to the greatest movies I have ever seen in my 54 year life. Joker is not a villain. I gave it 10 stars, to the Oscar people it deserves at least 10 of those.
Phoenix will receive an Oscar for sure."
One in a lifetime movie! The plot will have you on the edge of your seat. Joaquin Phoenix deserve an Oscar for his role as the joker. Todd Phillips could have not wrote or directed a better script .
Not a single point in this movie will dissapoint anyone . As we know that joker in dark knight has set huge mark on peoples heart . This movie had not let its progress down . The most satasfying movie and really good thinking from director about how jokers life will be in his days . Brillant work
"This is just my opinion but I loved the Joker, the performances, cinematography, directing, style, all build a great story. And the acting from Phoenix was incredible, he done a great take for the iconic character, and wow does he commit, with loosing the weight for the role, to developing the laugh."
"#Joker is intense, bold, disturbing, and surprisingly poignant at times. Joaquin Phoenix gives a stunning performance that's equally as disturbing as it is emotionally layered. Oscar-worthy in every way. Beautiful cinematography and an incredible score by Hildur Guðnadóttir."
"First of all, dont expects that you will get an action movie cause this film isn't an action movie. The experience this movie will give is unpredictable, the music, the cinematography, the character development, the storytelling, all of of this things looks solid. This movie deserve oscar. 10/10"
"Best Movie Ever Made. The Acting, The Direction, The feels.
This is DC."
My favourite film of 2019. Beautiful acting from Phoenix and something i'll be thinking about for days!
"Just came back from a screen of this & was blown away by how good it was! I knew it be great anyway, but from actually seeing it, I'm convinced!The film tells the backstory of how the Joker became who he was & what his personal life was like before he snapped & became a cold blood murdering villain!I found the film to be fully engaging! It was dark, blood, brutal & visually stunning! The actors done great jobs & preformed very well by giving convincing portrayals!I'm starting to like the trend in the DC Universe where these 15+ versions are showing us the raw & truly gritty side of these villains/heroes you never get to see in these watered down 12+ versions!Overall an epic, brutal & raw story about the Joker!Go & see this! 10/10"
"Someone pass me an adjective. Listen to no haters or outragers. Go see it right now!!!! Thank you for making this masterpiece. I hope everyone involved in making this film is proud. They deserve all praise. Just WOW. I spent half the movie with my jaw dropped literally. My faith in good cinema is returning. Knock Knock, I want more"
What a movie im still shaked best actor for joker what a master piece!!! Loved it
"Not a single Comicbook movie excited me until this one and that's because of Joaquin and Joaquin only. This character is tailor made for someone like him who has given terrific and criminally underrated performances over the years in films like The Master, Walk The Line, Two Lovers and Inherent Vice. Todd Philips made the right decision to a character study psychological film rather than the usual adventure/action.Gotham City is like NYC in 1970s/80s a city with massive wealth inequality, rising crime and brutal austerity measures. In surroundings like this, a fragile and broken individual like Arthur Fleck is bound to explode but how he does and why he does is what we see for 121 minutes. The undertones on anarchy, capitalism and classism is quite brilliant and this is one of the films where we cheer for the guy we are supposed to dislike.Joaquin Phoenix not only does justice to Heath Ledger in this film but creates an own legacy for himself. It's a shame that a guy who has given better performances in movies like The Master and Walk The Line will probably win his much awaited Oscar for this role, a highly popular character to get noticed."
"I understand why some people don't like the message that this movie tries to convey... but come on, we can't ignore Joaquin Phoenix's epic performance and Todd Philips' one of a kind directing. I literally can't say anything negative about this film. Just Fantastic. I would give it a 100 out of 10 if that was an option!"
"Words don't do justice to describe the amazing script, dialogues, story and superb acting in this movie. I am not going to bore your or steal the thunder of the movie with a long review, but let me tell you so far what you know through the teasers and trailers is simply the tip of the iceberg. There is a bigger arch and captivating story in this movie. I just watched the movie, and I am definitely going to watch it at least couple of more times before it is taken off the big screens."
The cinematic piece of art tells a unique and beautifully rethought origin story of the iconic villain Joker. Joaquin Phoenix's performance is captivating; everything from the way he dances to the way he forces smiles upon his face in the movie. The work of art integrates the stigma around mental health in our society today while dramatically showing how mistreated Arthur Fleck was by the fictional society in which he lives. Who would've thought that such a movie could be so moving? This film is special... the type that doesn't come around very often. It deserves endless credit and is 100% worth the watch.
"My husband and I went to see this film and found it extremely depressing. Moreover, everything is caricatured. What could be more normal, you might say, given that it was a depicting the life of a comic book clown?
Christopher Nolan, the director of the famous Batman trilogy, said before it was produced that this movie would be useless. Simply because when it comes to horror, the less you show, the scarier it is. If you're told that there is a giant monster in the woods and it eats people, you'll laugh and not believe it or you'll imagine the most horrible monster there is; the most horrible according to you! What others show us is never as horrible for us as what we imagine.
Here, to make things really awful, we sink into the worst possible melodrama. As if psychopaths had all been mistreated during their childhood, mocked in adolescence, misunderstood in adulthood without ever having anyone to help them effectively! But no, the vast majority of them were born with a missing bolt in their heads. Something was wrong in them from the start.
Here, the director wanted to make us cry by portraying roughly the most cartoonish misery. Everything is in bold capital letters, underlined and highlighted to be sure that we fully understood that the main character didn't have an easy life and that our society is so rotten that we should all revolt and suicide out of desperation or kill each other to put an end to it all.
In terms of the actor's performance, that's Joaquim Phoenix pushed to the extreme all over. In all his films I remember, this actor plays social misfits, loners unable to make friends, depressive people or on the verge of a nervous breakdown, misunderstood guys, sons rejected by their fathers, rebels, etc. In short, he only plays tortured souls. He even played a guy who falls in love with his computer because he can't get along with a real girlfriend. So it's normal that he knows how to play a crazy clown. Talent? If you will, considering the fact that he seems unable to play much else.
This simplistic and gloomy depiction of society has already claimed victims. There are people who dress up as clowns and ransack everything in the streets and cinemas where the film is shown. It seems that some misfits wanted to believe that, as with the Joker, their misfortune depended on everything and everyone else. Their happiness couldn't certainly be up to themselves.
Anyway, don't believe the good things that are said about this movie. And if you feel a bit out of sorts, don't go to see it, you'll make yourself more unhappy for a film that's really not worth it."
"Very Good Good Good
this did deserve higher than Oscar"
"I went to see this movie a couple of weeks ago expecting a decent movie. However, after I came out of the theater I was shocked at the level of dedication needed to play the Joker. Joaquin Phoenix had to lose a ton of weight until he was basically skin and bone and play a convincing slide into insanity. His acting is so amazing that you forget that you are even watching a movie at all, and it is so mesmerizing to watch his new take on the Joker. This movie was engaging all the way through and had a perfect ending to match. What a fantastic movie."
"This movie was AMAZINGLY beautiful. I'm sorry for the people that dumbed this down to a ""social commentary""! They must have the emotional depth of a mud puddle. It shines a light on the darkness of untreated mental illness as well as cultural anarchy and instability. This was SO much more than an ""origin story"". It truly shows the inner demons and struggles that many have with social norms and the forced chaoticness of everyone's internal struggles with their own personal truths.This movie is not for stupid people."
Probably the best movie Iv ever watched. Iv seen all the jokers but this one deserve the oscar.
"I've gotta say that I was hesitant when a new Joker movie was announced. DCEU movies have so far been hit or miss (I'm lookin at you mr. leto). When I heard the dude from the Hangover series was going to direct it, my emotions were confused. I couldn't help think who could possibly fill the big shoes left behind by the late great Heath Ledger?A filthy analysis
~Joaquin Phoenix transforms into a malnourished, misunderstood loner who suffers from involuntary laughter and a truly pitiful life in general. Arthur Fleck's lanky figure, wicked dance moves and brooding facial expressions accurately overtly reflect the mental roller-coaster this man undergoes everyday.
~Thing is, no one around him seems to care. His delusional mother clings to her suspicious past and is seemingly unaware of Arthur's deteriorating condition. His boss at work and his supposed friends treat him like a joke(r). Hell, he's even getting beat up by children that stole his spinning sign. Is this commentary on bullying and mental health stigma in the current sociopolitical landscape? The media warned of disenfranchised teens becoming inspired by the movie to carry out acts of terror. Is this kind of fear rationalized and if so, if the mental health crisis has really reached a tipping point where a movie can become frighteningly real, what's stopping the Joker from becoming a reality?
~Now his condition was somewhat explained in the movie but it exists in real life as Involuntary Emotional Expression Disorder, and is often caused by traumatic brain injury. We see this type of injury is common in those suffering from pathological It's revealed that Arthur was physically abused by his mother's boyfriend, which could potentially be the determining factor in birth of Joker?
~The driver of this transformation from Arthur to Joker is the discontinuation of his prescriptions and his visitation to a social worker. His delusions of grandeur on Murray's stage are amplified to the point where his fantasies include a relationship with the beautiful Zazie Beetz. I know Arthur, me too man.
~The film includes shots of Arthur banging his head against the wall of his cell, crawling into his refrigerator, and institutionalized in a mental facility. ""All I have are bad thoughts"" he says as he recounts his origin story in his mind. The film ends with his time in the facility, and blood on his shoes. It's heavily implied that he killed his therapist, which directly contradicts Arthur's own record of targeting those who've wronged him (at least loosely). Can we rely on Arthur Fleck to accurately recount the details of his origins, when we aren't sure what he considers injustice? Can we assess a character's traits and moral values if we don't even know who he truly is?The cinematography of the film accurately reflects the psychological burden that Arthur Fleck endures. The bleak, poverty-stricken landscape of Gotham from Arthur's perspective is different from what we're used to, a billionaires perspective. The film utilizes call-backs and jarring transitions to build and feel the tension Arthur's feeling his life is in a downward spiral.And finally the acting, while everyone across the board brought strong performances to the table, the most gripping performance is by none other than Joaquin Phoenix. This man singlehandedly brought seat-gripping tension with just his facial expressions and jaw-dropping climactic conclusions (deaths) to many, many unfortunate characters. The academy would be absolutely bonkers if he does not get nominated.Every now and then there's a film that changes the landscape of cinema, while also reminding me of why I love to watch movies. The Joker proves that high budget, CGI-infested blockbusters isn't the only formula for a successful movie. The deep social commentary from the perspective of a mentally ill patient is a fresh breath of air from how it's normally portrayed in media. It would be easy for us to dismiss a character like Arthur as pathological serial killer, and no one would blame you for that. Each of us at the individual level contain a little bit of the pain that Joker carries around, and a whole lot more compassion to offer others in their time of need.Go watch this movie and give someone a hug and tell them you love them, 10/10."
"One of the best films I've seen. Joaquin Phoenix should get an Oscar for his portrayal of Arthur Fleck. The unraveling of a person suffering from mental illness was tough to watch in some scenes but I never felt his behaviour wasn't justified. I left the cinema feeling sorry for a man who'd always felt different and had been treated badly from a young age. JP didn't just throw himself into the role , he became Arthur. Not as violent as I was expected either so I don't reslly understand the controversy when it was released."
"The anticipation that I felt walking into this movie is very rare. I can only compare it to the same feeling of walking into a Christopher Nolan movie or Avengers endgame. It's an incredibly high bar of expectation and there was a thick atmosphere of excitement in the theater. I found this movie to be a masterpiece of film-making with an incredible lead performance. It covers the full spectrum. Wonderful storytelling and emotional beats, mixed with powerful dialogue and beautiful cinematography. The movie doesn't shy away from violence, and there is even some humorous moments of levity among the chaos and madness. I can't say enough about Joaquin Phoenix. He's a very special talent. The subtlety of his abilities are a joy to behold. He's a master of his craft. There are many standout moments in this movie and it tackles many very real issues - such as mental health awareness and social isolation. Highly recommended."
"Incredible, believable depiction of not only mental illness but of a man who can be seen as a legitimate human being in the real world. Unlike Heath (RIP), this Joker is less of a ""performance"" and more of a legitimate depiction of the real mental illness GOOD people face. He reconstructs what ""good"" truly is and, in contrast, the powers that be define what ""good"" is for their own advantage.Rant/related to movie content:
The wealthy make laws to ***k all the other people they deem inferior or unwealthy, and a lot of us really are ***ked by the likes of these elitist egotistical devils.Anyways, enough of that. Watch the movie."
"If you are someone, who is a bit more sensitive and is scared of violent movies, this movie will touch you.If you are someone, who expects a lot of action and does not bother with violence, this movie can be disappointing.To me it feels that this movie was more about getting a message about nowadays society sent to everyone and also about getting a performance of a lifetime for Joaquin Phoenix than actually about the story itself or Joker.I enjoyed it but expected more. When the movie ended, this is where I actually wanted for the movie to begin as it seemed like the actual beginning of Joker!"
Maybe the best movie in about 20 years or so. I was just blown away.
"This movie is depressing, brilliant and so real it's uncomfortable to watch. That being said, Joaquin Phoenix delivers the best acting I have ever seen and this movie delivers a very realistic look at how the unfortunate, mentally ill, weak and awkward live as well as how they are treated. By the end of this movie, I found myself actually cheering for The Joker fueled by the compassion and sorrow I had for his hardships and the lack of support he sustained from a society that not only failed him but made it clear that no one really cares. It leaves you with the realization that yep, this is the world we live in, the real world, where the rich and privileged rule. I wanted The Joker to make his official appearance and cause an uprising of people who are so sick of being ignored and treated like dirt that they find a hero from a crazy, violent, broken man. This movie does not hold back, it comes at you full force and stirs emotions that are confusing. We're not supposed to cheer for the villain. But then, who is actually the villain?"
"I can't believe that avengers as a better rating, that people cried and clapped at the end of avengers, full blown standing ovation, i was ready to get up at the end l
Of joker and clap as hard as i could, i knew it, i was sure about it, it was the best movie of the years maybe even the decade, but no, i was the only one with my brother and one other guy who got up and clapped at how good the movie, but nobody else...Joker is a dark and slow drama/thriller about a man living in a bad and difficult place, this place is called Gotham, you already know this place by heart as a fan, am I right?No, the joker will surprise you on every point, the soundtrack, the twist, the performance of Joaquin Phoenix. Everything makes sense and is really well put and done in this film. You are not only following a terrible man who wants to destroy the world, no, you are following the growing hatred of a man who has tried everything to be happy but will never be.It's a masterpiece that people will be talking about for years and oh my God, please. This film needs a better audience rating than the other shameless, useless and senseless disgusting things called avengers."
"Best DC/Marvel movie by a mile! Best Dark movie ever! Phoenix's performance as good as I've ever seen! If he doesn't win the Oscar then the Oscars are a Joke (pun intended)! OK, some parts are predictable but who cares! Too good to miss. Takes Dark to a whole new blacker level! A must see Masterpiece!!"
"That movie got me like no other has ever had. I couldn't even breath at some parts. What a great actor, what a great story. The movie was only started for 10 minutes and I was already like ""WHAT A GREAT ACTOR"". I've missed movies like this. You can't get distracted by anything while watching this movie, is just amazing. Have no words. What a movie... INCREDIBLE! Give that man an Oscar, please!!!!"
"This. Was. Simply. BRILLIANT! Everything seemed so well thought out, so remarkably executed and so on... Would love to go and see this movie once again for sure."
"Hauntingly Brilliant , a hard watch at times as Athur struggles through a torturous life.
The Brilliant soundtrack and Dark tone of the film which all DC films should have makes it easily slot in as a prequel to Christopher Nolan .. The Dark Knight
Time line would be out or would it ? Depending how you explain the ending"
"Firstly, Joaquin Phoenix as Joker is undisputedly going to win an Academy award for his performance. The way this film deals with the central character and the plot is brilliant. It may seem to glamorize mental illness or gun violence but this is a Joker origin story, Batman's nemesis and we see his story unfold with his very own eyes and the movie succeeds to do so.You can feel the pain he goes through trying to survive in this cruel and dark world and what laughing at wrong things can do to a person. We're not supposed to sympathize with such a person but you can't help feel sorry for what he's been through and what goes in his mind. There are really tense moments in the film along with moments of relief and solace.The people of Gotham were already fed up with the elite and rich. The way things turn out by the end of the movie reminds me of Heath Ledger's Joker line 'I'm an agent of chaos' and that's certainly what happened. He aggravated the people, introduced anarchy and total chaos. Being very authentic to the character of Joker.The score is just perfect, it tries to capture the loneliness when a mentally-ill person gets thrown away by society and the descent that follows later. The visuals, lighting and cinematography couldn't be more well suited for the theme of the movie. It feels kind of liberating what a person can achieve and disrupt the persistent nature of individuals, make them see true their colors no longer held accountable by society or the rules and go haywire. This movie as a Joker origin story is nothing less than flawless and phenomenal."
"What a movie?!
I loved every second of this movie. Not only it explains Joker it really restarts Batman.
Joaquin Phoenix deserves an Oscar and the movie as well! Music too."
This is my first time ever writing s comment and this definitely worths a 10. The story is told in a such a contradictory way that can be so touching at the same time.
"Joker (2019) tells a story about an unbalanced comedian named Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) being disregarded by society. He goes upon a path of self-discovery, in which his mental condition gets worse as the movie progresses.On the same note, the movie's plot was inspired by both Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy. That being said, the movie still manages to find its unique tone without completely copying one of the movie's narrative.Joaquin Phoenix delivers a oscar-worthy performance. His performance was jaw-dropping - no joke! He went through an extraordinary transformation throughout the entire course of the movie. You really feel sympathy for this guy, and you want him to achieve his goal. That's how good Joaquin is.This movie is, without a doubt, a piece of art. Whether it's the cinematography, the soundtrack or the cast themselves, they all deliver on it flawlessly.That being said, this movie is absolutely not for the faint of heart. It contains graphic violence, language, and it can be sometimes pretty depressing. It touches upon various subjects that you don't usually see in a standard Hollywood movie nowadays. Such as: anxiety depression and society itself etc. To some, it can be a problem. Therefore, I wouldn't recommend it for those kinds of people.Verdict: despite its controversy it gained in the past few weeks, Joker proves that there's so much more you can do with a standard comic book movie rather than watching it and forgetting about it afterwards. On the contrary, it approaches the viewers, and it makes them ask questions and think about the movie's existence, and what it has to say. I want to see more movies being made like this. Honestly, I was kind of sick of superhero movies, up until I saw this one. It gave me hope. It shows that there's more you can do with this medium."
"A masterpiece in character acting, Joaquin is stunning."
Best film i watched it was very good and nice so I recommend you to go watch it as fast as you can😂🌚
"What I loved the most about this film is how solid can stand for itself. This is an independed story for the joker and it's spectacular to finally have an origin for the character. Truly this is a raw film with some certain background meaning about the reality of society & mental illness. Of course the performance of Joaquin Phoenix is pure & the movie is very well done.. it has its flaws (I didn't like the face makeup that much, but it's ok, not complaining & didn't agree about a clown being the murderer of Bruce's parents, I mean, it changes a bit of the things) but anyways, this is a must watch movie!"
"Bursting with emotion. This film has won me over and dug me out of a ditch of cheap CGI fan fare.Absolutely outstanding. Really well filmed. It's pace, tone and character impressions really pay off. Most of the time you like your sat on the edge of Joaquin's feelings.Joker is a classic. And a cinema masterpiece. It was beautifully filmed."
"Cinematography was top notch, personally i love the tones on every scenes, the details, the camera movement, the backdrops, mostly everything visual about this movie, i love.Joaquin Phoenix did an amazing job performing his role, that's for sure. But comparing it with Heath's Joker, was unacceptable. Both did amazingly great job, both presented the role best on its own way, there's no way to decide which one is larger.Overall, i agree that this movie is not for everyone. And i personally, enjoy this movie truly as an art. True arts can be both sad and happy, ugly and beautiful, understood and confusing, love and hate, all those mix feelings at the same time.So, how do you take your arts, it's totally up to you. Cheers."
"""Joker"" is not a comic-book movie. It's a gritty, psychological thriller that delves into the mind of one lonely man, who is subject to the cruelties and neglect of society, and finally dissolves into a path of insanity that leaves him irredeemable. It's unsettling and so grounded in reality that while it does take some inspiration from ""Killing Joke"", Todd Phillips generates an original story that ultimately reinvents the character of the Joker.That being said, a comparison to Heath Ledger's Joker is just not applicable. Firstly, it's an origin story so that immediately removes the aura of mystery Ledger's Joker. The Joker in ""The Dark Knight"" is just a being of unknown origin, present to wreck havoc and be the perfect antithesis to what Batman stands for. ""Joker"" is about a lonely man named Arthur Fleck who gradually descends to into a being of madness who happens to be called the ""Joker"". He's not really the Joker from the comics. Perhaps that's because it's an origin story so that some of his most defining characteristics like his charm and genius-intellect are not fully-fleshed out yet. I totally respect the decision to totally reinvent the Joker, but I missed those aspects of the character, and ultimately, I'm hesitant to call Arthur Fleck the Joker.Despite the radically different character, Joaquin Phoenix slays his portrayal of this man. This movie is a showcase of his performance and cements the fact that the Joker is probably, if not already, the most coveted comic-book character to be portrayed in cinema. There are side characters portrayed by Robert DeNiro, Zazie Beetz, etc. However, this is Phoenix's show and his performance was brilliant, haunting, disturbing and moving. His interpretation of the Joker laugh is so nuanced, that it's more than just a trademark of a character. You can see and hear the pain, sadness, anger from his laughs as he ponders whether his life is a tragedy or comedy. He brought new dimensions to the Joker character, leading us at one point to empathize with him, his sorrow, and we watch helplessly as his character just falls into a path of no return.The script is well-polished and I appreciate that it takes its time and opts for a slow pace to ensure that Arthur Fleck's transition is natural, not forced and abrupt. The result is a dark brooding thriller which I feel can be segmented into two parts; the first of which depicts the crumbling of the wall between Arthur Fleck and insanity, followed by the latter half where things get unsettling and ramps up to accommodate Arthur's full transformation. Some scenes are disturbing, but that's what you'd expect to see in a movie that aims to delve into the mind of someone like the Joker. I do feel the main story arc is a bit too predictable, particularly in the second half of the movie. There's not a lot of impactful twists. That said, the score by Hildur Guðnadóttir is brilliant, as it compliments the dark atmosphere of the movie very well, with its sorrowful melodies and haunting background. It is music you don't want to listen to alone.All in all, ""Joker"" is a really good movie, and a very brave one too, bringing in topics that are relevant today. It brings to light the subjects of mental illness, and social neglect of those affected by the former. I'm not sure if it's really trying to make a statement about it, whether it's trying to say that anyone, if pushed enough, can be someone like the Joker. That would sort of take the ""special"" out of the Joker's character. It's definitely not the typical comic-book movie and the Joker here is not the Joker you typically know. But it is a very good psychological character study of a man crumbling to madness, powered by the brilliant performance of Joaquin Phoenix."
"Yeah, they did turn the archetype of arch enemy into the anti hero but I was expecting that in a solo movie.
I'm sure everyone has had that moment when the world pushes them too far and you wanted to push back as hard as you felt they pushed you, but instead of doing that you go and watch the movie Joker. especially with others who understand how your feel.
Joaquin Phoenix was brilliant in this film. Too bad with all the controversy he won't win an Oscar form it. It's the perfect academy award winning movie too, Phoenix as the Joker out shines he movie but unlike other Oscar contenders this year like Judy, The movie shines pretty brightly on it's own.
Loved the connection between the Joker and his greatest enemy that could have went badly but it worked out well.
It's a slow movie but I found Phoenix humorous. Not a violent as I though more like a lot intent for violence then small quick burst of it. I understand how this movie could be looked at as a bad stigma for the mentally ill, but for me, the flick easily told a tale of frustration and anger for anyone who knows what it truly feels like to be pushed around. It's good that he does not randomly target anyone, Anyone that get hurt by the joker is someone who (he felt) hurt him. It's the perfect origin of a supervillain. Overall it's worth it to see that transformation."
"This movie is slow but never makes you feel bored. The story is narrated in a wonderful manner. This movie sets a good example for others comic based movies that how can a negative character can be portrayed in such a manner that you though know joker in not a good man but will be feeling bad for him at some point.
The acting done by Joaquin Phoenix who played the role of joker was amazing. He was flawless and did proper justice with the character of joker which very few actors were able to do. Joaquin Phoenix is a brilliant method actor.
This is a movie made to see in movie theatre not at tv or any streaming app."
"Despite an extraordinary performance from Phoenix, the film itself is a sub-par experience. It's Taxi Driver lite, from someone who has seen the far superior film and completely failed to grasp its meaning."
"Possibly the worst thing I've ever seen , everybody else in the cinema thought that too"
"With some real good facial muscle exercises and some new condition display ...when disappointed starts un controllable laughs ... The screenplay, story illogical gun firing murders leave us clueless ! We have seen heroics of Joker in Batman and By Raj in an Indi Cinema but here one fails to laugh. Neither enjoyable as Joker's personal tragedy is going crime provoked path. Difficult to digest senseless out come of incidences. It measurably becomes a pot boiler. It's a fashion to rate this movie high just to give more complexity."
"Joker is a beautifully crafted character study following a man called Arthur as he descends into madness following the events of what he describes as, ""a bad day"".Phillips has managed to create an entirely original and incredibly thought-provoking origin story that keeps some of the Joker's best comic book moments at its core, whilst also altering certain things that have very rarely been changed in the past such as turning Thomas Wayne into a rich snob that looks down on the working class rather than portraying him as a prestigious Doctor, as well as changing not only the Joker's colour scheme but also his face as well. I fell in love with this new rendition of the Joker and I couldn't think of any appearance that would better suit the title of 'The Clown Prince of Crime'. I'd even go as far to say that the Joker's look in this film is probably my favourite Joker look of all time.Initially, the thought of giving the Joker an origin story seemed strange to me, however upon watching the movie I realise that Phillips has been able to make this origin story as vague as possible; was the story itself a literal depiction of what we saw on the screen or was it another story that Arthur made up and told his psychiatrist whilst being locked up in Arkham State Hospital. It could be either, but in my mind, as much as I love the events of the film, I believe that the story of Arthur Fleck becoming Joker is just another story that Joker uses when he is asked about his past. This would then follow the idea explored in 'The Killing Joke' about Joker preferring his past to be, 'multiple choice'. Also, some events of the film are revealed to be delusions taking place in Arthur's mind, such as his relationship with Sophie, and his first appearance on the Murray Franklin Show, so what's not to say that the film itself is just one big delusion.Hopefully a sequel is on the cards, however I can also understand why they would want this film to be a solo flick. It's very rare that you would find a film as artsy and as well created as this to have a sequel. That being said, I do hope that Joaquin Phoenix returns to this role as I would love to see what he can achieve portraying the Joker for the length of a full film rather than just in the the third act."
"Beyond Phoenix excellant portrayal of a wretched mentally ill man...we felt cheated. Anticipated 10 minutes of development and the rest, villany. Sorry..this isn't."
"Since Joaquin Phoenix was announced to play the Joker, i was on the front of the hype train and usually that leads to disappointment, but NOT this time!
This movie has such a gritty and realistic attitude towards it that my girlfriend (who has no clue about comics or Batman but i dragged her along into this!) asked me if this was based on a true story.Yes, the similarities to Taxi Driver, Fight Club and The King Of Comedy are obvious, but that doesn't hurt the movie at all. Some things you might see coming, which i usually hate, but this movie manages to leave more questions open, that it answers, so the enjoyment doesnt end when the movie finishes, you can debate about your theories for hours.I keep my reviews always spoiler free, I just wanna mention that I see what you tried here Todd Phillips, this movie is its own sequel - watch it and you'll understandA lovely character study and instant classic that will never get old. 11 years after Heath Ledger, this might be the next Joker that walks away with the little golden man, at least a nomination seems guaranteed!I can't stress enough how much i enjoyed that approach and would love to see more of these kind of movies, because this is what a comic adaptation really deserves."
"Ok so been to see the JOKER on the back of all the reviews on here saying its a cinematic masterpiece etc etc, and while i cant argue that Phoenix certainly gives an acting masterclass the actual movie itself is dare i say it a bit slow, and a tad boring ( i dont care if you dont agree ) and as for the Joker himself he is no where near as good as the one portrayed by Heath Ledger and no where near as scary.
The Joker here comes across as a sad pitiful character who in all honesty needs a swift boot in the short and curlies followed by a good wash.After i watched the Dark Knight i could not wait to see it again but certainly dont feel that way about JOKER"
"This is not a simple movie , this is a masterpiece ! To see something like this in 2019 is was shocking . I never thought that in my life i would ever seen that kind of act . And i want to thanks Joaquin Pheonix and the entire crew for such a great lesson ,and for his incredible brain strenght ."
"Driving to watch it I was excited while expecting less. I witnessed film history, the work of the greats of today, a screen masterpiece, ""Tennessee Williams"" psychoanalytical deep trip, to be discussed for years."
"I feel like the only person who thought this movie was absolutely terrible and a complete waste of time and money.Firstly it's in no way entertaining. Every scene is an endless indulgence of people trying to be artsy but only accomplishing a boring, frustrating and pointless video of an actor being totally mental. Being completely mental is not hard to script or act, nothing needs to make sense and you don't need any element of normality - enter the joker. Acting on the spectrum is much more difficult - think Forrest Gump, I am Sam or Rain Man.So if it's not meant to be entertaining than what's the point? Just to make you uncomfortable and frustrated? Job done. But who wants to watch that? No thanks.As far as being the joker that's the most disappointing aspect of the film. The character has 0 intelligence, manipulative inclinations or ability to scheme and organise (again he's completely insane). He's also not funny. The joker from the comics is the antithesis of batman. He has no back story, he's clever and cunning and always putting things together. He runs a criminal empire and never acts alone. This joker was a loner, totally insane and gets in a fridge? Also he's far too old to be the joker, when Bruce grows up he'll be fighting an old man. So if it's not a joker origin story then what is it? A poorly scripted, weak story with an agenda to showcase an unrealistic perspective on mental illness.The story moves along at a snail's pace to make allowances for the joker to dance around looking like a fruit cake. The whole movie is uncomfortable and low resolution in its plot and motive. If this is what passes as a good movie then it's a very sad day for humanity 1/10"
"Watched the movie, it was a great performance by Joaquin Phoenix, but it was a performance of a man going insane. The story being about Joker is an offshoot. The Thomas Wayne character is overdone and cocky. DO NOT see this movie as a DC comic version of the Joker it is not."
"Joker didnt have any of the clever banter that we have come to know and love from one of the most well known Villians in history. The pace of this movie was totally off and basically a snooze fest for the first 40 minutes. Joaquin plays a great crazy person, but this origin story doesent give him enough leeway to truly do this movie justice. Some of the mannerisms were spot on, but the demeanor and intelligence level if the villain himself totally capsized any Hope's of enjoying this. The killings were bland and did not bring any desperately needed artistic element to the film. Towards the end, the connection made between the death of one and the rebirth of another was probably the smartest scene, and simply not worth waiting until the end to see. I left the theater in total confusion and dissappointment."
"This movie is beautiful. Phoenix gives a great performance. So why such a low rating? Because this movie is so obviously derivative of Taxi Driver and King of Comedy that Phillips acknowledged it by casting De Niro. But that is not its worst offense. The worst offense is that it ultimately signifies nothing. Since we have an unreliable POV of what actually transpires, after we are shown that Arthur fantasizes his romantic relationship, which was played as real, and his initial appearance on the Murray Franklin show, which was presented falsely in a stylized manner, we don't have any means to discern what was just hallucinations and what was intended to be fact.But who cares? Was Arthur a misunderstood comic genius, a doting son, a vigilante for subway justice, a disowned spawn of a heartless titan of industry, a nurturing lover to a lonely single mother? We don't know the veracity of any interaction in the entire runtime of this movie because nothing is clearly real or false for us to invest our care.Phoenix gives an awesomely weird performance nonetheless. That, and the impeccable production design, is all this movie has going for it. That is what elevates this from being a complete ripoff of better filmmakers and a totally pointless endeavor. Still, the financial success of this movie baffles me. Why do comic fanboys love to see the death of Batman's parents replayed ad nauseam? What insight did this provide into either iconic character which hadn't already been alluded to in more artful ways? I'm hard pressed to find any need for this other than to cash in on the comics movie zeitgeist. It has definitely been successful in that regard."
Give this guy an oscar.. man i love his laugh. His joker makup. My favourate line is 'YOU GET WHAT YOU DESERVE'.. love this guy.❤🤡
"Total flat storyline not a single peak moment, nothing new, nothing amazing, nothing entertaining except the acting. Just a man crying about his existence. We have seen this story a thousand times in thousand different movies also multiple times in batman too. We know that joker struggled a lot in his personal life as a common man, dull story ruined the character. I see people saying a lot good about it maybe just because they can't betray their joker but I like joker for his madness not his crying or sick attitude in his personal life."
As expected Joaquin Phoenix has done a fantastic job. Todd Phillips as director delivers a rounded film. The support from Director of photography and the music seals the deal.Story is a bit weak and lacks a punch that's expected from an iconic character as Joker. Joaquin's performance does cover up that but it's still pretty evident. Worth a watch
"The only thing good about this movie is Phoenixs acting. But i dont (and most people dont) watch movies for acting alone. Good acting doesnt make this movie interesting, entertaining or give it a real plot. What a terrible script and terrible story. Barely any character development (or characters for that matter) outside of Joker. The last 10 minutes were the best part, but to force me to sit through the first 2 hours of garbage to get to it was punishment. Why was this movie even made? They couldve condensed the plot into a 30 minute tv special and made it better than what it was. I cant believe how overrated this movie is, but then again most movies written primarily for oscars usually are."
"I don´t understand the critics this movie is awfull,it is very slow not a lot off action scenes,and jaquin phoenix plays the joker like a little child,the visitors that left
the cinema left the cinema because the film is boring
Joker is a joke and wenn that is the Joker that Batman challenged then Batman has a easy job"
I Have rarely been as disappointed in a movie as i have been with this one. I went in expecting a deep interesting and entertaining movie. What i got was an awkward incredibly boring film. All that hype for something that is 60% the joker being awkward. I kept waiting for it to pick up and become interesting. I was expecting something on the level with Heath Ledgers joker but it failed to gain my interest in the least. Like many critically acclaimed films this movie was a complete joke to me.
"Outstanding, The best film i watched this year. very gory and haunting,
but joaquin's performance is perfect and the plot was unpredictable."
"2 hours of watching a seemingly (at the outset) normal person with a job, home, loving mother, maybe a bit of an unusual medical condition, slowly descend into complete madness and destruction.Great visuals, well shot, I am old and not easily disturbed and I found the portrayal of psychosis so completely believable it scared the hell out of me. Masterpiece."
"If someone goes into the Joker movie thinking they are getting a Marvel style comic book movie they will be bored, confused and probably not like it much. To me this is much more a study of severe mental illness and the character development of a person on the fringe with delusions of grandeur and psychotic episodes. To me Joker is what happens when Taxi Driver takes place in a DC world.I would recommend watching this movie like you would Fight Club, Memento or Inception. Be open to the story within the story, try to figure out the true story arc.I went into the movie believing I would see a classic linear, but adult narrative, about an arch villain origin story. But this movie is much much more. I began to realize Joker was an untrustworthy narrator (though done in more of a third person) in the scene with Murray taking a shine to Arthur.Later the scene with Sophie where she doesn't know Arthur drove it home. A big AHA moment. I began to understand the nature of this movie.From then on, I was trying to figure out what really happened and what didn't. It was hard to unravel and kept me guessing. This is exactly what kept the movie interesting and is at it heart what the Joker is.This movie nailed what it is like trying to have a relationship with someone who has delusions, hallucinations or psychotic episodes. One never knows what is real, what is imagined and what is partially real and partially embellished. Unfortunately I know all too well from my personal life where two very close family members suffer from delusions and psychotic episodes.You can't put a rational lens on an irrational mind and expect clarity. Sometimes I think that rational people expect severely mentally ill people to have an a ha moment, to self reflect, to examine their irrational thoughts, or to realize they are having these episodes and have that inner rational mind that let's them know this isn't real. To someone suffering from these conditions, the psychotic episode/delusion/hallucination is realty, and those moments of clarity rarely if ever occur. When they do it is a huge breakthrough often brought on by intense therapy.The result is a confusing mash of episodes, blurred reality and moments of random clarity. It is chaos. I think this movie does an admirable job of trying to mesh these conditions with keeping within the confines of a DC world ethos.The Joker character is living in this world of psychotic chaos, and can not easily be explained in a linear or rational way. The Joker's origin is as confusing and chaotic after the movie as it was before the movie, as it should be.More than any statement about society, this movie is a statement of how misunderstood the people suffering from severe mental illnesses are. As the viewer we have an invitation into this most intimate world, told by the Joker. It uncomfortably nails down how awkward and confusing it is to have a personal or professional relationship with a deeply mentally ill person. Viewers of the Joker get a 2 hour taste of that very experience. There are mixes of sympathy and anger toward Arthur, and you never quite know what is real and what is not.To me this is high cinema wrapped in a DC world, and I hope it opens up a societal discussion on understanding mental illness. Early in the movie Arthur asks for more medications and the Psychiatrist he is seeing says he is on a dozen or so pills. It is a direct jab at the mental health profession that closed down mental health resources and opened the prescription pad in the 90's. You can't medicate someone out of the worst mental illnesses.IMO this movie will age very well, and more discussion will come out of it."
"Script and Story move the spectator into a drama from now unknown in the DC universe.
Joaquin Phenix is the really joker 🃏."
A true masterpiece. A film with a solid plot with a great cast and director. This is an origin story we have all been waiting for. Can't wait to see what's in store for Joker.
"I know the name Todd Phillips from his first feature as a student film maker, the 1993 cult documentary on extreme punk rocker, GG Allin, 'Hated: GG Allin and The Murder Junkies. Joker has a few references to GG littered throughout. Joaquin's performance is breathtakingly outstanding. Fantastic movie. 10/10"
"""Every story needs its hero. And its villain. And its monster.""
The Caped Crusader of Gotham City was never complete without his villain, the Joker. What made The Dark Knight (2008) a phenomenal success at the box office and as an all time cult classic was the characterization of the agent of chaos and seamless delivery of witful dialogues and challenges. It wasn't a surprise that the people loved the Joker more than the Batman himself in the film, for he, the Joker, didn't have any rules to play by. It was unfortunate that Heath Ledger had to leave this world, and thus creating a permanent vacuum in the Gotham City. There had been attempts by Jared Leto to fulfill the gap, but it is no match.DC had to come up with a solo Joker movie that was due for long. Joaquin Phoenix had been creating the buzz ever since the first look poster arrived and looks-wise he was almost..almost matching the legend of Heath Ledger. With much expectations, the Joker is finally here.Set in 1981, Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) is a disregarded personality who works as a clown at places wherever needed and lives with his mom Penny. With a rare neurological condition, he suffers from frequent and inopportune laughter which irks people around him. The city as such is infested with crime and unemployment all over, hence there is no question of sympathy or concern for special characters such as him. Struggling to make a mark as a stand up comedian, Arthur also suffers from delusions where he is unable to distinguish reality from dreams. Things go topsy-turvy when one of his colleagues hands him over a gun to take care of miscreants who harm him. Arthur uses it against 3 rogue employees of Wayne Enterprises. While the cops are in search for Arthur, he also is in constant battle to come up as a comedian, pursue his neighborhood crush, find out the true identity of his father and take care of his mom. When he finds an answer to most of these, how he handles them and emerges as the Gotham City rebellion is the plot.The movie has its high moments in the seamless change of expressions and body language of Joaquin. The audience will be in for a shock to see his shirtless episodes where he reminds one of Christian Bale from The Machinist (2004 The background score in most places takes the cue from The Dark Knight and builds over it to make us feel the connect. Also there are too many frames that resemble the ones of Heath Ledger, which possibly could be a deliberate attempt. ). For those expecting a Batman cameo in this movie - the answer is both YES and NO.While this movie could easily be a grandeur in performances, one cannot get the rush that was given by the one played by Heath Ledger. Surely, there cannot be a comparison to the 2008 Joker version, for that set its standards too high that any more attempts can only keep trying to scale up half way. We can only hope the sequel to this one has much more interesting elements, for the movie ends with enough scope for that hope!"
"Started off a little slow, but it was all important for the development of the Joker. Loved this movie and Phoenix has definitely earned all of the praise. The ""statement"" of this movie is loud and clear and I think it needs to be heard by as many people as possible."
"Joker is an excellent insight (albeit exaggerated) of society's view of mental health.
Arthur has serious mental health issues, caused or at least exacerbated, by childhood trauma and his relationship with his mother. Society isn't able to support Arthur adequately and his delusions and mental health are spiralling out of control. The movie allows us to have pity with Arthur, where it's clear that the 'system' has failed him.
Throughout the movie society ridicules him, work mates, members of the public, the general population (via Murray's TV show). His interaction with the lady and child on the bus is a startling revelation as to how, even though the member of the public is made aware of his condition, still shows no empathy or understanding and merely shuns him.Under no circumstances can we ever condone the violence, but the question Arthur poses to Murray towards the end of the movie should be a stark warning.
Ultimately, the way we treat our vulnerable members of society, our tolerance, understanding, empathy and support will determine who how society will develop. And we may well get what we deserve.This is exceptional movie and will become a classic (although won't be on each Xmas 😄)"
"When Batman made his debut the year was 1939. In Europe, the nazism was offering a solution to poverty: the chosen and pure ones have to take the lead to organize a better life. This fascist thing was also in the air after the communism had shown its contradictions and violence. With the victory in the II World War liberal democratic countries had to propose a new version of capitalism. This human version, the Welfare State, went through more or less till the 70's when the neoliberalism arrived in the political scene advocating cuts in social expenditures and state shrinking. In a way, Batman and Joker were created from the same ground of despair and hope in the mid of the last century. We are now in 2019. The welfare state capitalism is in the hospital badly wounded. The evil may be explained by a real troubled life of the Joker maybe not. As Joker realizes his potency after every crime perpetrated by him, the young batman must accomplish a double task in the future: to turn Gothan city a livable place for all and to dismantle the joker's way of the necessary use of violence by the dispossessed. If Batman fails in this noble tale, the fascism will come again to organize the jokers promising a better life. Great Film!"
I don't give many movies 10 /10 but could think how they would improve it. The acting was simply amazing. If there's no oscars then it's a travesty. It dark and scary. Deeply sad and tragic. Violent and bloody. Bloody brilliant is what it is!
"'Joker' is the type of film that you want to rewatch immediately yet never watch again; it's as deeply disturbing as it is utterly compelling, leading to a unique experience that truly sticks with you. The pure visceral effect of it literally lasts for days, and once that wears off the narrative still lingers in your mind, something truly rare in today's age of cinema. It's an incredibly grounded character study, with one of the most complex protagonists in years. He's not a hero, but not quite a villain either. It's far more complicated than that, purely because it's simply far more realistic than that. Arthur fleck is just presented as a person, one who you aren't supposed to empathise with but rather pity. The film never forces you to feel a certain way about him either, as it just shows the events in a relatively unbiased way, which allows for different audience interpretations. The filmmaking here is fantastic, with everything from the cinematography and production design to the haunting score putting most films to shame. It still astounds me that Todd Phillips directed this as it's in a completely different league to anything he's helmed before. For all it's technical, behind-the-camera excellency though, there's no doubt that this wouldn't have been nowhere near as successful without Joaquin Phoenix's masterful performance. It has been said before, but it needs to be said again: this guy deserves the Oscar. It's far and away the best performance of the year, and is perhaps one of the best performances I've ever seen. Phoenix's mere presence here demands your attention and he completely throws himself headfirst into the role, outdoing himself in the process (a very high praise for an actor of his talents indeed). Sure, the writing is great too, but Phoenix completely sells Arthur's transformation in such a convincing way that I'm sure the performance could have overcame bad writing had it needed to. Thankfully though, Phoenix is matched by the film surrounding him, which just solidifies how great the whole thing is. Like I said, it's a very disturbing, even scary, watch that is completely absorbing from the opening frame. It's not fun, but it isn't supposed to be. It knows what it wants to be, establishes this very early on, and rolls with it, completely sticking the landing. It's an incredibly accomplished work and if DC stick to this route from now on, they'll soon become the leading company in comic book adaptations. 9/10"
"I'm Going to start with this : One of the Top 10 best acting performances I've ever seen, Joaquin Phoenix Was Genius.
The Movie is Dark, unsettling, physically painful but in a good way.
haunting score, Great Soundtrack, Incredible directing and screenplay, the only problem I had with this film is the ending a small problem really, i felt that it needed something more.
Anyway this film will be talked about for years to come, i highly recommend it."
"It's a shame now adays that the so called know it all critics cant just watch a movie without injecting their own political spin on their opinion. A 59 metacritic for this while knives out started as 100 on tomatoes goes to show there is an agenda, and not a genuine critique.That being said, Joker is a phenomenal movie. It's a dreary journey through the mind of an iconic character and for the first time we get to watch every thread if his humanity get pulled away until he finally becomes who he really is, and to some extent, who we all are. The tone of this movie is consistent and his transformation is paces perfectly and believable. DC needed a movie like this to do this character justice in a way that did by look like it was drawn by Kane.Todd Phillip's nailed every aspect...from the music and timing of when and what played, the creepy and sullen atmosphere, the feeling of hopelessness till the final act...its hard at times to not root for the Joker even though you know what he becomes.I cannot recommend this movie enough. Critics have shown themselves and biased lemmings. Pay no attention to them. They are the very thing Joker is trying to stamp out."
"Joker is a origin story of the infamous villian of DC universe. Its a mixture of violence and emotions. After watching this movie i have became a fan of director Todd Phillips (its the same guy who directed the comical triology The Hangover). His idea of presenting the story was fabulous. He knows how to intrigue audience with the story of the film. I have read many review of ths flim saying that the first half is slow but trust me i didn't feel that the first half was slow. First half shows the struggling mental state of Arthur Fleck aka Joker played by Joaquin Phoenix and second half shows his transformation to JOKER.
About Joaquin Phoenix he just showed us a new version of Joker as the character was played by a lot of great actors like Jack Nicholson and my favourite Heath Ledger. Can't imagine how much pressure would be on Mr. Phoenix to play joker but he did a fantastic job👏. BGM also adds more feels to this movie.
Conclusion : its a violent movie so very R rated but a must watch. A person need not have comic book knowledge to watch this brilliant peice of art as the movie has very less references to other universe. Everyone can watch this movie."
The movies makes you feel uncomfortable. You understand that what is happening is wrong yet you understand why...
"For me I call tell, this movie is one of the best movies I have ever seen in my entire life in term of acting, sound effects, story,..... despite of having very dark depressing moments in this movie, you still sense the feeling of greatness after finish watching the movie.
First time ever to watch a realistic comic movie which made him a one of a kind.
The problem is this movie might encourage some evil things in our real world to whose see themselves in this movie in a way or another, the fact that the moments and situations you experienced in the joker might happened to you through your life, how many times you got a depressing situations where someone enjoys making fun of you or mocking your life, character, origin, religion, skin color. Ideology or even just bullying you in school. Let's think about that. Hurting someone's feeling is funny it can destroys everything"
"It's an old school movie kinda like Clockwork Orange. The scenario is so tied and no rushing. It makes the movie untouchable, or I would say bounded. This is why It's strong and old school."
No surprises here. This was just the same idea played over over and over. How about that Joker Ballet in the toilet?! Hilariously bad.
"JOKER character should have been much better presented in a more psycho-path life. Suffering like in the movie is not a good cause for such a character to rise. I expected a lot from a movie rated over 9, and really disappointed with it. We were 8 watching and 4 said not worth the ticket. Hoaquin did a great job, but the scenario and directing were poor."
"Todd Phillips and Joachin Phoenix have dug deep.. really deep, unearthing the first Joker character that is believable, not only in the comic book world, but in our world, the real world.The acting from Phoenix is stunning, almost too good at times which make some scenes excruciating to watch. A man's mental stability and health spiralling uncontrollably without filter. The cinematography is also spectacular, influenced largely on Scorsese's Taxi Driver as are other elements of this movie.There are also glaring similarities between this Joker and Rupert Pupkin from The King of Comedy, however De Niro's character study, in my opinion, is better, but only just.Todd Philips' direction is well balanced and he guides us between tension and climax just right.Overall, Joker is dark and not like any other comic book movie, which is truly a good thing."
Simply amazing. Could have stayed and watched it again. Wish it had been longer. Absolutely phenomenal film. Epic.
"AMAZING. HAUNTING. STUNNING. SAD. REALISTIC. BEAUTIFUL.I love Joaquin Phoenix in anything he does because he masterfully embodies his character.The cinematography. The music. The score. The mood. The chilling unpredictability. The deliberate pace of the development. The plot line. The twists.... Just about everything about this film is perfect example of a perfect film!Wayne Manor?
That dancing?
The joker in jeans smoking?
The unraveling?
Robert DeNiro?!Suffice it to say, I've already pre-ordered.*Forget the critics reviews (NYT, I'm disappointed)
*Forget nit picky reviewers rating 7s because they don't like the somber score or because there wasn't enough bloodshed; spellcheck before you rate. LOL"
"Joker was an amazing movie and Joaquin Phoenix was perfect for this role, the acting was brilliant. Please consider that Phoenix's Joker is a journey to becoming the Heath's Joker and in my opinions it was perfect. Close to the end of the movie you can see a glimpse of Heat's Joker, the one that embraces his madness and starts enjoying being the villain."
Oscar worthy performance by Joaquin Phoenix and incredible detailed so much power in todd mind brilliant direction amazingly written and outstanding score lovely combination thats what we called a True Masterpiece. All Hail to the JOKER.. i want this watch again ng again....
"After I watched Joker, I needed some time to really digest it. Joker is like no other comic book/superhero movie that has ever existed. It truly transcends the genre and almost breaks it entirely. It is the kind of movie I have been wanting to see take place in the Batman universe since the Nolan films: dark, disturbing, gritty, adult, and completely the antithesis of Marvel and all it's Disney friendly content.Joaquin Phoenix is amazing in this movie. My wife asked me if he was better than Heath Ledger and Jack Nicholson as Joker. My first reaction was that he was not, but it is because he is playing a character for the entirety of the movie that is still in the process of becoming Joker. Phoenix has created a an original character that takes very little from previous Joker portrayals. It is so different from Heath and Jack that comparisons seem unfair and unnecessary.The movie looks fantastic and beautifully shot. You can really tell the Scorsese influence, but I am 100% of the opinion that this is not a copy of Taxi Driver or King of Comedy, heavily influenced, yes, but most certainly something new. Todd Phillips deserves credit for making a movie that does not seek to please the comic book/superhero audience and instead gives them something challenging like nothing that has come before in this genre.I do have some small criticisms in terms of the plot, but they do not plague the film enough to knock it down. I recommend this highly. (A-)"
"Ignore these haters, trust me. They're extremely biased and are simply hating this movie because people like it and because they expect it to be something that it isn't.Things you MUST know before you watch the movie is that this isn't a ""Batman"" movie. It's not an action movie. If you're expecting a ton of action and explosions and a lot happening then this isn't the right movie for you.This movie is a drama. It's a drama about a man named Arthur and how he became ""Joker."" It doesn't really go into details or explore his childhood. The movie is about a very small portion of Arthur's life that happened just right up to before he becomes ""Joker."" The premise is pretty simple and not overly complicated.The reason this movie is loved is because it's beautifully shot and executed. The acting is superb, the cinematography is beautiful, the score is chilling, the art and flow is very poetic. This is not a movie you watch with your eyes. This is a movie that you must watch with your mind. It goes deep into the human psyche. It presents simple things in a different light. It dances, literally AND figuratively between light and dark, good and bad, right and wrong. You have to pay attention or you'll miss the message.I enjoyed the movie and I believe it's a type of movie that requires multiple viewings to get the full experience. There's a lot of subtle details that are easily missed even if you pay attention."
This movie made me want to walk outside and kill everyone ..... anyone who gets in my way from now on I'm just going to think of this movie and kill them all !
I don't have words to explain the acting of Joker. Outstanding performance- What a legend. The Oscar is sure.
"Joker was a complete masterpiece for anyone who loves a good dark piece of this world. The starting, the rollercoaster rides of emotions and the clever use of music were all points of minute observation. The trial of making it into the exact 70s climate was great with the super rats and garbage lying around. The movie surely is an eye opener in a way for those who want to understand the side effects of being under constant pressure and turmoil. The audience surely loved the impact it had on stigma against going to a psychologist. This movie surely is worth every penny."
"Yes, Joaquin Phoenix does a wonderful job in his portrayal of the Joker. Albeit this Joker is plain and simple just mentally ill. He is generally portrayed in previous genres as a criminal genius mastermind. A person with wit, and masterful comprehension of trickery, and chemicals.This Joker is no fun, and highly delusional. You may question his intellect as he has to look up simple jokes in a diary he keeps. Yes, for the most part his jokes fall flat. Jack Nicholson' clever portrayal in Batman raised the bar that in my opinion has never quite been reached.I found myself uncomfortable with this portrayal as you would with someone acting out next to you on a subway. In that respect, Joaquin portrays this bit of brazen craziness to a tee. Craziness for the sake of craziness does not make for entertainment. If a sane person were locked up in a mental institution, you would not be entertained. And that is a bit how this movie felt."
"Joaquin the Great..
The Joker Genius.
Creativity in writing, directing and acting.
Incredibly crazy, but rational mad."
Very different from all the past interpretations of the character
"This movie is a rally to the bottom of obscurity - I strongly suggest not watching it if you can. It is, simply put: psychologically draining.The quality of the plot is mixed. It has some interesting suspense on how it all might end. Nevertheless, in reality some other parts of are rather predictable and obvious.Additionally, the rhythm is rather dull and it has none of the action you would see in the dark night (if that's what your looking for).It's also bothering to see how it portrays a divide in a troubled society. Even though we know Gotham is product of fiction, it draws parallels to our society - exacerbating its negative sides - while trying to make them appear normal.Also beware that some of the scenes are utterly grotesque. The violence is quite explicit and unlike other films - realistic."
"Unrelentingly, irredeemably dark with no story, no arc, and lots of unnecessary frames left onscreen. Too long by 1/3
Phoenix delivers a fine performance, better because the material he had to work with was so weak and thin. I wanted to walk out from the halfway point onward but kept hoping for a redeeming 3rd reel.
Nope. Just more and increasingly gratuitous violence, more darkness and attempts to clumsily weave in origin stories we have all seen. Saw this for $1.72 on a Season Pass and wanted my money back."
It's great. Just wow. Yes it was violent but it was less violent than John wick and Deadpool.
"Amazing hype and outstanding performance for Phoenix, now I feel bad for the Joker. It's not an aggressive play like I heard, it's all about action & reaction for a society which is full of haters & madness."
"GO WATCH JOKER RN,Hounestly the best performance in a movie tied with Marlon Brando in godfather and heath ledger in dark knight, never have I seen such a well made comic book movie since dark knight, joker was amazing and it proves that comic book movies can be masterpieces too"
"This movie is probably about a 7.2. It is pretty enjoyable. It isn't as good as the people who are paid to post fake reviews here claim but those people are easily discovered by the fact that they rate every move 10/10.It is worse than the Dark Knight and I didn't find the Joker better than Heath's or Jack Nicholson's
This isn't an action movie so people going into it expecting that won't get it but it is a good character study which unfortunately may be boring to many people. Reminded me of There Will be Blood than Batman"
I am a DC fan but this movie is a art house movie pretending to be a comic book movie. Boring and drawn out.
"Feels a bit like Requiem for a Dream meets Taxi Driver, but not nearly as good as either. Was there a single memorable script line or cerebral plot twist in the entire film? Not that I noticed."
"Tge film is too Slowt gets boring
Ok story line
Good acting from joker
I dont know what all this hype is about"
"""Joker"" is highly derivative and a poor imitation of better Scorsese movies. The movie didn't really know what it was trying to say. On top of that it's very cynical and will leave you with a bad taste in your mouth. Great performance from Joaquin Phoenix but it's not essential viewing."
"Crazy good performance by Phoenix, the tv show scene at the end is total immersion rarely seen. Cinematography and soundtrack is also stellar.The story on the other hand is really weak. Phillips decided - instead of actually say something real and of value that embarks discussions - to write a story about nothing as it's filled with red herrings across the board and an open ending. As we don't know what happened or not, about anything, everything is also without meaning. We can only guess.It's just lazy writing to let the viewer guess what ever the happened or not."
"Astonishing acting and directing, mind exploding scenes and heartbreaking moments that makes you laugh and cry at the same time. Just bravo"
Other than that. This is a well directed movie with great performances.
"This movie is a cinematic piece of art that must not be missed!People complaining that it was drawn out and had no plot are completely missing the point of the movie. It was a psychological analysis of a diathesis stress illness, namely schizophrenia. A man's decent into darkness after a childhood of abuse. It wasn't meant to be a Hollywood blockbuster with fast cars and CGI fighting rubbish.It was utterly necessary to have the elongated beginning, otherwise the brilliant cinematography and score at the conclusion would not have been so impactful.Phoenix, as usual, gave us a masterclass in acting. He lived every tiny schizophrenic moment of Fleck's mind and played it to perfection. If he doesn't win the Oscar this time, I swear I'll never watch it again!For me, this is the movie of the decade. I rarely see a movie twice, but I'm going back for this one a second time. 10 stars."
"The movie JOKER, which had its world premiere at Venice 2019 and won the Golden Lion best film award on the Lido, has been mistakenly termed a ""comic book film"". True it is in a sense spinoff from the comic book based Batman film series, however, this is a serious non-comic book psychological study of how a would be stand-up comedian with a pathetic laughing syndrome goes wrong and becomes a psychotic killer. Joaquin Phoenix, 44, with his astounding interpretations of this peculiar character has now clearly established himself as the new king of Hollywood and even knocks off one of the old kings, Robert De Niro, in a short but telling sequence.
Basically this is a speculative account of how a notoriously evil public enemy, later to be known as ""The Joker"", started out as an innocent clown who loved his mother but was the victim of a ""condition"" (uncontrollable laughter) which made him a societal outcast and eventually warped his mind. His first killing which was basically in self defense when brutally attacked by three ""respectable"" men in a metro car is interpreted by the media as unmotivated murder because only we in the audience saw the brutal kicking attack. The irony is that the gun he pulled on them was given him by a fellow clown to use only in self defense. It turns out that his widowed mother has dark secrets of her own (which will peripherally connect us with the future Batman) but Phoenix as wannabe comedian ""Arthur Fleck "" (what a spotty name!) takes this role to the outer limits of the twilight zone as his frenzied laughter becomes more and more menacing. His constant disclaimer is ""I have a condition"" -- and what a condition it will turn out to be! -- culminating in his live on TV shooting of a Jay Leno type talk show host (De Niro) who, fascinated by his personality has invited Fleck to appear as a special guest. Not enough can be said of Joaquin Phoenix's bravura performance and the end result of this masterful film (Kudos to director Todd Phillips as well) is to shock you out of your pants. But a kind of shock that is exhilarating in the cinematic artistic and social sense."
"Greetings again from the darkness. The first thing to know is that this is not a Superhero movie. In fact, there are no heroes in the movie - unless you would like to apply the label to a single mom who lives down the hall from Arthur Fleck. Mr. Fleck lives at home with his invalid mother in a grungy, run-down apartment. He works as a clown-for-hire, dreams of becoming a stand-up comedian, and depends on social services to supply the 7 medications he takes since being released from Arkham State Hospital. It's a bleak existence at a bleak time in a bleak city. Gotham is in the midst of a garbage workers' strike (only the 'super rats' are happy), political upheaval, and a growing chasm between the classes. And then it gets worse for Arthur.The second thing to know is that this is a standalone Joker film, and one mostly unrelated or not connected to previous projects featuring the colorful Clown Prince character played (and voiced) by such memorable actors as Cesar Romero, Jack Nicholson, Heath Ledger, Mark Hamill, Jared Leto and even Zach Galifianakis. Director Todd Phillips (who co-wrote the script with Scott Silver) is best known for such extreme comedies as ""The Hangover"" franchise and OLD SCHOOL, so he's a bit outside of his usual wheelhouse. Phillips and Silver seem to embrace not just the history of the character, but also the look, texture and tone of filmmaking from an earlier era. The gritty and outcast feel of Scorcese's TAXI DRIVER and THE KING OF COMEDY is present, and so are numerous tributes to familiar Joker moments of days gone by.Three time Oscar nominee Joaquin Phoenix plays Arthur Fleck, and he delivers Arthur's slow descent into madness, or shall we say further descent. It's clear from the beginning that Arthur views himself as ignored by society, while all he wants to do is bring joy and laughter to others ... and be noticed. His daydreams or visions of himself in a better world send a strong message. Phoenix shows us what full commitment to a role looks like. He lost 50 pounds, leaving a frame that contorts, moves and dances in a manner unlike what we've seen before. In fact, it's a toss-up on which shows up more frequently, his dances moves or his maniacal, pained laughter. We are informed Arthur suffers from Pseudobulbar Affect, also known as emotional incontinence, which causes that creepy laughter to pop up at some inappropriate times. Of course, the comparisons to Heath Ledger's Oscar winning turn in THE DARK KNIGHT are inevitable. The roles and films are written quite differently, and it's safe to say both actors were all-in.Action sequences and special visual effects are both noticeably absent, but the violence is sure to shock. This is not one for the younger kids, no matter how much they enjoy THE AVENGERS or WONDER WOMAN (or any other DC or Marvel film). This gritty, visceral approach is often a tough watch, and is much more a character study of mental illness than a costume drama ... although Arthur's clothes and make-up are front and center. When Arthur states, ""I have nothing but bad thoughts"", we believe him. And the sympathetic back story explains a great deal, and will likely prove quite controversial.Phoenix dominates the film (as he should), and supporting work is provided by Robert De Niro as Murray Franklin, a TV talk show host in the Johnny Carson mode; Zazie Beetz (DEADPOOL 2) as the single mom neighbor Sophie Dumond; Frances Conroy as Penny Fleck, Arthur's mother; Brett Cullen as a not so empathetic Thomas Wayne; and Shea Whigham and Bill Camp as police detectives. I'll hesitantly mention that Dante Pereira-Olson makes a couple of brief appearances as an adolescent Bruce Wayne, and just for fun, we get a shot of the young man honing the batpole skills he will use later in life. Just don't expect any ""real"" Batman references.Director Phillips delivers a film that looks and feels and sounds much different than other comic book movies. Cinematographer Lawrence Sher is a frequent Phillips collaborator (all 3 Hangover movies) and the dark look and gritty feel are present in most every shot. Hildur Guonadottir (this year's Emmy winner for ""Chernobyl"") serves up a foreboding score - one that never overwhelms, and one that contrasts perfectly with the more traditional songs utilized throughout: Stephen Sondheim's ""Send in the Clowns"", Jimmy Durante singing ""Smile"", Cream's ""White Room"", ""That's Life"" by Frank Sinatra, and Gary Glitter's familiar ""Rock and Roll Part 1 and 2"". The ""Smile"" song is especially relevant as its origins can be traced by to Charlie Chaplin's MODERN TIMES, a silent movie classic featured in this film. Phillips even uses the Saul Bass designed Warner Bros logo to open the credits, making sure we understand the time period (no cell phones, etc).The film traces Arthur's slide into crime ... a transition that he wasn't seeking, and one that he believes was forced upon him. His rise as a savior to the working class is secondary to his own journey, and the chaos is handled on the perimeters of the film, preventing this from becoming a Super Villain movie. Keep in mind JOKER played at Venice, Telluride and Toronto - three prestigious festivals. This is just another thing that sets it apart from others in the genre. Despite the 1981 time stamp, the consistent anti-rich message and class disparity is prevalent throughout. This appears to be Phillips' way of including a contemporary theme in a decades-old setting. And it's a cautionary tale that there should be no clown left behind."
"This movie is absolute perfection, I was lucky enough to see this at a festival and WOW. Phoenix's performance is incredible and so deep into the role. He truely shows how damaged the joker should be portrayed as. He will definitely be at the top for best actor. The movie is disturbing and terrifying of how the world is to people with mental health and deserves to at least be nominated best picture."
Felt like a 2 hour trailer waiting for the joker while a bozo smoked cigs and walked around doing fk all. Finally the last 5 minutes came and i thought wow we have a movie then it ended. Id rather spend my 20 on some face paint and some pints and actually enjoy my life. This will go down as one of the days where the long awaited hype was flushed down the toilet. Thank you for that.
"This is a good movie. Dark, tragic and brooding. So many excellent aspects to it. Great acting, sets, costumes. Fantastic score.But...The context is that this is The Joker of Batman Nemeses notoriety. The film just doesn't fit. Arthur is a truly sad and tragic, disturbed and intellectually challenged character. His back story is deeply disturbing and one cannot help but feel sympathy if not empathy. The REAL Joker is not a sad victim. He is a malevolent, intelligent maniac. Not someone you have an ounce of sympathy for.I think this movie fails because of this context. If it was purely a study into the psychological development of a sociopath I think it would be excellent. Sadly it is not. It is the origin story of a comic book baddie. Nothing comic book baddie about this miserable human.There are a few other issues I had with it, there primary one being that he is incapable of coherent speech and social interaction throughout the movie but he suddenly is able to produce a powerful monologue on set in front of a live audience and in front of TV cameras and his former idol. I understand that his confidence grows the less he has to lose but I found this jarring and dissonant.I also found his fantasy relationship silly and then overly ""explained"".That aside, Joachim is phenomenal!! A one man tour de force. Truly believable if not relatable.This is a must see for his performance but I think Batman fans will be disappointed."
"A total blunder. Joker is the worst kind of movie, pretending it´s deep, philosophical, structured and with a thorough plot. Well, it's nothing of that and it's as hollow as hollow can be. You take an exceptional actor, make him mimic de Niro in Taxi Driver, give him some eccentric dance steps on a staircase, produce a nice trailer, and.... voilá, you fool half of the world with pure nothingness. Joker. What a joke!"
So much bad
"The first hour is a boar with too much emphasis upon protraying what we already know...the Joker is crazy. Two senseless murders, one too graphic.
Hopefully the sequel will be better.
Good acting by Jaquine."
"This movie had a lot of potential. A very suitable actor (Phoenix) for the role as looker seemed perfect, and his acting was fine! But the movie is too damn slow! The directing for this movie was just bad. Also the cliche moment of this movie were to obvious..."
"If it had not been for Gotham surroundings and the presence of The Wayne family, this sad joke of a film could have been just a flat portrayal of some sad loser with mental issues...But where is the criminal mastermind and superintelligent vilain ? Is this sad sick loser supposed to challenge Batman ?How ? In his dreams maybe ? Btw. What was the end supposed to show? That this was an illusion all the way ?
Did Hollywood forget the first rule of film entertainment? That the film is supposed to entertain you ? This rule goes for comics genre too! But where was entertainment in this ? If you want to make a film about a mental case turning into a murderer why exploit the comics genre and famous brands such as Batman or Gotham City? Here is the answer: nobody would be interested....sadly, such Joker is not interesting either..."
Joker Movie is going to make a revolution like Watchmen. It's just a masterpiece which shows our society.
"Heath Ledger or Joaquin Phoenix? Here is the question. Except that in my mind there is no question. 100% Heath Ledger. And here is the reason why: while Ledger was perfect comic book character, Phoenix' character is more disturbing version of Joker. He is mentally ill and seriously needs help. I don't say that Ledger's joker wasn't crazy, He was somewhat crazy but in that movie everything is done in a way that we know it's comic book movie, good versus bad and that's it. 2019 Joker is more disturbing. There is a lot of emotion put in this movie which one would say is good thing but it's done in such manner that somehow we feel sorry for character and somehow even justify his actions. Violence is never the answer. No matter how bad your life is or how many people have hurt you, it is never an option. However, the creators of this movie seem to think differently. There you can hear triumphant music playing when Joker killed all those people. Also, movie is a shock value, unoriginal and uninspiring. The Dark Knight was really interesting movie to watch, everything was somewhat coherent in there. In Joker we have a lot of dancing, laughing, killing and mental breakdowns. To sum up - it's trash."

"I'm 36 now, this is my first review ever. Only because I'm sick of all of this. I don't want to sound like an old, miserable man. But Hollywood is failing on me, time and time again.Just to name a few: the last Blade Runner, the last Star Wars, Toy Story 4, Avengers Infinity War, Endgame, etcetera, etcetera. All the big ones. Disappointment after disappointment. And then there's Joker. I hoped it was the exception... But, no.Apparently, the only way to get good reviews is by hyping and trolling the media and with that, people's opinions and wallets. It's too easy, too boring, too shallow.Where are the storylines? In all of the above there is none to be found. No plot whatsoever. No rememberable scenes or quotes. Empty. Nada!It's even the opposite of a plot: all these movies just don't make any sense. These so-called 'plots' are written in meeting rooms. Bad, bad compromises that only check all the boxes for the laws of Hollywood. And people fall for it.And I just wonder if I'm the only one who thinks:
1. Joker is a joke
2. Hollywood is a joke
3. Review systems are a jokeThis makes me realize it's not just in the cinema that people let themselves be fooled. Think about elections.And this review will be trolled as well. Keep thinking for yourselves guys!"
"Let me start off by saying the cinematography is as good as people say. The acting is also truly impressive and for those that are not into comic book movies this should be a great depiction. But that's also where I find myself wondering how people are even putting Joker into the same ballpark as The Dark Knight. The issue I have is the same issue I had with Suicide Squad. The Joker isn't just an insane man causing chaos as far as he walks. He is calculated and intelligent. Striking the perfect balance between insane and I wonder is it all an act. In this movie I only witnessed an mental disturbed man with pain in is life go off the rails. I never felt he had the capacity to formulate a world ending plot, bit rather just finds himself fortunate to have everything fall in place. Still a great movie,it's just not The Joker."
"Whilst the acting is superb, this movie could do without the whole Joker ""sauce"" being poured on the story.It revolves about a man gliding off into madness in a society that does not care about providing sufficient help for his problems. As his medications and little therapy he got were taken away due to budget cuts, he goes further and further into the Abyss of his madness. Phoenix does a wonderful job portraying the protagonist!Unfortunately this movie would have so been much better without the Joker/Batman elements. It is difficult to believe that this weak man we see in this movie turns out to be the crime kingpin that we love and fear. As such it did not meet up to my expectations."
"Watched this in theathre, everyone including me was glued to see the transformation of Arthur.To me, this movie simply is 'almost perfect'."
J.phoenix is astonishing in this gripping story of how the joker came to be.do not miss this movie.
The movie was to slow and had a lot of dead ends. He was crazy because his mom was crazy and he was abused as a child. There was no real point to the story. Maybe it's good if you haven't been around people with mental health problems but if you have then you probably won't like it
"Wow. I can't believe what I watched. Not in a good way. Although the filmmakers said this was ""king of comedy"" or ""taxi driver"" it most certainly is not. Sorry to be saying this. I wanted to love it so much, and it was only reaching an entertaining moment in the last 15 min when it actually starts turning into a comic book movie. Although Joaquin created a very deep and dark Joker, he has nobody to bounce off of. The character in a Batman or actual Arkham Asylum scenario would be very interesting I didn't find this version very interesting. Also unfortunately I don't see anything in this Joker movie that makes me think Todd Phillips could reach anything close to Taxi Driver. There were a lot of topics touched on (race, poverty, mental health, comedy) that never really felt like they hit a real point of view."
"Acting and cinematography are outstanding. Joaquin is incredible throughout. That's as far as the compliments go.The plot lacks any creativity, it's unnecessarily dark and smacks of a sequel within 15 minutes of being seated in the theatre. I get there has to be some character development but at least leave the feeling of getting rinsed for cash until the end of the movie.Whilst I appreciate the inevitability of the Joker's story being told, I feel the consistently dark nature of the film left me bereft of any positivity. Nolan achieved the balance; this movie did not. This was highlighted when the audience laughed at the vertically challenged man being unable to escape the apartment after a particularly brutal murder. It's a sad indictment that we've become so desensitised that this is deemed comedy.There is no humour to be found here. Nor any light. It's watchable to see the Phoenix tour de force but don't expect to feel like it's money well spent. The narrative is wooly and many good songs are now ruined by being in this soundtrack. Avoid."
"Regardless of whether you like it or hate it, I think the film explores how the Joker is the way he is because he can't be otherwise, literally. One of the greatest dangers to America itself is American culture. It's not terrorism that will destroy America; it's American culture that will ultimately be the undoing of America. The film looks to examine our distorted points of view or detachments from reality and show us that WE, as a society, have the same characteristics of the Joker. The Joker is a product of this materialistic culture we live under. Epistemically western culture is motivated by striving for money, status and recognition, which is focused on results and efficiency but that can have severe consequences because you're always judging yourself with the person next to you.The movie Joker is what you get when you take American culture, and you take it to its pinnacle. When you exaggerate it to the extreme, you get someone like the Joker. But the critical hidden message is that we need to become more aware of our OWN double standards within ourselves. We need to start to empathize that we have the same mechanisms as the Joker has. So, on the one hand, I can criticize the Joker, but on the other side, I can also see why he acts the way he does, but more importantly see it collectively. Notice that trying to rid the world of evil only creates more evil. Everything you might criticize; corporate greed, different beliefs, religion, people you dislike, violence, war, mass shootings, even just hating this movie - We like to criticize things, but while we're criticizing, we're NOT really thinking about how we ourselves are part of the very same problem that is contributing to the cycle."
"There is nothing that makes this a movie about a super villain. He isn't a criminal mastermind and there is nothing in this movie to make it fantastical enough that you would believe Batman could exist.
That leaves a 2 hour film about a guy with mental health issues, delivered with a subtlety that would put Michael Bay to shame.
This film pounds you with its message or lack thereof like Batman smacking Joker's head off a desk.
Pitiful."
"Although this movie is competently made, it leaves me questioning the decisions they made about this character. I always thought that the Joker was interesting because of his mysterious origins and the chaos he generates. He's crazy but also very intelligent. This version of the Joker is delusional and pathetic.
The interesting aspect of the movie (for me) was the different point of view, the different perspective on Gotham's unrest and its cause. But Arthur doesn't consciously start a riot because he's fed up with the system, he just does it by accident and then, because everyone puts him on the spotlight, he just accepts his role.
But Joaquin Phoenix is great, he makes the movie worth watching."
"Crazy story, but not from DC Gotham city
This Joker is not amazing, not smart or creative. This Joker not for people, he is for Hoakine Phoenix, to show, he is fantastic drama. Don't show this movie to children"
"I'm blown away at the positive reviews... I went to this movie wanting to like it but found myself struggling to stay awake.What was it about?Sad, dark, nothingness. Blah. Boring, just boring."
"Everybody must have watched this movie with blinders on .it is not Oscar worthy ,boring as hell no dialogue or story to speak of .you cannot compare him to Heath Ledger or Jack Nicholson .His laugh is horrible.People are gullible spending money to see trash like the blairwitch project .I rated 1 star only cause couldn't do 0"
Well acted but entirely missed what the joker is. I was bored and found it lacking in anything of value. I have worked in mental health for many years and found this to be a poor choice of paths to take someone down. I found little empathy and even less point to this film. Joaquin Phoenix was brilliantly my score in no way reflects his acting he was simply awesome. If you liked Heath Ledger's portrayal then you will probably also enjoy this movie. This by itself and aside from the DC universe was a pretty good movie as a joker movie it was boring. I almost never give 1 star reviews but this one I could have not watched and been much happier.
"My immediate reaction coming out of the cinema was that the film would be better suited as a play. This being because in the film there are only really four main settings: the apartment, the city, the subway, and the comedy club/theatre/television studio. Especially with the last setting(s) I mentioned, as a play the various reactions of a live audience could add realism and also an active reciprocal interaction between Arthur and an audience which I think would be more entertaining.I agree with my friend's opinion of the film, for which he believed the range of issues covered was ""as wide as a sea but as deep as a pond"". The main issues such as mental health, misogyny, class, politics, and parental relations (as well as many others) were all raised and recognised as issues but were not explored in any depth, again as my friend put beautifully he believed Phillips was ""tickboxing"" issues that are meaningful to current audiences.When Arthur is sitting alone at the back of the bus, the CGI outside the back window is horrendous. There is also a weird camera shake when Arthur climbs into the fridge, which from the angle makes you think this is from a first-person perspective of an unknown person in Arthur's flat, but then there is a cut and on reflection seems bizarre. Clearly Phillips ran out of budget and had to film on a potato.The musical score was excellent until it was muddled with contemporary music (for example when Arthur dances down the concrete steps) which was a jarring and incongruent.On a more positive note, Phoenix's Joker was original and superbly acted. Arthur having a condition making him laugh creepily and inappropriately was an authentic and believable aspect of his character. Phoenix is very effective at laughing with dead and soulless eyes, making him seem utterly sinister.Similar to Hamlet, The Joker can be played in many different ways because of the ambiguous complexity of his character. Phoenix's Joker is a victim of the worst aspects of society, fragile, and deeply forlorn. This being a very different interpretation to the assertive and more dominant representations in Leto's or Ledger's performances.All in all, a good watch but please someone adapt it into a play!PS: I want that suit."
"Im not sure whether I enjoyed the movie, but it left me with themes to think. Whether everything happened as a delusion or in reality,is a question. The actor's talent is best reflected through character. But its hard to justify giving death as punishment. Still a lot more to think about even after finishing watching movie."
"The depth to which Joaquin Pheonix plays Joker is actually disturbing. This Joker is so very different than the gold standard Heath Ledger. In Heath's Joker, we feel unpredictable and scared or terrified, but Joaquin potrays a Joker which isn't as terrifying but it's downright eerie, disturbing and unnerving. It makes you sympathize with Joker, the most despicable character in comic universe, and makes you wanna help him. It doesn't make you justify Joker's choices but it will make you understand them, and by the end you will want to justify Arthur's actions, not Joker's but Arthur's. You wouldn't be able to justify them but you will have a hard time to condemn them. Also the story leaves you at an uncertain point open to any interpretation, just like the charachter and the comics it has drew inspiration from. It is a mind boggling, thorough, disturbing and unnerving charachter study that makes you question not only society but yourself too."
"This movie is a masterpiece! It absolutely epitomizes what a DC movie should be. Dark, emotional, thought provoking, not just some mindless over the top action. One of the best movies I've seen in a long time. Joaquin Phoenix is surely grabbing an Oscar for this one! What a performance, what a movie."
"I am reluctant to see ""superhero"" movies. I this case, I would see it again and again. Joaquin Phoenix is just an Oscar winner actor."
"Review:
'Joker' is an American psychological-thriller film directed by Todd Phillips. Being one of my most anticipated movies of the year as well as a movie I never wanted to be made, I was feeling so many different emotions on my way to the theatre to see this film. I needed time to think about it and process what I had just seen because the movie is very dark and heavy, and after doing so I believe this is my favorite film to come out of 2019.
The movie follows the character of Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) who is working as a clown-for-hire while living with and caring for his mother, Penny (Frances Conroy) in Gotham City. We see Arthur get beaten down by society both literally and figuratively, from being jumped in an alley to being fired from his job and being called crazy and useless. Slowly over time, he starts thinking his life is a comedy and transforms into the clown he has been portraying for years.
If Joaquin Phoenix doesn't at least get an Oscar nomination for his portrayal in this movie I will be both surprised and disappointed. What he did to prepare for this role was incredible and he brought everything to every scene he was in. Everybody in this movie fit their roles perfectly, but other than Joaquin Phoenix another standout performance for me has to be Robert De Niro. He wasn't in the film a whole lot, but I really believed he could have been a Talk-Show Host. He didn't phone it in at all and really committed which I appreciated.
I really can't talk about what I liked in this movie without going into spoiler territory. However, I will say that the movie needed to be Rated-R and I'm so happy Todd Phillips pushed the Studio into letting that happen. There were certain scenes that I could tell if they tried to do the same thing in a PG-13 film, it wouldn't have worked. They were also very smart in showing Arthur slowly progress into the Joker we know and it didn't just all happen at once, he hated his life in the beginning and dragged his feet when he walked, and by the end he is carrying himself with confidence.
Overall, I really can't say a lot about this movie beside I loved it! I beg for everybody to go and see this movie in theatres, movies like this deserve to make money so original films like this can be made. Yes, even though this is based off a 'Batman' character, it is still a very original story and I highly recommend.
5/5"
"Non apologitic , in your face kind of revolutionary evolution of the Joker character . Deeply visceral violence that only contribute to the story and don't develope without reason ."
Was this suppose to be entertainment? What a waste. Can't believe so many idiots think this is quality entertainment. Must be a bunch of Antifa socialists.
This movie is stunning. Joaquin Phoenix performance as the Joker is one of the greatest of all time. Combine with an amazing script and Joaquin Phoenix's amazing performance give us a character driven film that is one of the best movies ever made.
"OK, the story is nice and the acting is excellent. But the movie suffers from three bad things:1- Boring and uninteresting dialog. There are a lot of them.2- Too slow pace.3- Too lengthy. Too much time for very little number of ideas.These three things combined are more than enough to destroy any movie. It is the first time I have felt that I need to look at the watch to know how much left for the movie to end. Beside this, the genre is supposed to be a thriller in addition to crime and drama, but it is too far from being a thriller.I cannot understand the exaggerated high ratings for this movie. I want to be fair with it. So although it is boring, I give it 4 stars for the story and the acting, but definitely the movie does not worth 5 stars or more. Consequently, I cannot recommend this movie."
"I'll sum it up
The role of joker is something to live up to with great actors before
Joaquin Phoenix puts up a great performance
His laugh as well is great
Everything is great"
"Bleak, rarely entertaining, unoriginal, didn't know what it wanted to be. Was it all a dream in the end? When the lights came on in the cinema you could sense the disappointment in the audience. Stony silence. Wish I trusted my gut and didn't go. Just re-watch Heath Ledger's Joker again, honestly. At least it tries to balance art with entertainment, and doesn't just sink into the depths of pretentiousness. Phoenix does his best, but between this and: You were never really here, he needs to lighten it up a bit. Commodus in Gladiator was more interesting and well rounded."
"Joaquin Phoenix' performance: ARest of the movie as a whole: DTotal: CSome will love it, some will hate it. I'm somewhere in the middle."
"Is whatever you want it to be. If you want to hate it, you'll hate it. If you want to love it, you'll love it. Be optimistic."
"It's just a bad movie. It is slow, boring and disturbing."
"I've seen the word ""masterpiece"" attached to many, many reviews, so much so that I can't help but wonder if there's a coordinated effort. If so, this review is not part of that effort.Let's get into it - Joaquin Phoenix does a really good job in this role, especially when in his Joker costume - there were times when he seemed to be channeling Heath Ledger. Although, I have to confess that without his Joker makeup, his face reminded me of Ty Burrell, who plays Phil Dunphy on Modern Family - they really look similar to me. And since Phil Dunphy is such a harmless character, it sort of took me out of the moment. Regardless, Joaquin did a great job.Now, the story? Well, that was a little less impressive to me. I've heard people say that the Joker was an unreliable narrator, which is true, but I don't know if that necessarily makes this a better movie. I think the movie is definitely a showcase of a character with mental illness, which makes me think of Heath Ledger's line: ""Why so serious?""Also, I learned afterward that this movie is disconnected from the overall D.C. cinematic universe, which I find odd. I mean, it's a fairly decent portrayal of the Joker, so why put it in its own little bubble universe? To my mind, that basically makes this movie a glorified fan fiction, and again, begs the question, ""why?""Anyway, I think the movie is worth seeing, as much of it is well done. However, it's not one that I feel any urge to rewatch. My two cents."
Great. Awesome performance . Directing perfect acting from all actors perfect but the movie over all is not that much of thriller or idont know may be i wanted more but it really needed more.
"Great film and didn't get bored!I'd been told not much happened but couldn't take my eyes off the screen..Went pretty dark at times but I think it needed to, a fantastic performance from Joaquin & Bob!Go see it people.."
"The ultimate goal of the film is to make you uncomfortable. Does it succeed? It really does. This movie isn't for everyone, but it's a very unique and well-done film with top notch acting."
"This movie constructs itself in a very slow pace but in an extremely gratifying way, every action that is shown deteriors Arthur's sanity, making us feel not pity but discomfort and disgust with everything around us but fading away with joy and calmness as the movie reachs the climax in a rush, the signs of anxiety and madness in Arthur constantly increases and breaks through the audience flawlessly. A great rollercoaster of emotions that most of the people will feel identified with."
"Joker is a drama movie in the vein of movies like Taxi-Driver and King of Comedy, It is a horror movie without any jump-scares or any other horror movie tropes and it is a comic-book origin movie about the most notorious and iconic villain. This movie will make you uncomfortable very often but ultimately it will force upon you some difficult questions that most movies shy away from asking. This is one of the few comic-book movies which will force you to think for hours after you have seen it.Joker is a movie about Arthur Fleck (played brilliantly by ""Joaquin Phoneix"") who had some psychopathic tendencies but due to deteriorating conditions of Gotham and certain events that took place in the span of the movie leads him to lose it completely and become the villain we all know as Joker. The movie in its 2-hour runtime focuses completely on Arthur Fleck and shows his descent into becoming the joker and that journey is very well showcased, sometimes it is so realistic that some might consider it almost horror-like. The main credit goes to Joaquin Phoneix for such brilliant acting definitely Oscar-worthy, he is the main reason that the journey is believable you may feel bad for the character but you will also be able to feel the darkness deep inside which endorse his actions, the darkness which is slowly unravelled throughout the span of the movie. The rest of the supporting casts were great as well especially Robert De Niro.The movie is directed by Todd Philips who before this had only directed movies like Hangover and Due date. This movie was a great departure from his usual type of movies but he pulled it off, you could tell he is a big Scorsese fan as this movie is heavily inspired by Taxi Driver. Like Taxi Driver this movie is a bit of a slow burner and slowly picks up the pace which really helps in understanding the character a lot better especially since this movie was a character study. As the descent into madness started so does the pacing of the movie.The cinematography was very beautiful, the tone of the movie really helped in showcasing the deteriorating Gotham and characters. The soundtrack of the movie was also very good again I think it was very similar to Taxi Driver, It wasn't omnipresent, though when played it increased the tension very easily.I am really glad that a movie like this exists. When comic-book movies are so saturated it is important that we have directors and actors who take risks like these. Projects like these (if successful) could break the monotony that has shrouded the comic-book genre. You may not end up liking the movie but that should not stop you from recognising it for its uniqueness and its bold take. Having said that I really loved this movie to bits and would love to see it again and again for its mesmerising performances, beautiful cinematography, lovely score and especially for its unique take."
"Joker is an escape into a sociopathic dark drama produced as an independent film with a big budget cast. Todd Phillips wrote , produced and directed this cinematic catastrophe. Phoenix was brilliant in the portrayal of a broken-hearted villain, he simply read the script he was paid for. The concern returns to Todd Phillips. His filmography includes a variety of B movie comedies, Old School & Hangover being his claim to fame. Joker is not a comedy or an action throwback to the DC comics. Joker is a dismal depressing depiction from a director who is obviously illustrating his own internal darkness."
Amazing the movie was great and they could've of done it any better Joaquin is the best actor and I enjoyed him as the joker and Todd Philips performance was really good at setting this movie out to be the best thing I have saw in a long time and I think he is the best joker in my opinion
I'm sure lots of people worked really hard on this film. I found it slow and boring to say the least. The acting was great but the story didn't hold my attention.
"Huge disappointment. Another way over hyped release from Hollywood. Actors acting crazy isn't hard for them. While a lot of people give Joaquin Phoenix huge rave reviews, looking at the performance with a deeper critical view reveals just a deeper level of crazy. You'd have to pay me to watch this one again. Story line was also very weak and the movie puts all of its eggs into the one basket of Joaquin Phoenix. Hollywood continues to try to outdo the previous versions of a character that by now is long worn out."
"The only reason I hung in to the end of this movie is that I was sure there had to be some point to all of this...and there was but more to make a lasting impression of a political statement than to be entertaining.If you find Frankenstein, Dracula and Friday the 13th films entertaining, you'll love this...otherwise, it's a good make-out movie.... One you won't miss having seen."
"I thought this movie was complete and utter garbage. I don't understand why people liked this movie so much. The character doesn't even stay true to the comics and the director flat out said it didn't, and then they made it seem like it was part of Gothams fall and he was just a little boy that had a laughing problem... Hated it"
"If you like Movies with Zero Story and 2 Hours of bla bla nonsense, this is for you!This was by far the most boring Movie of 2019. An yeah, normally i Like the Joker, but what was that?
Sure i understand the Story about isolation and the Psychological Side.
But what makes this a Movie so special that it deserves a 8.8 Score?
Because of the Laughs from Joker? Because he shots some People?The Acting, sure was top notch, and the cinematography was wonderful.
But aside that, we have nothing remarkable. Only the Joker had a Character developement. All other Characters are boring sterotypes with not a single sidestory.3 Stars because of Acting and Cinematography... Nothing more."
"The Joker turned out to be one of the best movies I have ever seen. Joaquin is so believable, so real, so present that I honestly felt uncomfortable: like watching the movie was like intruding on someones private life. This felt a lot more like a documentary than anything else. so raw. so devastating and sad. I felt his pain and outrage pour out through the screen: it was easy to empathise with him and his suffering. If Joaquin does not get an oscar for this I will be outraged."
"I enjoyed the movie it has a grittiness and indeed the acting is top notch. My problem is the story. Though the story of how the Joker becomes the Joker it doesn't do much else. I would expect the story to contain something more, some great lines, memorable moments something to keep the tension heightened but it doesn't. Yes it's well acted, and one of my friends tried comparing it to Taxi Driver but coming out of the movie I asked him to provide me one memorable quote/line and he couldn't (I can provide you several for Taxi Driver that I watched over 20 years ago). So yeah it's a good movie and worth seeing but don't expect a lot to happen, and definitely it's no masterpiece. I gave it a solid 7."
"A masterpiece! Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) is a pathetic loser in Gotham's fractured society circa early 1980s. By day a clown-for-hire and by night an aspiring stand-up comic Being a successful comedian he could better care for his sick elderly mother living in a rundown apartment. Arthur has a neurological malady that has him breaking out in screeching laughter at inopportune situations. Suffering humiliation and raw despair, his comedy is flat and tends to lead to violence. When the dysfunctional comic gets his hands on a gun discovers what talent he possess is not for comedy. One bad decision after another brings Fleck to the center of a chain reaction of chaos giving a new origin myth of Batman's notable supervillain opponent...The Joker!.Phoenix's performance is pure brilliance. Also featured are: Robert De Niro, Zazie Beetz, Bill Camp, Shea Willingham, Frances Conroy and Brett Cullen."
"I had to create an account to write a review because I never write reviews but this movie just forced me to.The character development, the story, the acting, bigger picture. All put in beautifully that any viewer can follow and understand. Joaquin puts on a performance of the century. You can feel all character's emotions in this movie and suddenly forget you are watching a categorized ""villain"". This is way more than a superhero flick. This a deep psychological fictional tale of how someone or anyone can radically transform because of their circumstances and how society treats them.Don't expect so much action. The action is in the character. No useless unnecessary scenes. No CGI. No childish cliche flicks and stunts. This is as raw and real as it gets and has an epic ending.If Joaquin Phoenix doesn't get an Oscar, then the Oscars are rigged. I know there are more movies to come but no move will revolve around a single character transforming and changing in this way.Screw the critics...they judge on their own. You are part of the overwhelming majority of the population. Watch it with a clear and sober head and you will not be disappointed.
I didn't give it a 10 because that's just me. I don't believe in perfection. I'm just giving it a 9 in case I see something better in the future but it's a 10 in my at the moment."
"Masterpiece? No.
Great? No.
Good? Barely.Sure the acting was good, but it was overshadowed by the drudgery. I kept saying to myself, ""get to the point"". Does the director think I'm stupid? I get it, he is insane. But they forgot that not only is the Joker insane, he is freaking brilliant.How can it be a masterpiece if the movie misses the centerpiece??Finally, the movie is way too long and plods along so slowly repeating the same note without creating a symphony.Hopefully the fan edit will dwindle this down to it's essence while providing some depth. At almost 2 hours, the movie creates an atmosphere of overindulgence of self-aggrandizing without substance.One last point, the the sheer amount of 10 rated reviews prior to this movie's release is indicative of the shenanigans of the movie industry and reflective of American business. Just shameful."
"Impressive technical aspects, performance, score in service of a predictable, pretentious, although good scriptI'll watch it again so as to better understand it though..which is a thing that i honestly won't say about any of the previous mcu or dceu movie(ITS DEFINITELY DELICIOUSLY COMPLEX & DEEP IN PARTS)The movie is almost too much reliant upon Phoenix's performance as joker, if you look at it from a pure prospective of script/story, you'll definitely find it to be underwhelming(CHARACTER DRIVEN NARRATIVE, LEAD PERFORMANCE TAKES CENTRE STAGE OVER STORY)It talks about mental health in a way that i haven't previously seen in any movie,that being said it doesn't bring anything new to the table & do things that have been previously done better in movies like taxi driver & the king of comedy(SOMEWHAT LACKS ORIGINALITY, TOO MUCH INSPIRED FROM THESE MOVIES)As far as the character of joker is concerned..it's definitely not something you're familiar with and movie doesn't seem to care to show much about his character development as joker who would face off against Batman in the future.. I.e
An formidable opponent of Batman in terms of intellect & physical strength(NOT A COMIC ACCURATE JOKER,WHICH CAN BE A CRITICISM OR NOT,DEPENDS UPON YOUR PROSPECTIVE)It may seem like I'm being too harsh in this review, but i also believe that it's one of the most important movie of our times, & also hope that it'll gives studios like Disney & sony to grow balls & give us R rated movies of characters like Deadpool,logan & venom so as tho give their comic book counterparts proper justice"
"It's a really good film that conveys a relevant message. But it plays fast and loose with ""show don't tell"" while bridging the gap between one part of the story and the next. You might find yourself asking ""wait... how did things blow out of proportion so quickly?"" in regards to the world around Joker, and not really finding much of an answer beyond a couple of off-hand explanations."
"People were expecting this movie and this joker to be just like The Dark Knight, but how can it be when they're showing his journey from the beginning, and realistically speaking, how can a normal man with no history of violence can do what the Joker from dark knight did? I'm in love with the new storyline, and how society and some mental illnesses made him what he is, the whole movie makes so much sense. if the Joker is a real person in this world that would be the how he turned into Joker, that what makes it a 10/10, + the effects, the cinematography and how dark the violence is, and in my opinion without overhyping it, i consider it the movie of the decade."
Great great movie! Will have you thinking about it for days after you've seen it. So much space for thinking. Phenomenal acting
Joaquin Phoenix preformed one of the best characters I've ever seen
"Hopefully a remedy to an increasingly soulless industry, although it's attempt to personify our societal issues will be sure to leave you feeling hapless and empty. What critics don't seem to accept is the value in a movie not leaving you skipping out of the theatre, it seems addressing modern issues head-on has become far too 'problematic' for our film commissars these days. If you'd rather bury your head in the sand, Disney is always waiting with another reincarnation of whatever the money people conjure up next."
"In a time with an extreme amount of flashy superhero movies, this movie sets out to be an example of a more realistic touch to the genre."
Joker is an original movie that may be slow for some people who cant sit patiently as you are rewarded with dramatic tension. I really do time my rest room breaks appropriately but it had me so focused I held it and ran out of my refreshments not to miss a detail. Yes I'll see it again and yes I'll buy it when it comes out. This is creatively told and shown in a rather clever way and allows you to forget that this man used to be Johnny Cash. Amazing performance!!!
"First of all, the message in this film is great especially with what's going on in the world. Everybody who goes to see this movie will probably walk away thinking the exact same thing and know what the message is. At this point I think it's pretty obvious what everybody already knows and I'm just going to put in my five cents and that's Joaquin Phoenix is amazing as Arthur Fleck/Joker and he definitely deserves an Oscar nomination for his role. He went all-in with this character showing the different stages in his life and making everybody feel bad for him. At certain points in the film, I felt really bad for the guy and wanted to help him out because nobody deserves to be treated that way. It also helps that he didn't start out as wanting to become the Joker but society just helped turn him into him. Robert De Niro, who plays Murray Franklin, probably won't get an Oscar nomination for supporting actor but he still did a standout job with his character. Another thing that stood out to me was the cinematography of the movie and how it helped show Arthur's slow descent into madness and how he views the world. I feel like some people are waiting for me to hate on the pacing of this film and honestly, I had no problem with it at all. If the movie was any longer it would have felt like it was dragging on and any shorter and they would have rushed the Joker transformation. But with that in mind, this film is like most people have said already and that's a character story. So, if you don't want to watch a story about a man who's driven to his breaking point and wants to see an action superhero then stay home and watch The Dark Knight. I love how the costume was different from any Joker suit we've seen before, though it's hard to replicate without buying a store-bought costume. The music by Hildur Guonadottir was amazing. In the end, this movie is an amazing character story with an important message. I give Joker a 10/10."
Ignore the bitter Batman loving weirdos who give this a 1/10. It's brilliant on all levels.
"I just saw the movie in a small town here in france called le mans. What a masterpiece. this is what I need to see in DC. Dark, violent and well written script.Phoenix was awesome. He delivered a great performance. the man putted a small on my face.thanks Todd for the movie. thak WW, and of course thank you DC"
"This film is something else, being a DC fan all my life, I'm certainly glad to see a different take on The Joker. Joaquin Phoenix is potentially one of the best Jokers now. His laugh is spot on and certainly goes beyond many others. Joaquin's overall performance is powerful and one of best in recent years. Todd Phillip's vision for a gritty non-comic based Joker film really sheds light on the problems Gotham's society. Which can easily portray a number of the problems in our actual society. Things such as lack of funding for mental health, rude and terrible people who only want to bring others down, and simply crime. Many people are scaring audiences about and there's no need to be afraid, this movie is potentially the most realistic take on a comic book Super Villain yet."
"I can't express this is in words, this movie is an experience, you yourself need to experience it. Character build up is out of imagination, acting skills out of this world, over all this movie is a gem."
"This film is raw, dark, and honest. You never quite feel empathy for Arthur, but you do sometimes find a bit of sympathy for him never crossing the line into being ok with him. From the very first 1 minute he is awkward, creepy and clearly on edge. You're always uncomfortable.The build up is fantastic, and each part of the story was a major factor in the finale.EPIC"
"Incredible movie, unbelievable acting, a masterpiece!"
"This movie is a precious jewel in the entire history. No one could ever make a movie like this, the character development, Joaquin's acting, every damn second of this movie is overwhelming. This movie is legendary, honestly I don't think anyone could ever make a better movie. Again, Every damn second of this movie is worth it."
"Disturbing, painful, sick, Joaquin Phoenix was crazy"
The darkest movie of the decade with stunning edge of the seat thrilling performance by Phoenix. How the society pushes Arthur to insanity and the character transformation is something to watch out for. Brilliantly made. This movie deserves an Oscar.
"Dear movie freaks, Joker is the most anticipated movie that we have been expecting since the first month of year 2019 and yes this is a very good dramatic movie. I said dramatic because Joker delivers us the ideas on how Arthur Fleck character can be Joker, right when we totally forgot about Batman appearance. We don't care about Batman here. We care about a joker, a comedian, a broken child, and a really sad story of a man who sacrifices everything to be happy, yet we never really understand what is going on his mind and heart, until we saw the killings and the blood and we blame him as a villain. I really salute the Director, the make up team, editor, cinematographer, scriptwriter, and Joacquin Phoenix acting, wow he could win Oscar for this movie. This movie has few actions, but a lot of tears and drama and how we can reflect to ourselves, are we really happy or just a made-up-happy just to make our life comfortable....2 hours are not enough to understand Joker but I really love the ending that you can't watch without clapping your hands. A Masterpiece!"
"The joker is easily the greatest super villains of all time, so a movie focusing solely on this character was either a hit or miss, but a miss it is definitely not.Joker is one of those films which leaves an impactful mark on the viewers.Making full use of the available source material, the film, at the same time feels original and adds a certain amount of depth to it which is brought forward by classic and unpredictable storytelling.Phoenix's portrayal of the uprising crown prince of crime was exceptional in its own right, and is Oscar-worthy without any doubt. In addition, the direction, the writing, the cinematography, the music, the supporting performances were all very impressive.Verdict : Living up to the hype, this super villain origin story digs deep into the joker's descent into madness, perfectly showcased by a strong leading performance and powerful writing and directing."
"This is not a popcorn flick, very difficult to re-watch and a must-watch for all the Joker fans of the world. I'm a fan of Mark Hamill, Jack Nicholson, Heath Ledger, the Arkham games joker, the numerous comic book stories and the Gotham TV series joker and this one definitely deserves to be one of the best takes on the deranged clown. I heard that the weight loss took a toll on Joaquin's health, I hope he recovers as soon as possible. Regarding whether or not he deserves an Oscar, I don't think you need an Oscar to really brand an artist on how good they are if that were the case, Christopher Nolan, Will Smith, and Robert Downey Jr. would have a bunch of them. Nevertheless, I do hope he gets nominated.I was wrong in saying that WB doesn't know how to use the DC villains after witnessing that performance from Jesse Eisenberg as Luthor and the wasted opportunity to make Jared Leto the main villain in suicide squad. They just need to find the right directors and excellent writers that these characters demand. Well done Todd Phillips, Joaquin Phoenix and the rest of the cast for giving us something so fresh, not everything has to be a part of a universe and lead to bigger battles, maybe that's the reason the film turned out so well because it was under no such extra pressure. Maybe WB can learn from this and focus on making now movies like this because we've had enough popcorn flicks and team-ups and it's not always about the box office money, it's about sending a message.After witnessing 23 Marvel movies and DCEU's desperate attempt to keep up with the MCU and it's constant but pointless protest that 'They're different than Marvel', Joker was a bit of fresh air that I needed and all the comic book fans in the world deserve. Maybe the writing in this movie was as good as I think it is or maybe game of thrones season 8 lowered the bar because anything other than 'I don't want it' and 'She's my queen' made me want to applaud the writers."
"There where certain negative critic reviews online about the movie but I found them to be completely unfair.
A random superhero movie no2: protsgonist/proragonists kill 10.000 People and no one bats an eye.
Joker: kills 5 People and everyone loses their minds.
After all, It is a movie telling the story of an 'antihero', the super villain taken from DC's universe comics and it should be viewed and reviewed as that.It is refreshing to see a different approach on superhero movies, far from the same old recipe of their kind. It has very well-rounded screenplay(well, mostly), stunning photography and directing and the protagonist clearly manages to be a persuasive 'Joker' in his own unique way. Overall, I am hapilly surprised by this movie and enjoyed it very, very much."
Had a lot of expectations after the iconic joker from Heath ledger and Joaquin just met all our expectation.must watch for all
"This is the only movie that I felt giving 10/10 is justice. This movie is so original in every inch and have pushed the boundary of cinema much further. It's perfectly written, be it the script, the music score, the screenplay, the pacing, everything is very masterful. And by the end you'll be really convinced as how the Joker came to be how we know he is. This movie made the story of Batman that we know and love made so much more sense that you'll finally feel complete. I'm looking forward for the Batman movie. With Rob Pattinson cast as Batman, I'm optimistic it's a perfect role for him as how Jacquin Phoenix is the perfect one to play the Joker. Before, you'd think The Dark Knight is a dark story, and Heath Ledger (R.I.P.) is the perfect actor to play the Joker. You'll change your mind. Hats off to you Jacquin. Don't matter what the critique or interviewer say. You and everyone involved in creating this movie has shaked the cinematic world. This movie made the whole Marvel expanded cinematic universe look like they were made by amateurs. So step aside Marvel. DC is coming to reclaim the crown."
"Marvellous,ecstatic,stunning,terrifying!
This teaches how a life goes on in a toxic society.
Atlast the oscar deserves joaquin Phoenix,what a performer."
"Perfect story line, perfect cinematography, perfect sound, everything is perfect. I'm lost for words."
With enough substance to rival an entire cinematic universe!This perfect balance of real world grit and comic book lore might make you stay back to watch the end credits just to appreciate the team that put this gem together.And that's because this is not a franchise. This is cinema.There is no merchandising greed on display. Just love for characters that have been part of our lives for most of our lives.Joker restores the much needed respect to the pure art of storytelling that lies within the pages of many a comic book.Something that was being covered under layer after layer of sfx and pandering in almost every release since the dark knight.Todd Phillips and Joaquin Phoenix take it away.And take it away in style.
"JP is an undeniably intense actor who certainly puts his soul into what he does. Everything from the honored actor is well-made as a work of art. But now the movie is not called JP but the Joker and that is where the fun ends. A movie cannot start and end with a solo performance if everything is empty around. It is truly a totally entertaining film that lacks momentum altogether. It also deviates so much from the original that I would like to say that it is no longer a DC movie, but instead a film about a seriously ill person who only feels compassion for himself. No, even though I bought the ticket, I don't buy the movie concept."
This was the best movie of 2019 a TRUE must watch so much better than Endgame even better than the dark knight trilogy best movie of 2019!!!!
"I am writing this review in the interval while I am watching the movie. The first half is a sheer torture to watch. This movie is so, so boring. I'm cursing myself for deciding to watch this. Horrible!"
"Let me start with my summary.. ""Mehhh"".Why on earth this movie had to be in the DC universe I have no idea. A criminal mastermind Joaquin Phoenix's joker will never be. As a social commentary on mental illness it might have worked. But this guy is not the joker, nor is there anyway he could become the joker. He is just too sad of a character.The tacked on violence at the end seemed like something put there as a crowd pleaser for all the people that was expecting something related to Batman. Ohh naturally they had to put in the killing of Batmans parents. I mean that way we know it has something to do with the joker right?We were three guys in our mid thirties and we were all thoroughly bored. Well acted but not interesting."
"There is no doubt in my mind that Joaquin Phoenix deserves at least an Oscar nod, if not the trophy itself. In an odd way, he reminded me of Sean Penn in that when you watch him, you forget he is an actor, all you see is the character. In reality, the rest of the cast were merely props in this one-man show... even Robert De Niro.There are a lot of Easter Eggs as nods to other films of the late 70s and early 80s, which was cool.As an origin story in the comic book universe, Joker was good, better than most. I do not judge movies based on how closely they follow a book or if they follow the rules of physics, but more if they entertain me and allow me to escape my reality for a few hours. In that sense, Joker left me wanting for more. Yeah, there are political nods that you can read into this, but they weren't forced onto the viewer, more of a backdrop.The randomness of Joker's thinking and thoughts was in a word, distracting. Because the director put me in the lead character's psychosis, I had a hard time sympathizing with any character in the movie, which makes it difficult to connect to the story.Maybe the real genius of the movie was that randomness, seeing the world through the psychotic mind of the Joker. But it didn't make for a hugely entertaining experience for me."
"Rating 4.5/10
I just buy ticket from PREMIUM HALL to see this movie because previously i saw a good reviews from IMDB. The previews of this movie make you want to see it, but it wasn't nearly as good as i expected it to be. The character of Joaquin Phoenix who is obviously suffering from mental illness is really bad and annoying !! I truly do not understand the high rating on this film. Very disappointing."
The BEST.Absolute masterpiece. Every award ceremony should recognize this film and Pheonix You are GOD.
"I am not surprised . Public routinely overreact to fresh titles. In the future, it will get what it deserves, 6-7 at most."
I....I just can't believe..This movie is beyond good. It's same quality as Christopher Nolan movies. I love the every second of them. Every person needs to watch this movie.
Don't understand what's so entertaining about this. This is one sick depressing dark film. this is like using art to trigger murders. Absolute sick movie! Agenda is clear..!
Acting is good.. quality of the movie is good.. but watching someone mentally unstable for 2hrs nty..
"This movie makes him out to be a nervous child with pseudobulbar affect (pathological laughter). I understand what the movie is trying to point out, but it would have worked for me if it was not connected to the joker or dc comics. The Joker is a brilliant and ruthless criminal mastermind, so much of a genius Batman is the only one who can match him. This ""origin"" story does not create a Joker that could ever hope to be Batman's greatest enemy. He causes mass chaos in the city by mistake. A very slow burn for a very weak payoff, the ending should have been in the middle of the movie and gone from there. His makeup is that of a clown the entire movie never bearing any resemblance to any Joker i've ever seen. I can't enjoy a character who is ONLY a mental case, he is terrible at being funny, Heath Ledger's joker was hilarious without trying to be a comedian, he was funny in the moment, this Joker is too disturbed for comedy. A character like the Joker doesn't need an origin story it should be left shrouded in mystery. Joaquin Phoenix did a great job with what it all was, but it felt more like Taxi than anything else which to some is a success but I feel it's a failure in this case."
I don't get why this movie is so popular I had to stop watching after 30 minutes of him laughing and dancing every 5 minutes. I started hoping Batman would show up just so he would punch him in the throat and put him in a wheelchair.
"Sorry but I did not like this movie.
I like drama but this was boring for me and too dark. Especially since this is fictitious town from a comic book and also a fictitious comic book character. It did not feel like a story about a real life person but just all made up for entertainment sake.
And the Joker not getting fired straight away for all his misconducts and inability to really make jokes was not believable. Especially after he took that gun to the hospital, in the real world who would have gotten fired instantly and reported to the police for illegal possession.
The talk show host was not really convincing either (I like Robert de Niro but this was not his best...) in regards to inviting him to the show. He actually thought he was a bad comedian so why invite him? To make fun out of him?
If I wanted to see a movie about a psychopath I would have wanted it to look more realistic and not have comic book character and half real life.
I have the feeling that some people watch the Marvel stories so much that they think the characters are real."
"I really have no idea why this film gets this kind of hype and rating. Coming in I was excited to see what was all the hype about but I left in despair and asking myself what's wrong with me for not liking this movie? Has it become a norm that everything that feels a little different automatically means we have an oscar on our hands? JP definitely deserves all the praise he's getting but I can't shake the feeling that it was all tried too hard to make it look way too serious and different while the plot didn't at all get the same treatment. I'm sorry, but this film doesn't live up to its expectations, it really doesn't."
It is so cringe to see people saying this movie is a masterpiece. It was so horribly depressing and twisted I can't believe people find it entertaining. Terrible film.
"I have to admit I have a short attention span however I could not even look away for a second during this movie.It's so hard to watch the pain Arthur is going through, battling with mental illness myself and seeing his journal in the beginning saying how people expect you to act like nothing is wrong hit home.This movie is not your average comic book, this is a deep though provoking drama.
Phoenix is INCREDIBLE"
"When I saw the magnificent Heath ledger a few years a go in his excellent role as a joker I doubted that any one can make such an amazing performance as Heath did .
Years after Heath tragic death 💔 that break our hearts Joaquin Phoenix bring the tears into our eyes again for this masterpiece , I can't really find the words to describe how Phoenix was great , the cinematography is absolutely amazing the music is outstanding,
I know that Phoenix is a great actor especially in his beautiful role in HER but actually in his new role as ajoker I think he put a new standard out there and I doubt that it will be some years before any one could reach it"
