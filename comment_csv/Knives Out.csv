"What an excellent film by Rian Johnson; definitely feels like the film he was destined to make. Writing that is slick as hell, sublime performances (most notably Daniel Craig who brings his A-game in a wonderfully charismatic turn), superb editing and wonderfully atmospheric music - all tied together by masterful direction. Will probably be among the most fun you have at a theatre this year and fans of Agatha Christie and old murder mystery stories will have plenty to love here - a nostalgically entertaining time!"
"Best movie of the year, love everything about it, what I'm seeing is that some trolls that still can't get over TLJ, now for those that have and give it a 1 well that's fair but have some reasons why, not just bc it's Rian Johnson, like stop it's childish"
"I enjoyed this a lot. Clever, interesting and plausible in its logic. I enjoyed the deception put forth by the characters. I can usually tell where something is going and was genuinely surprised by the hole in the hole of the donut.Some people might hate the politics of it, but I thought it gave a good dig at both sides while still being fairly liberal. FOX watchers will hate it, which I can see as kind of fueling the negative reviews.What can also fuel the negative reviews. is all the positive hype about it. Too much enthusiasm from the critics can hurt a movie sometimes. Viewers go into the theater expecting too much.Things never live up to the hype and this one didn't live up to it for me. But I thought it was still pretty solid and entertaining. I'm not sorry I spent some money on this one."
"As a fan of mysteries (Sherlock Holmes, Poirot, Columbo, Monk, Psych.etc.) I was thrilled to see someone making a classic style whodunnit...and the cast! Figure you can't go wrong. Well I enjoyed it & while the cast all have time to shine it is Daniel Craig with his Southern drawl & especially Ana de Armas that steal the show. For anyone keeping away because they hated The Last Jedi...I agree, it was my least favourite of all the Star Wars films, but this is a well written film that was well acted and I can only hope this will inspire others to reinvigorate the murder mystery genre."
"Knives Out (2019)
8/10🗡🚪💉💸""Rian Johnson successfully revives the ""whodunnit"" mystery subgenre with this perfectly cast fun time, even if it doesn't bring anything groundbreaking to the table.""Knives Out is the kind of ""whodunnit"" film that will never fail to entertain. As a progressive mystery, Knives Out is a very fashionable movie with it's grand ensemble of fresh and familiar faces. With some very snarky and slick writing, these characters are albeit memorable, most notably Daniel Craig's Detective Blanc and Chris Evan's Ransome, however, the film fails to make full use of the ensemble to the greatest extent. Of course that never takes away from what else Knives Out has to offer. The intensity of every moment that leaves you questioning the motive and action behind the titled crime scene is delivered with such glorious fashion, one could say Murder on the Orient Express had a beautiful baby, this being the result, showing Rian Johnson's strongholds. While the first two acts of the movie are quite strong and promising, the third act finds itself being a little rough around the edges but manages to find it's footing upon the conclusion; one for all and all for one.Verdict: Knives Out not only proves to us that Rian Johnson is a strong director with the right material, but also displays a fashionable reiteration of what the mystery genre can do to keep us guessing what is left in store for us to see in all the right ways."
"I actually wish  would do away with the star-rating portion of their website because it doesn't give an accurate rating for films and this film is a perfect example. Everyone knows that there are many bitter Star Wars fanboys rating this film low because they are still so bitter over Rian Johnson's The Last Jedi and as a result, they are going to try to ruin any of Rian's future films. They really need to just get over it and get a life, already. DON'T believe the Star-Rating of This Film Because It's Mostly from Bitter Star Wars Fanboys Rating the Film LOW ON PURPOSE!, obviously. Anyone who has actually seen this film would be brain-dead to rate it low or to not give it a good review because this film is so freaking entertaining! I could see it again and again. It's so different than the crap that has been in the theaters lately. It's fun, it's thrilling, it's wacky, it has so many twists and turns that it always keeps you guessing. And for the cast, what a freaking cast! I couldn't even tell you who the MVP of the cast was. They were all fantastic. We need more films like this and less big explosions, stupid plot films. I for one, will give this the true star-rating it deserves! 10/10!!!!! Bitter Star Wars fanboys, you can keep being immature and rating it low, but it isn't going to change the fact that the film is great and I'm going to encourage every single person to go out and see it pronto when it hits theaters!"
"I have read the many glowing reviews for this film and I honestly don't get it. Yes, there were some very funny and entertaining parts. It was a very good ensemble cast. Daneil Craig does his best Kevin Spacey as Frank Underwood impression. But beyond that, I found the cast woefully underused. Jamie Lee Curtis, Don Johnson etc. I expected Jamie Lee to play a major role but she seemed more like window dressing. She also, as the daughter, appeared to have no real motive for the murder. So the real crime here was her underuse. 1/2 of the members of the family had no motive mentioned. Then, when the ""murder"" was revealed at the half way point, it was clear Martha did not really do it and was being set up. Chris Evans conveniently shows up at the halfway point with lines, so the reveal, for the most part is painfuly obvious, or at least most of it. The give-aways were pretty obvious, like granny saying ""Random, you're back AGAIN"" or the comment on how the dogs barked only with certain people. The mention of the ""slayer"" law was very, very obvious. I understand this is a parody of the sleuth genre but shouldn't there be at least some surprises?Nor do I believe this is a ""commentary"" on our situation today. Yes, there was a dialogue thrown in on immigration but nothing new was covered here.That is not to say it is a bad film. Daniel Craig and the cast seemed to be having a ball. Lots of kooky things happened. But I think this is better for a late-nite Netflix watch.I certainly don't see it as being ""best of the year."""
Beautifully filmed and thought out very well which to me is good enough! Great ensemble cast that did excellent acting among adding hilarious parts in many scenes. Absolutely love Daniel Craig and Ana De Amas did awesome! I'm sure Knives Out has mixed opinions but I am very glad I got to see an early screening.
"Sometimes I am shocked when I see a great film...only to see it has an incredibly low overall score on IMDB. This is definitely the case with ""Knives Out""....a great film by writer/director Rian Johnson that I strongly recommend you see. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if this one receives some Oscar nominations...it's that good.""Knives Out"" is like an Agatha Christie novel set in modern day America and with American characters. But it's not just a homage to Christie-style films but a genuinely good and unique film in its own right. Kudos to many of the actors...particularly Daniel Craig. I thought Craig was miscast as a Southern American detective....but he carried it off wonderfully.Overall, I have no complaints...nothing I disliked or would do differently. In fact, it was so good I nearly gave it a 10....and I completely enjoyed the movie."
Mildly entertaining with a great cast and high production value. The story is soft but not awful. I can't imagine saying this film deserves more than a 6.
It's a fun whodunit movie with a great cast. It would make a great book too.
"""Knives Out"" is a perfectly entertaining, perfectly agreeable little film, a star-studded old-style murder-mystery that's good fun while it lasts. The actors involved all seem to be having fun and the plot keeps you engaged, even right up to the reveal when you will, as can often happen with these things, find yourself saying, ""Oh, so that's...hang on, that doesn't make any sense"". For indeed, plot and motivation holes abound and ultimately you're left with a decent film (although some might find the lie/reflux plot point a trifle irritating). It's fun enough, the kind of film best watched after Christmas lunch with the family, but it's not a game-changer in any way."
"What a waste of a stellar cast. The trailer shows almost all the scenes that the famous people are in together. The rest of the time you are watching a little known Cuban actress who is apparently the star of the movie. It's hard to believe that this is the same writer/director as Brick, which is one of my top 10 favorite movies. This movie doesn't have nearly as much sly humor as that movie. It's not particularly witty and it's not really a sendup of the genre, either. Not a complete waste of time, but not what I was hoping for either."
"Knives Out is a great whodunit that's unpredictable and extremely funny, skillfully playing with the tropes and conventions of a murder mystery. All of it's incredible cast are excellent but Chris Evans, Daniel Craig and Ana De Armas give the standout performances. Rian Johnson's direction is great and the film is extremely well filmed. The music by Nathan Johnson is fantastic. However, it's brought down slightly by the second act which can be tedious at times."
"After having seen all of Johnson's movies except for The Brothers Bloom I expected something a little bit more from Knives Out. A more mature, cold film with it's tounge in cheek is what I wanted after previously enjoying Brick and Looper so much. I was at least very happy to see it put a curious twist on the murder mystery genre. The story takes a very different path than I expected. Sadly, it seems as though they could have gone in harder with this twist, it goes back to the usual motions after a while.As it is this has to be Johnson's most accessible movie yet. It's a star-studded cast filled with old reliabales and also some newcomers. Though I don't feel as though the actors were given very much time to properly shine it's all very lovely and nice. The high saturation and crazy colorful sets should grab the interest of most viewers aswell, though I do find the cinematography quite formulaic.If you're looking for a nice family film you can take your children or parents to you're sure to have a blast. If you're looking for anything like Johnson's earlier work or something more artsy however, you'll be disappointed."
"I was so hyped for this movie after seeing the star studded cast and the rave reviews online. A movie with Daniel Craig, Chris Evans and Jamie Lee Curtis, I couldn't ask for more. However, the pacing is slow and the ""big twist"" is quite underwhelming. The jokes fall flat and aren't done well, I was expecting some great thrilling mystery and bust out laughing jokes but it sadly was a dud."
"UnderratedI disliked TLJ as a SW movie and particularly disliked some of the comments made by Rian Johnson; I therefore completely understand why people are annoyed with him. However giving fictional ratings to a completely different project is just childish.There is no way this movie is worth only one star, I give it 5 stars because the acting for the most part was decent and the overall story was fine, as was the cinematography, editing, directing, etc.OverratedThere is no way this movie is perfect and giving it a positive fictional rating is just as childish.To be honest, I became bored during the first half of the movie, the second half picked up somewhat. I expected more from the cast, none of them got me emotionally involved, I was happy enough to find out how it all played out but didn't find myself caring whether any of them did it or didn't do it or were ultimately 'good' or 'bad'.Red FlagI should know by now that when a trailer has to quote critics about how funny it is then it probably isn't. I laughed out loud once during the movie and was elsewhere amused literally only once or twice. I certainly did not get the humor that everyone 'talks' about.Go see it if you like this kind of movie and judge it on it's own merits...please."
"After seeing the trailer, the first thing you notice is the fantastic ensemble cast, but you might not expect this movie to be that comedic to be honest, more of a Thriller vibe. This movie decides to be a satire for the first 30mins, a silly comedy for the next 90mins and throws in some Thriller minutes for the fun of it, like playing Cluedo with Go-Stones, its a mess ad all over the place!This murder mystery ""reveals who the killer is"" halfway through the movie and still keeps on going, because it changes its premise after the first half, and now decides to be a different movie.All that being said... this movie is entertaining, for over 2 hours and reminds me how funny Daniel Craig can be. While the movie still suffers from the typical ensemble cast problems, it almost satirically plays with its own flaws and doesn't take itself to seriously.It's absolutely not a movie that you will remember in a few months, but its a light-harded comedy that will make you laugh a few times and that's what a comedy is about after all.I'm not sure if this is a movie you have to experience in the cinema, but it will be the perfect movie for a lazy rainy Sunday once it hits the streaming services!"
"Had potential, mildly entertaining but it lacked the witty tongue in cheek humour one expects from this type of film. Very slow, very flat and Daniel Craig's performance was cringeworthy, he just couldn't pull off the role and it seemed forced and unbelievable. I think all the reviews raving about how funny this film is are from people that haven't actually seen it. All round it was disappointing and lacking something."
"Gee, do I really need to watch a mystery movie to hear that immigrants are good and alt-right people are Nazis? Give me a break. Maybe writer/director Rian Johnson was trying to give some cultural context to the picture, but unfortunately the culture he is reflecting is his Kalifornia leftist echo chamber.
Aside from the distractive injection of immigration open borders advocacy, the film is a competent ensemble mystery comedy, easy on the comedy. In fact, if you aren't really looking for it, you may miss the humor, it is so innocuous and low-key, pretty much reflecting the state of comedy in America these days. Mustn't offend anybody with our humor, except of course rich white conservatives, who have no feelings, being pure evil.
The identity of the killer (who is of course rich and white) is kept well hidden for 95% of the running time, and for that, I give Knives Out 5 stars. It would have merited perhaps 7 stars, had Rian Johnson taken a few more chances in the comedy department, and withheld his dopey open immigration politics."
"A pretty bland whodunit that think's it's more intelligent than it is. A good whodunit needs a twist, or a surprise at the end, this had neither, the person you presume is the bad guy at the beginning is the bad guy at the end. In the films defence, the cast are all excellent"
"I love mystery stories. I adore Daniel Craig. The writer of this mess, not so much. Don't understand why it is so overrated. Ooohh, big surprise ending. By the time he gets around to it, don't much care. Why bother to make Craig assume the bad accent as it adds absolutely nothing to the plot or character. I've read so many better books, why not make movies out of them. Read Nesbo, see Headhunters. Now That has plot twists."
"Saw this at the festival circuit and was left completely unimpressed. An all star cast like this is usually a red flag for me that the story is going to be weak and I wasn't surprised. The Dialogue and characters are all super pretentious, and don't speak like real people so it's hard to care at all what happens. The twists feel cheap and unearned and sometimes it feels like things that are setup are never paid off in satisfying ways. Overall, AVOID THIS AT ALL COSTS! Major Pass!"
"Sorry, not for me. Was really hoping to enjoy this. But, similar to the last highly rated whodunnit, Murder on the Orient Express, I was left feeling somewhat underwhelmed and, dare I say it, bored. Give me Lieutenant Columbo anytime over this."
"The most unfortunate thing about this film is that it is not so much of a turkey that you don't flounce out of the cinema half way through like you ought to. Daniel Craig is seriously miscast as the all-knowing and complicit detective. How, ffs, are we to take this piece that mixes outright ridiculous scenarios - e.g. a privately employed PI telling the real law what to do, when etc. We have caricature cardboard cutouts of murder-mystery stereotypes, dreadful script and extremely poor plotting. We are left looking at all the gewgaws and other props that don't seem to have any significance or interest value to the characters. Two giant eyeballs on sticks, for example? We have the servant good, employer bad shtick given the modern racist wash but we've had enough of that laundry. Frankly, the whole enterprise is a bore-a-thon. If it was supposed to be funny, that went right over my head. Jokes normally make me laugh. This joke of a film left me dozing."
"Knives Out is a new crime drama directed, written and partly produced by Rian Johnson, the director of Looper and Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi.In the film, the successful crime novelist Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer) is found dead on his estate. Harlan recently had his 85th birthday which makes all the guests of his birthday party a suspect of the murder. Detective Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig) is now trying to investigate what happened and who is responsible for the death of Harlan Thrombey.This film is a new murder mystery film such as the 1985 film Clue, the film version of the board game Cluedo. As a viewer you try to discover together with the detective who is responsible for the death of the murdered character. Unfortunately, as a viewer you get more information about the murder mystery at a time than the characters in the film itself. So as a viewer you already know a little more than the characters and you can start to get ahead of the story. Rian Johnson tries to confuse you as a viewer with astray. Many of these traces are unfortunately not appropriately or clearly brought forward in the film, which means that final disclosures may seem somewhat unclear. Because of this lack of clarity, the film comes across as somewhat lengthy. With the film they try to explain everything to the viewers at the end, but this goes against the self-examination for which fans of murder mystery films watch such films.The cast of this film consists of many great actors and actresses such as Daniel Craig, Jamie Lee Curtis, Don Johnson and Christopher Plummer. Daniel Craig uses a separate accent in the film all the time, which sometimes makes him look more comical than really as a serious detective. Of the cast, Ana de Armas comes out best in the film as the maid of the deceased. As maids, she plays a major role in gathering information about the murder mystery, because she knows all the family members and worked for them. Furthermore, Michael Shannon manages to provide a few comic moments in the film as the youngest son of the deceased."
"Knives Out is entirely built around a pretty clever twist that comes early own. Once that's out, it slowly putters out of ideas until dragging itself back to the mansion where all is revealed ... to be an average episode of Murder She Wrote.Editing, cinematography and acting is all top notch throughout. But bent on delivering its one twist and nothing more, the story has left the characters without fleshing any of them out. Everyone is such a paper-thin stereotype that quite a while it feels inevitable they'd eventually turn out to be something more but instead they all end up being just as completely one-dimensional as they first appeared. Poorly written characters also ruin heavy-handed attempts to say something useful about immigration and privilege."
"I don't who is giving this film bad ratings, because it is everything you would want in a murder-mystery thriller. It takes a genre that has been done a million times and adds something new. Rian Johnson's script is sharp, witty, and at times heartbreaking. Go see this film! It is worth it!"
"But the movie was just plain boaring, formulaic and predictable. Fair acting and little character development."
"The first 30 minutes of this movie were really, really good. The cinematography is gorgeous, the dialogue snappy, the editing engaging. But it all fell apart once the first twist is revealed and Rian Johnson starts getting self indulgent.I really don't like that he likes to have meta lines about how stupid his writing decisions are as if that justifies them. For example, we get the most borning car chase in cinema and when it's over one character says ""that has to be the dumbest car chase I've ever seen"". Seriously, I'm not even kidding. The detective sounds like a Foghorn Leghorn parody and they point it out at the end of the movie as if that makes it any less ridiculous! The writing gets flat out stupid at times because Rian Johnson is a moron. There's a scene where the detective claims that the case is like a doughnut with a hole that needs to be filled by a doughnut hole. No, I'm not kidding. Rian Johnson is this stupid! Our lead character can't lie or else she vomits uncontrollably. No, that's not from a Simpson's episode, it's from the latest Rian Johnson picture.I was at a sold out showing and more people clapped at the end of the Dora the Explorer movie! Sorry, this was yet another messy Rian Johnson script filled with too many characters and random plot developments."
I've yet to like anything this guy has made. Maybe he just needs to quit. I've had more fun watching paint dry.
"Knives Out has found a way to turn many of the genre's tropes on their heads and that very much deserves to be praised. Ana De Armas is touching, vulnerable, truthful, endearing, and outshines pretty much the entirety of the remaining star-studded cast, which is also very impressive.
Overall, after a very clunky beginning, we get into the story and it moves pretty smoothly throughout, and the movie keeps its momentum going until at the very least, the end of the second act.But when we get to the third act, it starts to feel like the need for never ending twists takes over at the cost of logic and realism, which obviously is often the case in these kinds of movies. But, I would argue a truly successful murder mystery should end with the realization that we have been staring at the truth all along and yet couldn't quite see it - and in that respect, I feel like the movie fails.
It also fails in portraying characters that feel real for the most part - with the exception of Ana De Armas, everyone feels a little bit like a caricature, best exemplified by the sixteen year old teenage boy who spends his entire time on his phone to promote the alt-right. Many of such cliches are played for humor, but for the most part, the few comedic moments of the film fall flat - in particular, Daniel Craig's sadly clumsily delivered Detective character, meant to be an American Hercule Poirot, but whose quirks are simply forgettable and frankly, unimaginative.Finally, the story simply does not fully deliver on its themes, its conclusion feels rushed and shallow: good people end up happy, and bad people are punished, no redemption or nuance whatsoever, the story is black and white, and that may have worked during Agatha Christie's time, but I don't think modern audiences will accept it as easily."
I thought it would be a witty dark mystery about Daniel Graig as a PI who solves a murder mystery in a mansion. But was wrong. The film has almost no mystery. Much of it takes place outside of the mansion. It focuses almost entirely on a hispanic maid in order to make a painfully obvious political statement about how entitled white people mistreat immigrants. That's it. That's the whole film. There aren't reversals more than props planted and then hinted at later. Plot convenience and terrible writing. The film doesn't even make sense. This felt like a bad draft. My head hurts now.
"The movie plays like the worst episode of COLUMBO you have ever seen, only this time it features Daniel Craig attempting to imitate Foghorn Leghorn. Learn from my mistake and avoid this turkey."
"Knives out uses a really old idea, the ""whodunit"". Unfortunately, contrary to what many claim, there is not much here that makes it particular different or modern, except some hipster dialogue and humor (including a lot of throwing up by a specific character) and some commentary on current social issues, like the immigrant crisis, and pointing fingers at the ultra-rich, which is ironic because the writer/director of this movie is by now a multimillionaire and one of the highest paid directors in Hollywood. The writing is full of supposedly smart dialogue and ideas. In reality there not much cleverness here, while it constantly feels like the movie is trying too hard, and comes across as very pretentious and smugish. Most of the humor falls completely flat, it is overlong (130 minutes), twists are not surprising and don't really make sense. Only bright spots, Daniel Craig's amusing performance and the very talented Ana de Armas. Other than that, a semi-entertaining, mediocre and ultimate forgettable film. A perfect example of an uninspired writer/director, with a complete lack of originality, who uses a boring overused premise and accomplishes nothing new or interesting in the least.Personally I don't know much about Star Wars as I don't really follow pop-corn franchises, so I don't know what's going on with this director and Star Wars. However, it is very puzzling seeing this mediocre film which basically takes place in a house, getting so much marketing hype and buzz, while Hollywood seems to be in love with this movie and its' director. Looking around the internet for reviews and ratings one would think this is a serious Oscar contender for multiple awards, while some people are calling it the best movie of the year and calling out trolls (?) etc. I'm confused."
"This film is just awful. It's just really boring. Didn't enjoy it at all and what is going on with Daniel Craig? His voice/accent is just terrible.
I would not recommend this film."
"So, this is a bad remake of Clue... but...""The bad scores are because of Star Wars fans"" And, honestly I am sure that some of them are... but once more we see people attacking anyone that doesn't give a Rain Johnson 10 out of 10.""The bad scores are conservative trolls"" And once again we see people, and Johnson, attacking anyone that doesn't like this film.Once again people are throwing a fit because other people don't like the exact same thing they do.But to be honest, again, I can see that. This is overtly political, and by ""overtly"" I mean that they are screaming through a megaphone, at just about every opportunity, to inject their politics into it.Other than that, it is kind of like Clue... if Clue was very careful not to insult some people in their jokes, and very focused in an attempt to insult others with a sheer and unadulterated prejudice. And that kind of makes for a very awkward film where the jokes are so self-aware they can't help but fail.So, basically that is what you are getting, Clue with jokes aimed at the politically correct and a hearty injection of politics. And that is all you are getting.But, hey, if you haven't seen Clue, you might like it. And, if you share the politics and think they should be shrieked in everything, you will totally like it.The rest of us are just going to watch Clue."
"This movie was boring and predictable. Clue is worth watching, this is not. Jokes did not land. I am baffled by the high reviews. Save your money, this is a movie to wait to watch for free if you are looking to pass a few hours. Highly over rated, definitely over hyped."
"The movie was good, but there was really no need to insert the political opinions right in the middle of it.
People go to the movies to escape things like politics which they are bombarded with everyday. The audience is having a great time, then the writers think it's a good idea to place an argument about trump right in the middle of the movie, come on!"
"'Knives Out' was written and directed by Ryan Johnson, the man behind films like 'Looper' and 'Star Wars: The Last Jedi'. I have my problems with The Last Jedi, but I can't rate a film based on a directors earlier film.Let me start with what I didn't like. This isn't your normal run of the mill who done it. The first act you learn something very vital to the plot and from there you don't feel much tension until the third act. With that in mind, my friends and I were still glued to the screen trying to piece together everything that was going on. It in the end was a bit predictable, but this didn't ruin the experience for me. The other thing I really didn't care for was Johnson's use of politics. Now I'm not a very political person, but he uses this to make some characters look ""evil"". I didn't see it when I first watched the film. I was very surprised he even added it in the script, but after thinking about it, he used it as a tool to make characters look more sinister. It's understandable why, but you can write characters to be hated without being political. I even laughed at one of the jokes that was said during this scene until I realized he was actually making a jab at people who think that way. But again, I'm reviewing the film - not people's political views.Now what I liked. The acting was phenomenal across the board. Everyone was a stand out to me except for actor Jaeden Martell (Lieberher). He was previously known for his role as Bill in 2017s 'IT'. He does the best he can with what he is given but he really isn't in the movie, his character just sits around on his phone like me writing this review. I wish I could commend every performance in the film but we would be here all day. My two stand outs would be Chris Evans and Toni Collette. There was also a fun cameo by Frank Oz which was great. This film also has a great fresh style and direction. The way he opens the film really made me cheese. The way he wrote the film was also great. The little clues he gives you throughout were very clever and it kept me on the edge of my seat, literally. The film was also very funny; I was very surprised on how much comedy was in it.Ryan Johnson's 'Knives Out' was a great film with fantastic acting! The story was engaging with a satisfying ending! It was a great time at the movies and I recommend checking this one out. It's no masterpiece, but this gets me excited for what new and engaging stories Johnson has up his sleeves - just stay away from 'Star Wars'.Final verdict: 7.5 / 10That's my 2 cents!Alex Bioni"
"Probably the best film I have seen this year and one of the most memorable theatrical experiences I have ever had seeing it at its world premiere at TIFF. Thanks to the success of his previous studio film, The Last Jedi, Johnson gets to create a passion project that is so desperately needs to be seen in theatres.Johnson shows his love for the murder mystery genre but avoids falling into its predictable plot mechanics. The opening of Knives Out sets the table of what you would expect from this kind of premise on paper. The death of the celebrity author Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer) brings in all the family members seeking the opportunity to selfishly claim his inheritance and the strange circumstances of his passing calls in private investigator Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig) to solve the case. But once most of the character archetypes are established within the first act, Johnson allows his originality as a filmmaker to take over. From they're the perspectives shift and the twists elevate the story in a direction that is refreshing and surprisingly really funny. The humor becomes unrelenting and infectious, as everyone in the theatre could not hold back the laughter, with Johnson playing on genre's tropes and being meta about it.Johnson lets each of the cast members have fun and stand apart from one another with each playing really dynamic and complex character he has written. Chris Evans just relishes in playing the ruthless and yet complex grandson Ransom and doesn't hold back on spitting insults to anyone including his own family members. Michael Shannon plays a role slightly less antagonistic and more pathetic as youngest son Walt who gets no respect from his family. Jamie Lee Curtis continues to be a force of charisma to watch as the eldest daughter Linda. Even smaller but no less significant roles like Noah Segan and Lakieth Stanfield are also worth calling out.While Daniel Craig may get top-billing in the poster, the movie completely rest on Ana De Armas to carry the story and serve as the audience's perspective into this world. As Harlan's nurse Marta, she shows how isolated and alone she feels with the rest of Thrombley family despite they pretend to have her best interest. But as the plot progresses, De Armas gets to show range including some unexpected comedic moments and becomes more of a pivotal role in the mystery.
Daniel Craig gives full commitment to his over-the-top character. Craig as Blanc gets some of the best and most hysterical lines as he spout bizarre and confusing analogies in a super-thick Southern accent. He strikes a good balance of intelligence and hysterical as a man who is very perceptive of people's intention but also being really exaggerated and ridiculous in a good way.Similar to what he did with the Star Wars franchise in the Last Jedi, Johnson brings in social political commentary into a very old and tired genre to make if feel relevant. In this case, he uses the Thrombey family dynamic to tackle issues on the wealth of the 1%, immigration and self-entitled privilege. In the opening interview, Harlan's adult kids and in-laws all say they believe that each of their successful careers come from hard work despite flashbacks reveal they leech off of Harlan's own self-earned wealth and celebrity name. And with Marta coming from an immigrant family and being Harlan's personal nurse, the Thrombey's keep acknowledging subtly and (unsubtly in a heated family argument about politics) her lower status in society to boost their ego even they think it comes from a sense of sympathy. The oblivious nature and lack of wokeness most of the family retains (particularly with Don Johnson's and Toni Collete's characters) shows how much they have been too sheltered in their own rich bubble that creates a lot of great satirical humour.Regardless if you liked or disliked The Last Jedi, are fan of Rian Johnson in general as a filmmaker or just love the murder-mysteries in film, Knives Out is a big crowd pleaser that uses its huge big name cast to full efficiency. Just when you think you have the plot figured out, it adds twists upon twists that don't dragged down the story but elevate. Once it comes out in nation-wide theatres, see it as soon as you can."
Rian Johnson is terrible at his chosen profession. This movie is predictable and it's attempts at humor are juvenile and fall flat. It felt like it was 4 hours long as I found myself wanting it to end about 30 minutes into it. Not worth your money or time.
"Actually i do not know what to think, the movie is normal and it cointatins not good performances, for me, the best was Martha, but the rest too much normal, mhmmm i guess i willonly watch this movie onece because my expectative were above than the movie, it is a normal movie, even more, it is not funny and the final part does nto contain surprise or a sort of inteligence, I did not like it"
After hearing the reviews I was ready for an amazing movie. This is not it. It is boring and is one of those subverting expectations movies.. where every 10 minutes a new shock happens. This makes for a disjointed movie but not a good one. You can tell from the cast that the liberal elite wanted to make this a great movie but it is clear no one knows what that is anymore. Rent Clue.
"You can't go to the movies anymore. Everything is just junk propaganda.In this one, the migrant inherits everything, because has a kind heart and from a higher stage is going to cast judgement upon the unworthy, wasteful.
The End."
"I don't know what motivates the people who give this a 10/10 review or claim that it is the best movie ever. To be honest the movie is below average, and I found it more annoying than entertaining.
Daniel Craig's accent is ridiculous and he can't do comedy, although in fairness to him the attempts at comedy in the film are universally poor.
I was bored/irritated. Wait to see it at home."
"After a really strong setup the movie falls apart after the first act and never regains its footing. The focus is lost amid several twists and turns, some predictable, some nonsensical, which is exactly what a twist shouldn't be. The direction is good, though there's a little too much bathos and again a loss of focus on the plot, which isn't the worst thing, since the plot falls apart. The movie feels about an hour too long and towards the middle you just want it to be over. It's a real shame, because it started so promising."
Is this supposed to be a comedy? I think I might have chuckled twice. It's like Kevin Hart. You like the guy and you want to laugh; but he is not Rodney Dangerfield who had some good material.
"I would rather have played clue that watch this as it was slow and in the end lacked a plausible payoff, ugh."
"The shills are out in force for this , frankly forgettable, movie. There seems to be a constant stream of 10/10 reviews which read as though the poster hasn't even seen the film.
The film looks good but the plot and character motivations don't make much sense in the face of anything other than casual scrutiny.
That said I did enjoy the first act. If the rest of the film had continued in that tone it would have undoubtedly earned a higher score for me.
The second act is very pedestrian and drags,but the film falls apart in the denouement.
Has zero rewatch potential. Wait for it on TV or streaming."
"First of all, for people complaining about the rating/score: NOT EVERYONE LIKES THE SAME THING. Just because it's a score you don't agree with doesn't mean it's a conspiracy theory or botsNow onto the proper review.Like others have said the premise alone is simple and we've known it for ages because a that very simple premise is a board gameSadly all the star power in this movie can't save it from the cliche and plodding of the movie and it's pacingIf movies have to result to padding because they don't want such a short run time maybe they should suck it upThe wokeness  shocking considering the show is done by Roam Johnson who along with JJ Abrams have been ruining the Star Wars trilogy"
Storyline is lame at best. If you just want to watch something while you munch on popcorn you may like it.
"The movie was below par, the story was so predictable from the beginning. When you cast Chris Evans and give him a lesser screen time, it was obvious he is the antagonist. However, apart from my prediction, the story was so boring, non - humorous, less intriguing and dragging screenplay.
This movie is either over hyped or certain critics lost their taste for good cinema."
"Film is complex, but in a way that's unclever and unnecessary. Very poor storytelling and directing. If you're planning on watching the film to see the star-studded cast, you're better off just spending your time watching Endgame or What's Your Number again."
"Meh, it's okay. Not great, not terrible.Not as clever or smart as Rian wants you to think the movie or he is. I saw the ending coming about halfway through, and this isn't by any means ""original"" as Rian tries to sell it to be.This was a slow SLOW moving movie with little to no tension and a predictable ending.Rian Johnson's talent for mystery and suspense is on par with Daniel Craig's southern accent in this movie-not good.I can say that I'm glad I saw it in a theater to support movie going, but Rian has really overhyped this movie and wants you to believe it's a masterpiece he's created when it's really a slow-moving mediocre film at best without much substance at all.MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS did mystery and suspense much better than this one. Maybe I'm biased because I saw it right before this one and can't help but compare the two. Artistically, narratively, musically, and emotionally, this film doesn't even come close."
"Another disappointment from Rian Johnson, this movie was so badly written and acted, I'm glad I used my AMC A-List to see this bc I would have demanded a refund!"
"I really was not expecting a ""spoof"" of a movie. Especially with Daniel Craig in the movie. Slap happy is good sometimes but with all these fantastic actors I was shocked and so bored with this movie."
"Complete tosh. What does it tell you when the audience is praying for the film to end so we can all go home.
What idiot gave this the green light I'll never know.
Daniel Craig will be mortified when he looks back on this. His best friend must bite the bullet and tell him man to man that he's made a fool of himself. His Fohorn Leghorn accent is just cringing.
Dear film buffs save your money."
"What could have been a good movie is ruined by the political nonsense. The trailers don't show you this, but it influences the movie in a big way to the point of being incredibly preachy and annoying like Terminator Dark Fate. If this bothers you, don't see it."
"Casting and the picture (scenery) were the only good things. I could not focus on Daniel Craig's American accent and he seemed out of it too. Marta was made this incredible person with the best heart in the world, fighting all those mean white people.. I think the characters could've had more depth to them. Storyline was manic. The bad boy, outcast, the most obvious choice was the one who did it. I could say that the bits of the plot were unique but not very intriguing or shocking."
"Guarantee the majority of people who rated this film 1 Star and scroll through the reviews marking them as uninteresting are simply children who didn't like The Last Jedi. News flash, that was a great film and so is this one. It's tense, funny, witty, and interesting from start to finish."
"Wow I mean I expected it to be good but wow.
This movie has you guessing until the very end and subverts your expectations to the fullest.
The humor is so good and classy.
CHRIS EVAS wow is he good in this movie and it's so fun to see him playing other characters than CAP (witch I love) but he shows off his acting skills like never before.
Daniel Craig is amazing in his role and is truly a stand out of the movie.
All the cast is amazing and the new actors we see like Ana de Armas show great talent.
Ryan Johnson really does it well after receiving so much hate for Star Wars the last Jedi (that I personally liked) he shows how good of a director and story teller he is.
Over all a must watch, and one of the best movies of the year."
Knives out had the potential to be a very good movie. It has a great cast and it is very well acted. The story though was shallow and the only thing funny was Daniel Craig's accent. The pace is slow and the misdirection to me was obvious. I enjoy mysteries and had this one this partially figured out right after Blanc's interview with Marta. Rian Johnson once again tried to outsmart himself with poor humor and lazy writing. I think his head is swollen from Star Wars and the controversy it created.
Plot does twist and turn which is fun. Daniel Craig accent is horrible.
"Man watching this movie just reminds me of a lot of movies we have seen before ABSOLUTELY nothing new and it's so obvious who done it after 30 mins, Chris Evans done it but it's so boring I was gonna leave but stayed in case there was a good twist but no ..noting. sux really"
"Knives Out is an okay movie. There are so many haters of this film rating it 1-stars just because they don't like Rian Johnson and what he did to the Star Wars: Last Jedi apparently and a lot of others who rate it 10-stars to revoke the 1-star ratings. But the movie is basically ok. And I'm sad to acknowledge it as I really, really wanted to like it. I mean c'mon look at the cast!Knives Out is ok for basic entertainment when you don't have anything else to do and just want to have fun at the movies but it has soooo many plot holes and insults to the viewer that I can't just close my eyes on them.You know there's this saying that if you start explaining the joke then it's not funny. It's about this movie exactly! They do so much explaining that your brain hurts. It's basically an insult because I kinda sat there and felt that there shouldn't have been so much explaining. I mean sometimes you gotta trust the audience. That they'll get it. This is either inconfidence in yourself or in the audience. There's at least like 15 minutes of the movie explaining itself and what's going on but they could've done it in a more subtle way with hints, looks and feels. Not with words. The movie has so many shifts and turns that you kinda look at it funnily. And not only the plot turns but also the movie and genre itself. It's almost like it's not as self-aware.This might be one of the very few times that I'll say I didn't like the acting in an American film. They all are great actors and Americans are somehow natural at this but this film didn't even require a whole lot of range from them. It relies on its script of a ""whodunit"" and beautiful cinematography and scenery to carry out the film. Actors were acting like in a play or smth. Do you remember those theatrical experience where acting is over-the-top? When it's just too much? There's a scene at the end where a man is trying to bribe a policeman by waving money in the air, in front of them, when everybody's looking. That's zero subtlety. You feel like you're getting spoon-fed smth that could've been done in a more serious fashion.When you turn 180 degrees, you're basically back at the same spot Rian. Quit turning.
It's a solid OK"
Daniel Craig and Toni Collette must be laughing all the way to the Bank. I saw this piece of rubbish tonight in Sydney with two friends. They both dozed off to sleep during this tedious nonsense. I can't believe some of the Actors putting their names to this. DON'T BOTHER !!
Go rent or stream clue and save yourself a few dollars
"Refreshing Murder Mystery
Beautiful shots
Amazing combination of star casts"
"I really wanted to like this film. I love whodunit films, from Agatha Christie to Murder She Wrote, the intrigue and mystery of this sub-genre can be very interesting and entertaining in the right hands. Yet here, with this film, none of the intrigue or mystery is either interesting nor entertaining, and like the awful humour, misses its mark! I like puzzles that hint at me, not hit me over the nose, and 'Knives Out' is a poor man's murder mystery - a very easy 1 out of 10."
"It's clear Ruin Johnson hasn't learned from his past mistakes and once again, has come up with a mediocre movie that is being protected by the media for being politically left leaning. The story put me to sleep, the characters left me yawning, and the ""twists"" were predictable. It's clear that people and ""critics"" are giving this good reviews because of the round headed baby's political views. This movie is absolute garbage and everyone should avoid this movie like the plague."
"I have never seen any Star Wars films and have no knowledge of this director. I went to see it because of the starry cast and a good review in The Observer, a UK paper I respect. Also, I like country house whodunnit stories.
This was however a big disappointment. The warring family were uniformly horrible; I suppose they were meant to be, but they portrayed it so well that it was just unpleasant to watch. Daniel Craig has been an excellent Bond (and earlier, very good as Francis Bacon's lover), but here he was just awkward and his accent pretty ridiculous.
There was plenty of humour, which was OK at times, but overall that just meant that the film didn't seem to know whether it was a comedy or a serious story.
The worst bit was the long final denouement part, which was incredibly verbose and convoluted. I wasn't left feeling sad, happy, satisfied, intrigued or even angry - just flat. Avoid this film."
"I didn't like The Last Jedi and i didn't like Knives Out either. I guess i just don't like his style. In my honest opinion he isn't very good at directing or storytelling.
In fact i rather watch Michael Bay movies than Ryan's. Michael at least had some decent stuff like The Rock.1/10"
Starts of good but then just becomes boring ..I found myself looking at my watch alot . Predictable NOTING NEW . Better to wait for it on a free streaming site
"This movie has arguably the worst writing I've ever experienced. I was incredibly excited to see it for months. I tried to stay away from excessively watching trailers or reviews to come in with as little of an expectation as I could. Which for me was hard. I adore the entire cast, I have thoroughly enjoyed some of Rian Johnson's earlier work (Star Wars excluded), and I got caught up in the nostalgia of a thrilling ""whodunnit"". Upon seeing it, I was very quickly shocked by the lack of originality, the completely cheesy dialogue, and a horrendous and obvious plot. I have never walked out of a theater in my life but this is the closest that I've ever come. I openly laughed at how bad the dialogue and plot points were. The entire theater was silent except to grimace. Don't waste your time or your hopes."
"We always hit the movies over the Thanksgiving holiday with whoever is in town. 4 of 8 fell asleep at one point and all 8 of us were underwhelmed. Kept waiting for the plot to ignite, never happened."
"Once again, Rian Johnson proves himself to be a great director (particularly with visuals) but an absolutely awful writer who's obsession with exploring social/political themes always comes at the cost of turning almost every plot point and character ark into MacGuffins. For the record, I actually agree with his politics so please don't me. But good stories make for intelligent social commentary, not the other way around.The cast are brilliant though so that's something!"
"Hollywood loves this director, most people do not. When you read the bad reviews they point towards unfunny jokes, slow pace, and some bad acting leading to that score. When you read positive reviews it says they are retaliating against Star Wars fans who dont like Johnson. I figure they are deserved either way."
"I won't get into the social commentary the film is trying to convey. It just seems the ""mystery"" was an after thought and the agenda was the primary. I wanted a true mystery in Agatha Christie fashion but was let down. The acting is great and I did laugh but wait until it's on HBO."
"This movie is plot-centered. Character development is limited to what is necessary for establishing motivations and relationship dynamics among the characters. This is similar to a movie like Murder on the Orient Express, while I am not comparing the quality of the two movies.The little details explicitly shown or mentioned in the movie are paid off by the end. There are a few times when there's a bit of a question about someone acting out of character, but they're points that can be explained away.The big negative is the politics. One character development point involves the legal status of one character's family, so discussing that particular point is fair game. The grating yelling match about politics in the middle of the movie is not. It had nothing to do with the plot or motivations and took viewers out of the movie. But just hold on -- once it's over, the movie resumes.It's an entertaining movie with Daniel Craig again showing he can do a believable southern accent, if you can overlook the pointless political shouting."
"As the key character, the Latina nurse, Ana de Armas majorly under-acts whilst everybody else majorly overacts, particularly Don Johnson, Toni Colette and Jamie Lee Curtis. Chris Evans, the bad-boy grandson, seems to be channeling Rupert Everett.Writer/director Rian Johnson is clearly torn between homage to Agatha Christie and a send-up. If you're going to spoof Christie, you need to spoof one of her grander whodunits like MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS. KNIVES OUT, with its gothic-ish country house setting, is more reminiscent of THE MOUSTRAP, Dame Agatha at her creakiest. The Sondheim-scripted THE LAST OF SHEILA (1973) was not good, but it wasn't as clunky as this.This is tosh - and really not 'quality' tosh. Mildly - very mildly - entertaining. After his Southern-fried piss-take on Poirot, it's gonna be hard to watch Daniel Craig back in his 007 tuxedo next year."
"I don't understand reviews that are 10/10 .. Shouldn't they be for mind blowers ?This movie is fun, its undeniably a well thought out clean piece of cinema . a ten no ..If your into who done its . go see it .. Its fun .."
"The magnetic Daniel Craig as Benoit Blanc is by far one of the greatest filmic creations of 2019. This film, and specifically Blanc, brilliantly walks the line between campiness and seriousness; and, in doing so, is one of the most enjoyable theater-going experiences of the year. Just one of Blanc's ridiculous, Southern, overlong monologues about the pursuit of truth will have you laughing in a confused awe.This film's screenplay is smart, as it reveals crucial information early and still surprises and excites throughout. Similarly, this film tricks you into thinking you know the right information, just to show you how you've been missing it all along. Every detail matters, as crucial information is quietly planted in the first few scenes to end in loud, surprising payoffs. Knives Out is a tautly written whodunit.This movie is beautifully clever, and I recommend it to anyone with a free afternoon."
"Had all the makings of a great film, but an incredible cast and their stellar performances couldn't lift this film out of ""dumpster fire"" territory. What a shame the storytellers couldn't keep their latest weird Californian politics out of it. The sooner Trump gets voted out, the better, then Hollywood can return to good movies.Decent cinematography and a great performance by Daniel Craig especially might make it tolerable."
"Can't say much about the plot without giving away spoilers, but I can say everyone should go right out and see this when it hits theaters. I can't remember the last time I had so much fun watching a film and enjoying the audiences combined reactions to it. There were so many laughs and gasps and then outright cheers and clapping when the movie was over. It was THAT good! The whole cast was amazing! I mean, why wouldn't they be, considering what an incredible list of actors there are in this? But really, they all were on top game with their acting. You know you're going to get great performances when you can see that the actors are genuinely having the time of their life playing their characters. They were just chewing it up and the banter between them was so entertaining to watch. Rian Johnson is an amazing writer and director, there is no doubt about it. I did not want to see the movie end because I was just having a blast and then when it did, I immediately wanted to see it again. For hours after seeing it, I just kept playing parts over in my head and thinking ""My God! That was brilliant!"" With the theaters recently over-dominated with superhero movies, it's so refreshing to see a classic who-dun-it movie, and one done so perfectly well. I can not say this enough; you MUST see this when it comes out in theaters or you'll be missing on a great gem of a movie. This is brilliant film-making if I ever saw it!"
"Knives out is a somewhat tedious, somewhat hammy whodunit.Despite the director's imfamy for mediocrity, and the telltale sign of disapointment that is a star-studded cast I still decided to see the film. Got what I deserved - a slightly achey backside and that awful feeling of having been ripped off.Too many of the cast appear miscast. Daniel Craig especially. The accent he was using did not work and breaks immersion every time it is audible.4 and a half stars."
"'Knives Out (2019)' is the kind of movie they don't make anymore, a mansion-based whodunnit with an all-star cast and a charismatically quirky lead, but that doesn't mean it's old-fashioned. In fact, it feels fresh, modern and genre-literate. It uses its cinematic awareness to craft a devilishly enjoyable fable, a fun and evolving mystery that delivers the goods on pretty much all fronts. Despite what the marketing would have you believe, Daniel ""Bored Of Bond"" Craig isn't the protagonist. This makes for a detective story in which the detective isn't the one you want to see succeed, even though he isn't an antagonist in any shape or form, and this is rather refreshing. By giving certain aspects of its story away shockingly early, the flick leans away from suspicion and head-first into suspense. Johnson still manages to add an ample amount of wrinkles to the plot as it thickens, though. It's unpredictable and engaging throughout, peppered with the sort of surprises that the genre demands. Even though it does end with the typical, detective-led exposition dump, it's an incredibly satisfying experience. This is primarily because you're always engaged by proceedings, kept on your toes as the ultimately rather unique story unravels. It's a crowd-pleasing affair, a clever twist on its well-worn premise that still conforms to certain expectations. It's also fairly well-written, dialogue-heavy but not plodding, and has a good sense of tone, playing with the absurdities of Cluedo-esque situations without reducing its overall sincerity. It's aware of what it is but it isn't annoyingly meta. The crisp cinematography compliments its almost timeless feel, while the assured direction establishes itself as stylish yet subdued. Every core player plays their role excellently, no matter how much time or attention they're actually awarded. That includes the previously mentioned Craig, whose chewy southern drawl actually isn't as distracting as it could have been. Shannon, Evans, Plummer and De Armas stand out as being particularly good, too, regardless of the size of their role. Much of the family is side-lined for the majority of the time, but their presence is still keenly felt and they sufficiently support the more important characters. It's hard to imagine a cast better than this and everyone delivers on the unspoken promise of their inclusion. In the end, this is a surprisingly intelligent and entertaining experience. It generally keeps getting better as it goes on. When everything falls into place, it's hard not to get a smile on your face. 7/10"
"If I had a chunk, a piece, the tiniest little fragment of Rian Johnson's mind, I'm still not sure I'd know what to do with it. Forgive me for the number of superlatives in this one.Knives Out is astonishing. An immensely entertaining, thrillingly escapist whodunnit that pulls the rug out from underneath you more times than you can count. Every line has a payoff, every hint has a resolution. It's razor sharp and uproariously funny, with Johnson giving every cast member enough juice to play with but plenty of room to still have their own unique kinds of fun. It's a writers' movie through and through, but the cast still shine.Saying any more and properly diving into what Johnson is really doing here risks spoiling elements the film, and Knives Out is not a story you want spoiled. Johnson reliably plays with formula, he riffs on Vertigo and adds layer upon layer, having a blast as he does so - and it's infectious. Sharp, fast, funny and beautifully satisfying down to its body-tinglingly cathartic final frame. Knives Out is a fiendishly and relentlessly clever film, but Johnson does what he always does - he makes it look easy.My favourite film of the year."
"Great cast. But as expected,.. nothing original. Don't waste your money and time.
If you're into murder mystery genre... then go watch Murder on Orient express.
Way more fun."
"This movie actually does something quite interesting, it tells you whodunit right up front. To be honest this took me by surprise and I was pleased to find out that what follows is where the mystery starts actually unraveling. Actors are all great in their roles , although most are barely on screen and that's a shame with such a great cast . But it flows very well and things find a way to make the audience react at the right moments , this is due to some nicely directed moments and some perfectly read dialogue. I would have loved this film and given it a much higher score if it just had a little something more . If the twist wasn't so damn noticable to the point of making you say 'it can't be that because it's to obvious' . If there was just a tad more meat on its bones. I'm being a tad picky , it's a fun and perfect way to enjoy a couple hours. Go check it out."
Buncha salty Star Wars fanboys didnt like TLJ so they think he can never make a good movie again.No matter. Glad to see people with brains are seeing the film and giving it the marks it deserves. The movie is fantastic and a thrill from start to finish. Tons of twists and turns and smartly written. Go see it. And then give it a good review here so intelligent filmmaking can prevail.
"Too long, made for tv movie, mediocre acting, few good lines from Craig no other redeeming factors"
"I'm a fan of ""whodunnit"" genre, really like to work my brain and Clue in all it's craziness is one of my all time favorites. Not to say I don't like the more serious ones, I loved Gosford Park, Name of the Rose etc. This seemed like a great movie to see.Starts out pretty good, fast paced and quirky, the cast is great, but for me the movie fell apart as soon as they showed the murder/death/suicide. It was quite early to the movie and you know at that point that this can't be the whole truth, even tho you've just seen exactly how it happened. After that it's just guessing what lead to it or how they cover up for it.There are tons of clues on the way, a few of them very obvious ones and you kind of know quite early on who actually is to blame, you just aren't sure why. And it's a bit problematic for a whodunnit as the rest of the cast don't really seem very probable murderer. There is basically just one very unlikable character (ok, maybe two, but the other is too small part to be the murderer).But even tho the clues are quite obvious, the path to conclusion is everything but. It was somewhat interesting to watch everything unfold, but a certain key character had such a small part (Fran) that guessing everything seems like a very difficult task.What comes to acting and direction I think most did ok, but what started out as fast paced quirky show, went somewhat flat in the middle. Pace slowed down, Daniel Craig in my opinion delivered quite stale performance after starting out being more interesting. Direction wasn't quirky enough to be a proper comedy after all, only delivering a few good laughs. Most of the time the movie was just a crime drama.Could've used some trimming at over two hours long, I did feel drowsy halfway.Then the political part. Unnecessary in my opinion in a movie like this.I do like the fact that ""good guys win and bad guys loose"". It was a good movie anyway, but not really a masterpiece."
"This could've been a perfectly enjoyable 1h40m popcorn flick for the Christmas season. It would have been okay at its over 2 hour length, had it been sitting at 71% on the tomatometer. However it's at 97%, and I fell asleep during the slow part in act 2. After that, it picks up and becomes a decently satisfying comedy thriller. Chris Evans character really spices things up, and Michael Shannon finally gets to do that thing he does at his best. Daniel Craig's campy foghorn leghorn performance is so over the top, that they call it out to the audience. He was at least oddly entertaining. Ana who plays the main character is dressed way down to look average, but it's impossible to hide her beauty and charm. I wish her character had more depth. She ends up mostly being stand in for the audience, rather than an active participant in the story.There was a rather pedestrian twist at the end, which wasn't really. Everything plays out as expected. There are several overt political lines and issues in this movie. It's hard to know if Rian Johnson thought he was making a grand statement about classism in the United States. The politics just felt kind of tacked on to the kooky family mystery story.See it if you have time to kill. Just don't expect to be blown away."
"While I recognise that people have different tastes and all that you would be best advised to ignore all the 1/10 reviews on here. Please leave baggage, politics (this film is not political - it's a social satire) and Star Wars at the door to the auditorium.
Brilliantly acted by an A list cast, a humerous direction, a film that captures every little nuance. And a plot that develops wonderfully.And remember that it's no good to fill a donut with a donut..."
"I am a huge fan of mystery novels, but when it comes to films there isn't much to love. But this one came along. I really love the story, the cast itself is already likable, the acting is superb especially Daniel Craig and Chris Evans. The set is just amazing. Will definitely see this one again."
"Murder mysteries are formulaic. You set the scene, fill it with the requisite sub-plots and characters to sustain curiosity, confuse and generally lead the audience up multiple and erroneous paths. Punctuate the storyline with revelations, flashbacks, re-enactments and twists and conclude with a satisfying reveal all.
All that is left is the dramatisation and the delivery.
Sounds simple enough.
Where this latest contribution struggles, stumbles and falls in a heap is the the casting. It needed actors. Ironically, there is no shortage here but the ones who can act be they stars or has-beens are all in minor roles while the main players are wannabes or never-wases who are unproven or in some instances disproven in dramatic roles.
What were they thinking?"
"I thought about going to the cinema to watch this movie... The plot was so interesting, the cast seemed good and couldn't stop feeling a bit of a cliché pre-viewing. I have to admit that I was on the edge of my seat the entire movie! Always trying to guess who did what and trying to connect all the dots. It's a superb suspense and intriguing movie but I also laughed so many times, a lot more than I was expecting. The cast was amazing but congratulations to Daniel Craig, really enjoyed his character. The thing is, you can watch the movie several times and even though you already know who commited the crime, if you pay close attention you will always discover and connect something new and sooner than before. Really entertaining and overall very good movie"
What an awesome movie! Me and my Mom really enjoyed this film. The entire cast was outstanding and Daniel Craig was just phenomenal. Really great way to end a perfect Thanksgiving day.
Went to the premiere and the movie is immense fun. It's a marvelous script and wonderful cast. Everything works beautifully and I would highly recommend it.
"With Ryan Johnson being the person that he is, meaning his Persona and how he acts on Twitter especially after the failure the launch of The Last Jedi oh, I wasn't really expecting much from the guy who wrote and directed The lacklustre Looper with Bruce Willis and Joseph Gordon-Levitt, but honestly I was surprised.The writing for this film is spot-on, very Agatha Christie murder on the Orient Express styled writing, with Daniel Craig being Poriot, and we even get some hints at Murder She Wrote in the film. I can honestly say that for the majority of the movie the writing was fantastic, there were some places during the middle of the film that were kind of like waiting in really high water, but eventually you do get out and it ends up being a great and memorable movie.If Rian Johnson keeps up like this, I'll become a fan again. 7 out of 10 for the originality, but honestly the pacing of the writing of the film could have been a lot better.I don't understand how this guy can write like this, something intriguing, well written and well-thought-out and stand by this, but not admit that the casino bright scene in Star Wars Last Jedi as well as the character of Rose Tico were completely unnecessary, stupid and a bad writing choice and idea in the first place."
What a waste of a stellar cast. The trailer shows almost all the scenes that the famous people are in together. The rest of the time you are watching a little known Cuban actress who is apparently the star of the movie. Yes I hated TLJ but I honestly hated this as well. Because the waste of talent of the cast a 1-star rating for me.
"I agree with a lot of people that the first part of the movie was good, but it falls kinda flat after that. The acting is good for the most part but the plot twists are mostly predictable and not that clever. The humor is ok.
I am also not a fan of the the left liberal politics thrown in to the movie where white people are bad and greedy and immigrants legal or illegal are good. Sorry the politics were forced and unnecessary.
Overall its entertaining but nothing great or memorable. It doesn't deserve anything higher than a 6 or 7."
"Is an entertaining movie with classic all star crime mystery movie which I enjoyed, though You might be able to predict the killer at the first half, but still that doesn't take away the overall experience as there were lots of funny and interesting moments in the movie.There are areas as a viewer felt needed more tightening
CASTThe movie holds a strong team of respected actors, however there was little to no chemistry between them at times which weakened some scenes in the movie.Also some characters had been overplayed by the cast at times.Despite his good performance Daniel Craig had difficulty holding to the Southern accent of Detective Blanc as his British accent would surface at time.STORYLINEThe mystery and twists weren't so kept tight together, as they were sort of predictable. And certain scenes were slightly dragged that either gave some clues away or felt boring.OVERALL Knives Out is an enjoyable movie specially with family."
"Knives Out is a murder-mystery movie in the key of old-fashioned Agatha Christie or Edgar Wallace novels and their cinematic adaptations throughout the sixties and seventies of the last century. This sounds worse than it is because a movie without an overdose of special effects that goes back to the basics is actually quite refreshing. Elderly audiences will adore this movie and it might as well introduce younger audiences to this almost forgotten type of cinema.This thriller works well for numerous reasons. The actors and actresses are veterans and talented youngster who complement one another perfectly. Young Cuban actress Ana de Armas delivers the goods as good-hearted caretaker who ends up mingled in a crime. Veteran Christopher Plummer is excellent as eccentric author who despises his own family. The diversified Daniel Craig convinces as mysterious investigator who tries to put all the pieces of the puzzle together.The locations and settings are simple but very efficient in this movie. Most parts of the film take place in a gorgeous mansion and even though the architecture and landscapes look splendid, the tight rooms and sinister decorations give the film a gloomy vibe. The few scenes that are filmed away from that location offer some refreshing diversity in form of small appartments, charming downtown areas and rural restaurants.The plot obviously comes around with a few twists and turns. However, those don't come as big surprises if you are familiar with this type of storytelling. Another minor issue is that too many details are revealed rather quickly through flashbacks. This movie would have been even better if it had given its audience the time and occasion to come to its own conclusions and put the pieces of the puzzle together.Still, Knives Out offers one hundred thirty minutes of old-fashioned but well-executed murder-mystery entertainment and convinces thanks to a solid plot, great locations and gifted actresses and actors. In addition to this, this film also offers some soial criticism by pointing out the egoism, greed and manipulation of the rich and the famous. If you want to know what kind of movies your parents or grand-parents enjoyed when they were younger, give this film a fair chance. Sometimes, going back to basics means advancing in the right direction."
"I have seen a variety of different reactions to the film, but I haven't seen one person point out the obvious. It's not taking itself seriously. I believe the film is a fun spoof of whodunnit movies. So convenient writing and dumb characters are kind of justified. It's not supposed to be taken seriously. Please just look at it differently and it will become so clear."
"Started out nicely in a big house with a rich dad. Fun seeing Christopher Plummer, Jamie Lee Curtis, and Don Johnson. Then it went downhill. The detective includes one of the member in his investigation (and she was no Jessica Fletcher). Soon it dissolved into the current theme of our times that immigrants (legal or illegal) are good and white people are bad."
"When 85 year old mystery writer multi millionaire Harlan Thrombley (Christopher Plummer) is found with his throat slit, foul play is naturally suspected. Previous to his demise he decides to cut his parasite family out of the will and give it to his nurse Marta, (Ana De Armas) much to the angry chagrin of the rest of the family. Meanwhile famed detective Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig) is brought on the case by a mysterious employer to untangle things.Clue anyone? Performances by all the suspects are arch and played for laughs but not many materialize. They are simply en masse a greedy, unctuous family offering broad performances and cringing personalities while Craigs corn porn accent grills suspects with marbles in his mouth.Rian Johnson's direction is anemic as he relies on guilty expressions in wide angle to advance his predictable plot that attempts to have two mysteries (one to clear our heroine, one to find the real culprit ) hanging in the balance and both are torpidly pursued.The real star is ultimately the mansion and its incredible interior of furniture, secret passages and fantastic wall paper that gives the film a Gothic mystery feel. It at least gives you something to look at while Craig mumbles and surly family members crumble."
I have a theory that the whole movie was one of Harlans books which he had written himself in. This makes sense because Harlan wrote Mystery books and according to one of the detectives during the interviews at the beginning that had great twist... Knives out is a mystery movie and at the end has a great twist.
"The big magnetic disk of knives was copycatted from GOT's throne. The boring, formulaic and deadbeat humorless dialog, the storyline, the scenarios and the plot were heavily copycatted from BBC's ""Masterpiece"" and ""Mysteries"" dramas, most were written, scripted and adapted from a bunch British housewives kitchen writers with poor logic and reasoning. Then,The two police detectives were extreme poor cast, one clown, one greenhorn. They didn't look and act like seasoned plain-clothe detectives.Daniel Craig's role in this movie is the biggest joke, albeit another wrong cast. Another character borrowed and capycatted from those typical BBC British detective crap, so-called DCI, detective inspector or some other titles. When two American detectives investigated a suspicious murder case and questioned all the family members one by one, you think a civilian P.I. would be allowed and sat behind those two moronic detectives? And what's the purpose of asking him to speak with a southern accent?All the family members in this farce were like cartoon's caricatures with exaggerated acting, talking, facial expressions, gestures....none of them looked natural and realistic enough, just gave a strong impression that they were trying very hard to mimic those characters in BBC's ""Mysteries"" and ""Masterpiece"".Spent so much money, signed up so many Hollywood talents, but ended up so inferior if compared to ""An Inspector Calls (2015)"". Just don't know how and why so many viewers are so excited with high praises."
"I love it when a movie surprises me. That happened a lot here.Halfway through, my wife and I were like, ""OK, it's all solved, where's the 'mystery' part?!"" And then ... well, a very enjoyable second half.I love murder mysteries because they resolve every tiny last detail in ways that prevent OCD nerds like me from complaining about plot holes or lazy writers. I'm really glad I took the risk despite the 6ish rating here and went to see this movie last night!I'm strongly tempted to rate this movie a ""10"" to offset all the ""disappointed"" fanbois... alas, this movie is merely an ""8."" ;)"
"My Review -Knives Out
My Rating 7:10I'm a little either side of appreciating this film it's very entertaining and well acted with a great cast including Daniel Craig who is very good as the Colonel Sanders Hercule Poirot also Jamie Lee Curtis as Linda Drysdale the matriarch of a dysfunctional family of self centred opportunistic characters .They are joined by Toni Collette, Christopher Plummer,Chris Evans and Anna De Armas as the Carer to the elderly rich author Harlem Thromby.No spoilers here I'm still thinking about the outcome and a little confused but my fellow movie viewing partner says it's more a retro crime comedy so perhaps I'm looking for logic where I shouldn't be.The Director also wrote the screenplay Rian Johnson who also wrote and directed the 3 episodes of the Breaking Bad series and Star Wars V111 The Last Jedi .
So tons of talented people involved in this entertaining film but to me it was a little like watching a film of a good stage play at times and I thought trying to be a little too clever for its own good"
"This is good - but it isn't great. Ana de Armas competently, if not vibrantly, takes centre stage with Daniel Craig - sporting a deep Kentuckian accent - playing the Poirot-esque private detective role. Chris Evans leads the remainder of this accomplished, if somewhat under-utilised cast in a murder-mystery caper that doesn't quite have the brio I'd hoped for. It moves along well enough, though and is good fun to watch. It just doesn't quite catch fire. It dips a bit in the middle too, and could probably lose about 20 minutes without compromising the story very much (if at all). You won't guess the ending - unless you have a crystal ball - so it's certainly worth going to see."
"An entertaining, clever, funny, picturesque and very heartfelt movie with fully satisfying ending."
"To put it mildly, director Rian Johnson's experience behind the camera last time around was a highly interesting and career defining one.Charged with taking over the new Star Wars saga in the form of the hotly debated The Last Jedi, Johnson found himself victim of countless online trolls, critics and universe obsessed fanboys, as his franchise turning feature found itself scrutinized like very few films do.With its issues, The Last Jedi was still a film with some great moments and interesting ideas and the man who gave us Brick and Looper has always been a fine filmmaker with runs on the board, so it's great to see the keen aficionado of mystery and whodunits deliver an enjoyable and fun romp without any pre-conceived constraints holding him back.Knives Out is the type of mystery film of old, filled with a rag-tag collection of characters and possible suspects as Johnson builds off the foundation of authors such as Agatha Christie and filmmakers like Alfred Hitchcock, to concoct an extremely well-written and acted film that is sure to insight much fandom moving forward.It's not a film of much lasting substance, despite some already looking to deep into its underlying political themes born out of the Trump era, but Johnson and his cast are just having an old-fashioned good time here as Daniel Craig's ""KFC"" southern detective Benoit Blanc and Ana de Armas's (Brazilian, Ecuadorian or other various countries of origin) nurse Marta Cabrera team up to uncover the mystery of author Harlan Thromby's untimely demise.With Craig on top form here and going the whole nine yards and de Armas continuing to prove to us all she could well be the ""next big thing"", Knives Out is a joy to watch whenever they get too command the screen and surrounded by one of 2019's best ensembles, that is highlighted by an against type Chris Evans going to the dark side with his loathsome Ransom Drysdale and Michael Shannon dialing it back as Thromby's son Walt, Knives Out is always watchable.It's a shame Johnson included one too many characters into his film though, as not all of the supports feel that needful to the story, particularly Jaeden Martell's teenage internet troll (regardless of what Johnson intended, this feels like a character getting a say at the Star Wars keyboard warriors) and Katherine Langford's granddaughter Meg, these type of characters feel like mere wallpaper in a film that shines best when focusing on its best components which remains throughout de Armas and the usually gruff Craig.The other slightly disappointing aspect to this murder mystery is the fact that its final pay-off doesn't exactly come off as much of a surprise and at over two hours, it would've been nice to have felt more rewarded with a genuinely mind-blowing reveal, but they're high expectations born from a film with a great premise and some lovingly staged ideas.Final Say -A fun statement from a director who seemingly had the world against him with his last film, Knives Out is a well-played whodunit and while the film doesn't quite stick the landing, there's much to enjoy leading up to it thanks to some great central turns and whip smart script work.3 1/2 doughnut holes out of 5"
"I had a fun time unravelling the mystery of Knives out, it takes so many twists and turns and executes the whole whodunit formula really well. The cast is fantastic every character in the film have very distinct personality traits that stick out and they are all played really well, Ana De Armas does a great job of being a protagonist that balances out all the exotic personalities these characters have. If one person stuck out the most in the film it was definitely Daniel Craig, the accent he puts on is fantastic while not exactly an accurate southern accent it is used in a way where its supposed to be exaggerated adding to the fun nature of the film. The writing is pretty great with the twists and turns blindsiding you at times making it more and more intriguing as the mystery slowly unravels.While I say the writing for the most part is great it has certain moments and sequences in the film that go for too long which can sometimes make you slightly bored and draw your attention away from the movie, it is quick however to getting you back to being engrossed in the mystery, if these sequences were slightly shorter and more concise it would benefit the film to me.While not perfect Knives out is a movie I had fun with and would be a whodunit I would recommend you watch especially if you're a fan of the genre or of the films fantastic cast members, 2019 is an excellent year for film and this just adds to that list."
"Knives out has to be the shallowest stupidest movie ever made. They just want to ca$h in on holiday money. Terrible plot, bad acting, but what do you expect with a dumb whodunit."
"Not satisfied with butchering Star Wars, Rian Johnson sets out to do a poor man's ripoff of the films of Jonathan Lynn like Clue and Greedy. The script is pretentious, trying way too hard to be clever, and is about as subtle as a sledge hammer to the face, the actors do the best they can with a dreadful script, but it's all around a waste of time that will only be enjoyed by hipsters.Anyone who creates a character to mock their critics is clearly too immature to be directing films. Stop giving this hack work and do not waste your time on this drivel."
"I like that this is less about whodunnit and more about WHOdunnit.
It's a predictable movie, but it seems almost designed that way. There's a lot of little twists and turns the film takes like a letter having invisible ink proving an affair or a character trying hopelessly to destroy evidence. While these things may be predictable or even plot devicey, it oddly didnt bother me much. I think that's because the movie has such an infectious personality. It's shot super well, the music is wonderful, and the cast has so much charisma. But the crowning achievement is the characters and the snappy dialogue they are given. All the characters have distinct personalities and motivations. Watching the characters interact is easily the most entertaining part. I really watching this surface level family slowly turn on themselves revealing how horrible they really are. They are all nice, but not really. They are all self made, but not really. The only truly good person is our main character and it's satisfying to watch her traverse this families mine field. You may not like the slightly lofty approach it takes but it works way better here then in Star Wars."
"'Knives Out' is a mostly-light-hearted timeless ensemble ""whodunnit?"" Essentially, Blanc (Craig), Elliott (Stanfield) and Wagner (Segan) are investigating the death of the patriarch of the Thrombey family, Harlan (Plummer). Thankfully, there's plenty of flashbacks in the first hour, so Plummer does get some screen time. We then meet the extended family and start to unravel various potential motives and inconsistencies in their stories.The cast is huge and all solid - Marta (de Armas) as Harlan's nurse, Linda (Lee Curtis) and Walt (Shannon) as Harlan's children; Richard (Johnson), Joni (Collette) and Donna (Lindhome) as their partners; Randsom (Evans), Meg (Langford) and Jacob (Martell) as Harlan's grandchildren. I think that the main 12 characters - needless to say, not everyone gets enough time to shine, as the focus is on Blanc and Marta trying to piece everything together.This is Johnson's first film since 'The Last Jedi' and it's very assured - excellent set design and cinematography, with a simple score. The hose is literally a life-size Cluedo game. The film drags a tiny bit in the 2nd act, but comes home strong. There's plenty of fun had by the cast and Craig clearly relishes the non-Bond role - even if his Southern accent gets annoying at times! Satisfying ending - nothing revolutionary, but enjoyable. I think we'll be seeing more of Ana de Armas in the future."
"It's definitely Not bad film but there was a lack of suspense and at times the film doesn't know if it wants to be a mystery or a comedy, it's a juggling act that at times drops the ball.
Still this is worth seeing, the performances are all great but I feel this could of been a lot better."
"If I had three thumbs I'd still manage a way to give this film four thumbs up! It's a masterpiece of a movie. The plot flows perfectly and the suspense keeps you guessing. All characters played their part and Daniel Craig, no doubt knocked the ball out of the park. You fall right into his character as soon as he opens his mouth...watch the movie and you'll know what I mean. Movie of the year for sure. Mystery, suspense, humor and a thrill. It's definitely a must watch."
"I have read majority of Agatha Christie novels, and Knives Out does a fantastic job paying homage to the Queen of Mystery. It's witty, surprising, and a great ride. I would recommend anyone that appreciates mysteries to go see this! Seeing it in theaters was also fun with a crowd laughing and gasping at the same time. We all clapped at the end of opening night!"
"If you don't like too much detectives, like I do, then you have to see this master peace for a change. If this would be tge normal standard of detectives, I would love it!Slowly the movie starts spinning up, soon enough you will be drawn into this movie, with great and humorous dialogues. And slowly the story unfolds. Very natural acting and great directors work. Actually the whole technical chain has been worked out with craftsmanship; the editing, lighting, the decoration, bits and props, camera work, the very accurate music that is there and isn't. This is synergy, beautifully made. I give it a 9!"
"This movie isn't good. I know the director has his fans and that's cool but this is definitely worth skipping. The all star cast is wasted by hardly having any screen time. The plot, despite being billed as clever, is derivative and easily figured out. The acting is mediocre. It seems the director peaked with Brick and continues his downward creative freefall. I had very high hopes for this, lower your expectations."
"The reviews didn't prepare me for how funny this movie is. There are a lot of fast quips flying by. Listen carefully or they'll get past you. For example, one character, after hearing Daniel Craig's southern accent, says ""What is this, CSI KFC?"" Hilarious! I didn't guess the real culprit. I was sure the entire movie and I was wrong. Lots of fun following the action and the portrayals. This is not a deep movie. It has a simple message: Sit back and enjoy the ride."
Good from start to finish. All laughs. Super smart. An homage to Christie that keeps you guessing and second guessing yourself to the bitter end. As a die hard Christie fan i got it from the start (insert slight brag)......but I was going back and forth throughout. Hard to make a nearly perfect mysteries but this one is bretty damn close
"Very nice movie, good acting too.
Good plot, mostly unexpected and kept the audience on the edge throughout the movie. Did not experience any boring parts during the movie.
There was a small element of predictability at the very end, but it was not important.
Thoroughly enjoyed it.
I would gladly watch it one more time."
"I thought it was clever and well done with some good bits of black humor. Right up my alley. The acting was great and I really enjoyed it. Even knowing that pretty much anything was a potential clue, the scene at the end with the knife still surprised me.Random side note: Parts of the movie were filmed in the town where I work so it was fun spotting familiar streets and shops. And the bar where I have attended many trivia nights also made an appearance."
10 out of 10 to counter all the idiot star wars rejects on here.Get a life you fat turds
"""Knives Out"" Review
(9/10)KNIVES OUT LEADS VIEWERS ON A THRILLING AND WICKEDLY FUN RIDE AS THE ENTIRE ENSEMBLE OFFERS BREATHTAKING PERFORMANCES IN THIS WHODUNNIT MYSTERY.
Though Rian Johnson is now perhaps best known for having directed Star Wars: The Last Jedi, across all his films, Johnson incorporates story elements that subvert expectations, delivering twists viewers won't see coming. That's all to say, Knives Out fits perfectly within his wheelhouse as a modern murder mystery whodunnit thriller. Written, directed and produced by Johnson, the filmmaker also surrounds himself with an astonishingly talented ensemble cast, who execute his vision with masterful precision.
Johnson's particular talent of keeping audiences on their toes is on full display with Knives Out, which follows a fairly standard formula for murder mystery movies - in that the viewers are shown little bits about the night of the murder as the mystery is slowly unraveled on screen. The filmmaker uses a deft hand in both setting up and pulling off the twists in Knives Out, laying the foundation for them long before viewers even see them coming. Astute audiences, especially those that revel in solving a murder mystery plot before the characters on screen, will pick up on the clues, but Johnson uses their expectations against them to keep even those viewers guessing.
In a film with plenty of colorful characters, Craig's Blanc is an energetic scene-stealer, even as de Armas' Marta is presented more as the film's protagonist. The actress and her more understated performance work well to make Marta the most grounded character in Knives Out, contrasting well against the more campy, over-the-top members of the Thrombey family. Collette's Joni is another scene-stealer, dropping a surprising number of one-liners, as Curtis's Linda is a more imposing woman - though her performance is just as fun.
Every aspect of Knives Out - from Johnson's directing and Craig's southern drawl to the satisfyingly chilling score and intricately detailed set design - comes together to form this lush, captivating murder mystery. Knives Out manages to combine the campy fun of Clue with a new and carefully crafted mystery, plus infuse some commentary about everything from detective stories to modern American politics, all while allowing Johnson's filmmaking voice to shine through. In the end, Knives Out is a wickedly fun masterpiece."
"But apparently if you are a red hat wearing deplorable, you'll be
miffed at the dialog that references that relate to you and yours. If you're an intelligent moviegoer, you'll enjoy the ride."
"Knives Out is entertaining, charming, and endearing. It keeps you guessing and every its plot is well-paced with twists: some you expect, some you don't. The ones you expect are more complex than they appear, and the ones you don't see are clever enough to keep you thinking.Craig is marvelous, and de Armas keeps her mystique from 2049. The ensemble has mesmerizing give and take which leaves for some genuinely inspiring scenes - if not for their content, but for their development.Its parts are great, and as a sum of its parts, it's magnificent. This well-timed, perfectly-lit film will have your face smiling, your mind racing, and the theater reeling."
"Knives Out has a great cast, a nice story, a hand full of twists and is a game changer in the whodunnit genre.
It's not one of my favorite movies of all time but I enjoyed. The characters are almost all interesting and made me want to know more about them. However, I think if you're expecting a blockbuster with some action sequences it's better change your expectations because Knives Out is a little slow but stills really interesting. I would say this is a clever film for all audiences."
"Why defenders of this film can't understand simple fact: people JUST get tired from unnecessary POLITICS in EVERY mediocre entertaining film. And this guy have his 1/10 not for Last Jedi, but for this cheap political pamphlet with direct offense to American majority, like we don't have already infamous Red Hollywood, and now they go again. I am from country with socialistic regime and this rhetorics will lead only to oppression of some classes. And then! I am telling this about that detective movie? YES! Its real shame that in 2019 we can't go to movie theater and don't get bunch of political statements in our faces. Maybe ratings of this film make them producers think that short-term cash-grab on liberal zoomers is really short-term. Or maybe we will get somedays some MPAA film rating system that include POLITICS in film and get for that R. Because they deserve it for propaganda to the children. Maybe I see the day when all Disney fosterling get their R-rating for propaganda and strong political themes."
"Knifes Out has more twists and turns than San Francisco's curvy Lombard Street. Once you think you've figured out who did this mysterious killing of an 85-year-old crime novelist, then your thoughts are discarded and you immediately think another suspect did the mortal deed.
Knives Out is a clever movie with an honest, plausible script. The actors are brilliant, and the dialogue is top-notch. But for those who get uncomfortable with an excessively talkie setting (and what who-done-it movie doesn't have a lot of dialogue), then this film may not be for you.
Knifes Out has its merits, and it is entertaining. As far as breaking new ground, this one isn't it. But pay attention to the curves in the plot and you might find yourself richly rewarded."
"Love or hate The Last Jedi this man can make films. This movie is shot greatly, well acted and has a good way to tell this story in very interesting ways. I love this film so much. I know that there might be a lot of hate towards Rian Johnson but he is a good filmmaker don't let one movie you may not like change your mind of this mans talent"
"The murder mystery isn't really a genre that has seen much exposure in Hollywood over recent years, studios more intent on setting up more profitable cinematic universes. Step up Rian Johnson with Knives Out, a classic whodunnit that brings us cinema's next great dysfunctional family.When Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer), a wealthy novelist, is found dead in his study, private eye Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig) is brought in to investigate his death, leading to clashes with the eccentric members of Harlan's combative family.With Knives Out, Rian Johnson has woven a tapestry of delightful twists and turns to keep the audience on their toes and guessing right until the end, littered with memorable dialogue and enough family feuding to last a lifetime ensuring the path to the truth is an extremely entertaining one. It's also one of the funniest films of the year, Johnson lacing the film with intricacies that can be easy to miss but play a major part in siding against such a despicable family. The attention to detail from Johnson in his narrative is nothing short of stunning.The Thrombey family would be nothing without such a high calibre ensemble bringing each and everyone of them to life with such verve and class. Daniel Craig is the star of the show with an exquisite performance as the eccentric private eye Blanc, Craig having a ball with the southern drawl and nailing the comedic beats to a tee. Ana de Armas gives her best performance to date as Marta, Harlan's nurse, the innocence and vulnerability shining through her incredibly emotive features.There isn't one member of the ensemble who feels out of place, the likes of Jamie Lee Curtis and Toni Collette bringing the sweetness as well as the viciousness when required. Chris Evans looks to be having an absolute blast playing a Tony Stark type character after playing the boy scout for so long in the MCU, his line deliveries having me in stitches at times. The great thing about Knives Out is that I have my favourites from an initial viewing however, the characters are all so good that my favourites could change every time I revisit it.Knives Out is one of the best cinematic experiences I've had all year, Rian Johnson serving up a real treat of a whodunnit for audiences around the world. If there's one character I'd love to see more of, it'd be Daniel Craig's Benoit Blanc."
"Who dun it? knives out is rated a 8/10 so i figured i'd watch it for myself. honestly, this movie is a solid 7 at most. its definitely not the best movie of the year but it has its moments. everyone did shine in their roles, but daniel craigs accent was unnecessary. his british voice would have made the movie much more pleasant and entertaining. at times the movie did drag but that tends to happen in 2+ hour long movies."
"The movie was extremely exciting and kept the plot moving very well, and at good pace unlike some other movies. Unlike other mysteries, this movie was not centered around the detective, which was a very entertaining aspect to the movie. One of the only downers was Daniel Craig's attempt at a southern KFC accent."
"Knives Out tells the story of the Thrombey's, an upper class family of wealth and importance celebrating the 85th birthday of the patriarch Harlan (Plummer), a day later Harlan is found with his throat slit and every one in the family, including the servants becomes a suspect, as they all have motive.It is very unique to see a murder mystery that is completely original, not a book adaptation nor a property of long standing fiction. These are original character in a pretty tired premise. When I walked into the theatre I was expecting this to play out like any old game of clue, or Sherlock, with Benoit Blanc (Craig) playing the eccentric private detective that puts every piece together in the end. However by deviating away from the traditional mystery formula, along with a great score and masterful/controlled camerawork, it really unravels its performances and characters in a funny and suspenseful way.This is a stellar cast, the two shining members being Chris Evans as Ransom Drysdale the spoiled grandson of Harlan and Daniel Craig as the inconsiderate southern detective. Both of them are playing against their type are truly transformative in their roles. They were not James Bond or Captain America, they were two people trying to figure out how to solve the mystery looming above them. The supporting characters are also great, Don Johnson, Jamie Lee Curtis, Michael Shannon, Toni Collette, LaKeith Stanfield and Ana de Armas as the son-in law, daughter, son, daughter-in-law, crime scene investigator and Harlan's caretaker do not just blend into the movie as they have clear personalities and motives for what they want to do. However some of the cast do just disappear into the movie, particularly Katherine Langford and Jaeden Martell as the other two grandchildren.Given the movie's affinity for subverting expectations, it may render some plot points moot or unimportant at times. Knives Out is no exception, this movie would set up some plot points that would make the mystery loom and linger on, however when everything is revealed these plot points may not get the resolution they deserve. Also some characters really only exist for four or five lines/jokes and then are basically forgotten about by the end. However this might be because of the visual storytelling at the end. With the right context and clues, the audience can infer the real ending, based on nothing but facial expressions, prop treatment and setting displacement. This is how we know we have a true master of acting and directing, when an object is shown and it gives us much more can be deduced than just what is seen on screen.Without spoiling anything, don't go into this movie expecting a traditional murder mystery, the trailers really set it up to be one, but this is a Rian Johnson film. I understand why people were peeved at him for his treatment of Star Wars, mainly because his subversion of expectations made them mad, as people grew up with the characters and story, so in a sense they belong to the public and they didn't like the liberties he took with the new additions he made. But these characters and this story belong to him and he can do whatever he wants with them. In fact the less you know, the better. Expect some foul play."
"I enjoyed this film from start to finish. It has enough twists and turns to make Agatha Christie proud. A family patriarch worth millions - ironically, from his outrageously successful mystery novels - dies in his huge country mansion following his eighty-fifth birthday party. Although it appears to be suicide, a world-famous detective who arrives on the scene isn't so sure.There are certainly plenty of suspects - his voraciously greedy family members have been sponging off him for years, and live in constant fear of being cut out of his will. Added to the mix is his young, sweet-natured nurse, who is the one person in the household he genuinely likes.What went down that night is revealed before the movie is halfway through - but is it the whole story? The detective (played with a Southern accent of indeterminate origin by Daniel Craig) and the nurse team up to unravel the old gentleman's death. But can either one of them trust the other?A sterling cast is in fine form - Jamie Lee Curtis as the victim's daughter swanning about the huge house, the incomparable Toni Colette as his widowed daughter-in-law and self-help guru, Don Johnson as the blustering son-in-law, Chris Evans playing against type as the smarmy grandson, and numerous others. Cast standouts are Craig and Ana de Armas, who shines in the part of Marta, the pretty nurse.There are humorous moments, but don't expect big laughs. Try to count the number of different South American nationalities ascribed to immigrant nurse Marta by this phony bunch as they keep insisting she's ""one of the family""....I'm not sure if they ever got the right one. There are a few pointed references to the social and political culture we live in as well.A very well-done movie, with the most natural-sounding dialogue I've heard in modern films - nearly all the characters talk like ""real"" people, with a singular lack of artifice. And I appreciated the fact that the gorgeous gothic mansion in its parklike setting is in itself one of the film's most outstanding characters. Its interiors must be seen to be believed.All in all,a highly enjoyable experience; I recommend it."
"If I have one criticism to lob at the movie, it's that halfway through it changes from a passive viewing experience to an active one. What I mean is it transitions from a movie where you are watching the story unfold with the detective, trying to figure out who did the murder, to a movie where you are expected to root for the characters and their lives/outcomes. That's not to say this is necessarily a bad choice, it's a creative take on the traditional ""whodunit"" method, but it does create a bit of tonal dissonance, and I don't feel like the main character was established well enough to make it work all the way.That said, that's really my only criticism, and everything else is done incredibly well. The shot composition is gorgeous. The dialogue is witty and funny. The movie is quirky and fully embraces the absurdity of itself. The social commentary doesn't get overbearing. The acting's also fun. It doesn't expect you to take the cheesy, cringey bits seriously, which I highly appreciated. Some performances were over the top, but it's very clear you're laughing WITH the movie, not at it.The best part of this movie, I think, is (surprisingly) the amount of rewatch value it brings, which is uncommon for a ""who dun it"" story where you already know the ending. The comedy is very well-done and well-integrated into the story. There are a lot of subtle gags that are easy to miss in the first viewing, like when a shot suddenly cuts to a shaky cam following the main character around that seems incredibly out of place at first, but it actually turns out it was the kid livestreaming on Instagram a second later. Stuff like that is really subtle, shows the creative team put in the effort, and actually makes me want to pay to see the movie again."
"Multi millionaire master of mystery thrillers Plummer has killed himself, or has he. Super sleuth Craig is hired by someone to look into the case.Witty and tricky whodunnit - a perfect homage to Agatha Christie with wonderful characters portrayed very well by a stellar cast / not a single bum note performance. A real pleasure to enjoy a rarely seen genre these days, so lovingly pulled together by Johnson."
"It you like whodunits, you need to check this out. Was sure I knew where this was going within the first half-hour and still enjoyed the ride. Then the story twisted again and again. Fun, clever. Acting, directing and writing are all excellent. One of the best mystery films I've seen in years."
"Wow! Every single time I thought that the story had nothing left to offer and it seems like I got it all figured out, the plot would through a new curved ball again and again until it simply dumped the entire basket over my head in an exciting finale. The entite 2 hours I kept coming up with new theories and conspiracies as I was absorbed in the experience of mystery, humor and the performance of the actors. After that experience ended, I began to think about what I just watched and thats where everything changed.Knives Out is a whodunnit film so naturally, while I was driving home, I put on my detective hat and began inspecting the clues, details and plot elements. The film manages to skillfully distract the audience from its faults during crucial elements by turning up the comedy factor and speeding up the pace. As a result, you wont even notice the mistakes until the end when you are able to think clearly.What really takes away from all the suspense, mystery and the essence of the film is the political aspect of this film. Instead of being a gritty Agatha Christie styled investigation film, it feels like a Cinderella fairy tale with quirkycharacters. Sometimes, a movie needs to have only one theme. All that being said, I still recommend Knives Out as it is upbeat, funny and most importantly intriguing all the way until the credits. A good comedy to watch with friends or family."
"Knives Out is a whodunit mystery film written and directed by Rian Johnson (Looper, The Brothers Bloom). Starring Christopher Plummer, Daniel Craig, Chris Evans, Jamie Lee Curtis, and Ana de Armas, it is one of the most ridiculously entertaining murder mysteries to grace cinema screens in a long time.One day after celebrating his 85th birthday with his dysfunctional family at his large mansion, renowned crime novelist Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer) is found dead in his study room. The police are soon called to the scene to investigate the causes of Harlan's death and to determine if foul play was a factor in all of this. Joining them is the famous private detective Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig), who has his own unconventional methods of figuring out the situation, much to the chagrin of the other Thrombey family members.With its slick production values and witty dialogue, Knives Out injects so much quirky energy into what is widely considered to be an archaic genre and successfully modernises it as a result. Writer/Director Rian Johnson, who clearly has an affinity for this type of movie, takes a great amount of influence from the work of Agatha Christie, with the singular setting and oddball characters rounding off what would normally considered a surface level murder mystery. In addition to this, Johnson detracts from the usual European vibe of the genre to give the film a considerably more American feel, reminding his audience that the genre is universal and not necessarily restricted to a particular continent or culture.There is so much beautiful visual flair in this film. Each scene felt articulately laid out with such clever use of colour and symmetry. One part of the film's set involves an expensive looking seat with a plethora of knives surrounding it in a circular pattern, which can catch the viewer off guard during some important scenes. This again feels like a callback to the whodunits of decades ago, which implemented the surroundings into the story, making the audience question whether or not certain things played a role in the murder itself.Every character was used brilliantly throughout the story, with each one serving a purpose no matter how minor it seemed. All of the family members have a reason to be involved in Harlan's death and deducing who has the strongest involvement kept the film moving along at a brisk pace. However, to single out too many characters would give away the ending so I will only single out one: Daniel Craig. Craig is clearly having a wonderful time playing Benoit Blanc, who can only be described as a southern US Hercule Poirot. At first, Blanc seems like a total goofball with a funny accent but the further the story advanced, the more it felt like he was a figure the audience could trust at solving this mystery.In conclusion, while whodunits may seem dead to some, thanks to the efforts of Rian Johnson, there is proof that there is still so much enjoyment to be had. Even veteran viewers of the genre may be surprised at some of the twists the film throws at them. I urge modern audiences to give it a chance, whether you care for these types of films at all. You never know how much you may end up liking it in the end.I rate it a solid 9/10"
"What a delightful unraveling of murder mystery mayhem, carefully crafted with witty wordplay, splendid camera work, raucous audience engagement, and a tour de force performance by Daniel Craig (with honorable mention to Michael Shannon).This was a movie that overtly demanded your attention, and you were more than welcome to provide it (although given the PG-13 rating, I do question how it will hold up for minors during the first third of the movie). Rian Johnson made something that could take to the stage someday, and I think it's that kind of audience that this would compel most.To say that it delivered would be an understatement. Every minute of the run time mattered. It had this interesting way in which information was revealed in a front-loaded fashion, and yet still left you with necessary questions that you couldn't dodge, and you constantly questioned with the people around you. This will stick with me for a while, and hopefully also garner Oscar consideration for best original screenplay."
It's a great movie and amazing acting of Daniel Craig and Ana de armas With great directing from Ryan it's a must watch
"One of the more entertaining movies of the year. A well made quirky whodunit.
Liked a lot -
Characters were eclectic, although not too original, but were very entertaining. Daniel Craig's character, as a hired PI, was my favorite. His Southern accent caught me off guard at first. I'm guessing him and Chris Evens took these roles to get past their James Bond and Captain America characters. A nice departure for both.
Very strong acting all the way around, however the lead female actor, Ana de Armas stole the show. She had some great emotional close ups that were very captivating. This is the first movie I noticed her in but I will look for her now in others.
The pace of the file was strong from beginning to end. One of the few films over the last year that I lost track of time and was fully immersed in.
Good for all ages, which was nice since I had a 12 year old with me. All of the family enjoyed the film.So so -
The whodunit kept me engaged until the end, but the plot did have some holes. I was OK with them since they didn't play a big role in the overall story line. Also, the move was moving fast, so I soon forgot about them.Dislike -
One of the main reasons I couldn't give this 10 stars (besides the plot holes) is that the movie had the charters talk about present day politics at the dinner table. I'm very liberal and the message that was being supported was liberal as well, but I go to (comedy) movies to get away from politics. It wasn't needed and was a turn off for me. I thought the movie did the same thing, but in a much better and subtle way, when all of the family claimed that the Latino nurse (the main caregiver of the murdered father, played by Ana de Armas) was part of their family, but couldn't remember where the nurse's family was from (a running joke through out the film as the characters told what happened from their point of view). Or how the family didn't want the nurse to be at the funeral, but everyone claimed to the nurse's face that they voted that she should be allowed to attend (another running joke). I thought these more subtle ways did a great job showing how the family felt about ""the help"", making the more direct approach at the dinner table feel preachy (didn't fit the mood of the quirky comedy). The same is true about one of the characters (the grandson of the murdered grandfather). I won't go into details, but you will get my point when you see the movie. That ways over the top and not needed either."
"I found Rian Johnson's Star Wars film to be disappointing, but I believe in going into every movie with an open mind, and I really enjoyed 'Knives Out'.It's an intricate mystery story that feels clever, witty, and made with a lot of passion and care. An early twist in the plot puts this film on another level, distinguishing it from other murder mysteries and making it a unique experience. The characters are very distinctive, and the brisk pace means that the 130 minute runtime is never boring. The theme of self-made success is also beautifully explored.I found the ending to be slightly rushed, but overall, the film comes across as funny, smart, and unpredictable, all at the same time. Would certainly recommend giving it a watch."
"When you first begin the movie, your thinking hey this character is the murder but when you get to the end you see it was actually someone else. It has twists and turns as well as comedy in it. It's worth going to see and each character has there own motive as well or maybe they don't you be the judge of that"
A great updated whodunnit with a contemporary cast. Super for a cold winter day
"I'm not a critic. I'm a moviegoer. I went to be entertained, and I was. I loved the characters, the Christieesque plot line for a modern day, the dialogue, and the cast. I will see this again, and invite friends. Thanks so much for this movie."
A Moderate Paced Setup Turns Into a wonderfully woven tale of intrigue and mystery. I enjoyed every minute of it. It was suspenseful and well played. Two thumbs up.
"Generally speaking you tend to find more murder mystery TV shows than movies, this is partially since it's hard to build a complete mystery in the allotted movie running time.
This movie builds this murder beautifully by showing the different points of views of the suspects. It has a different take than other movies since it gives the viewer a little too much details mid-movie which leaves you questioning everything to the last minute.
The acting was brilliant and I didn't feel the number of characters was overdoing it at any stage."
The rating is low.. due to it being very predictable and being overrated.. you can guess it within half and hour or within 45 minutes max.. and even if you didn't it gives you hints halfway.. and even if you didn't find it till the end.. (seriously) you're dumb.. You're actually dumb.. i can't express it even more explicitly.. the casting itself is obvious..It doesn't feel like a whodunnit.. really.. i didn't feel the twists.. i didn't get the ohhh factor.. if you can get me..A perfect popcorn or netflix entertainer for sure.. but.. not as a masterpiece.. not really a perfect whodunnit.. I'm just disappointed.. really.. i expected alot and i didn't get the end result.. maybe you should go into this movie with lowest expectations possible..
"I loved this movie, very clever! It reminded me of the Agatha Christie Poirot or Miss Marple movies. I can't wait till it comes to the small screen so I can see it again!
My only complaint was Daniel Craigs accent, I'm sure it was deliberately referencing someone but I am not sure who?"
"Rian Johnson's Knives Out takes cliches from murder mysteries and utilizes them to new effect. It's intricate, funny, and unexpectedly fast-paced while utilizing a hardworking all-star cast.Rian Johnson: I'm one of those people that really loved The Last Jedi, so there were certain expectations for me going into this movie. Needless to say, Rian Johnson shattered those expectations. He wrote a complex yet good-natured murder mystery, giving you the clues throughout the story before pulling the rug out from under you. I know that expression is extremely overused, but it's really what happens. He set up expectations for what this movie was supposed to be and crafts it to be something completely different. It's Agatha Christie meets Clue meets Crime and Punishment and I love every gut-busting second of it. The best part is that on a second viewing, every single thing has a different meaning; and every second meaning promotes dual characteristics.The Cast: Every single member leans into their characters with enthusiasm and fully commits to the roles. Daniel Craig is wonderful as the lead detective, constantly on the line between parody and real-life Sherlock Holmes. Chris Evans plays directly against his Captain America, clearly having the time of his life with it. Jamie Lee Curtis plays ruthless like no other, constantly protective yet always on offense. Michael Shannon plays a little bit into his type but ultimately shines through; he flexes his range, going from improv king to terrifying in an instantly smooth transition. Toni Colette plays comedy like no other; she somehow appropriately and sympathetically plays a spoiled rich person. Everyone else in the cast melds together perfectly. The standout of standouts is Ana de Armas. She blends drama and comedy deftly, taking her character on a wonderfully original journey. She sells every second of it."
"Knives Out is perhaps one of the best pictures of 2019. The strongest point is, without a doubt, Rian Johnson's script. The dialogue is so biting, smart, and outright funny that I, someone who falls asleep in movie theaters, couldn't help but to sit on the edge of my seat. The recurring misidentifying of Marta's ethnicity was a clever joke laced throughout the movie and brought to light at the most natural and creative moments. The cinematography is breathtaking, my favorite being the scene in which the Thrombleys learn that Marta will gain all of Harlan's assets. The transition from the stationary shots to the chaos-reflecting, hand-held shot following Marta fighting through the swarm of the family is brilliantly jarring. While Daniel Craig's accent is a bit odd, it fits his character as the classically stereotypical detective in a whodunnit. Chris Evan's performance as a smug killer is a refreshing take from his all-American, goody-two-shoes Captain America, proving his versatility. Knives Out is a brilliant film that I recommend to anyone and everyone."
"This movie was close to a future classic, but there are a few areas that it fell flat in. First the good: it was very well acted(of course!) it was beautifully shot, it was Funny!, the mix between humor and action was balanced
The bad: the mystery side of it was shallow and very easily foreseeable, they could have built up a better sense of suspense and made it a real ""who done it"", the humor was absurd and over the top sometimes(depending on your point of view could be good or bad), the political message was weird and heavy handed in the end, it managed to avoid being too political until the finale. When it is broken down as moral message it didn't really make much sense at all. If it was a better mystery I would have given it an 8, if it got away from political blah blah it'd probably have been a 9."
"I went to see this movie last weekend with a friend, and I've got to say that I had fun. There were a few parts that had me laughing pretty hard. When the movie was over, I felt underwhelmed. It's obvious who the killer is from the start of the movie which makes it predictable. The cast is outstanding and I love that each and every one of them has a very distinct and unique character! Yet, overall it was just lacking. Spoilers ahead: truthfully I don't think that Chris Evans Character killed his grandfather. Yes he tried to, but in the end, it wasn't him. But that's just a theory.., a film theory. Anyways, this movies a fun time but I wouldn't recommend going out and spending money to see it. Just wait for it to come out on dvd. Plus if Chris Evans character really did kill his grandpa and I hadn't been told a sequel was in talks, I would have rated this a few stars lower."
"This movie isn't bad but it's not good. I didn't get my hopes up and I was still disappointed. The Director and Editor both did a pretty good job constructing and piecing the story together. However, the Director did not do a great job with the camera. . The actors did their best but again, The Director failed to use them in the right way. It also comes with a disjointed mix of politics and attempted clumsy messages.Skip, wait for tv"
"Saw this movie based on the generally good reviews and because I am a fan of Mystery/Detective movies. Unfortunately, it is just another liberal propaganda movie - illegal aliens good, white people bad. The acting is average, the ""mystery"" non-existent and the script is predictable. There are no laughs even though it is billed as being partly a comedy. I can only assume the good reviews are from people either trying to curry favor from Hollywood or people who agree with the liberal message."
"Even though the movie takes place into this house for the most of its duration, it wont make you feel tired or bored. Not even for a single second. The plot is so smart and funny and the acting is so marvelous that will keep your eye and thought fully sharped. Of course the finale is not easily predictable, but is completely relatable with the story and the familiar personas. No random side roles to answer the ""whoddunit"" question.
Totally recommended whether you're a mystery lover or not.
P.L"
For me the end was plot twisting but felt extremely anticlimactic as I would expect out of a mystery movie. 6/10 stars
"For all those who didn't like The Last Jedi (and still might be interested in seeing this), there is some good news and bad news. The bad news is that some of the elements people didn't like in TLJ are still present, the good news is that the worst of them are either toned down or are much better served in an original mystery than in an action adventure with an existing IP, such as the need to ""subvert expectations"" or to show off how Johnson's cleverness (the script is cutely clever cute, but not as brilliant as it thinks it is). The final twists seem a little over-written and not without plot-holes, but honestly that's fairly standard for the mystery genre.This might be better appreciated by those who can't get enough of these kinds of murder mysteries, although the film changes genres several times, and stops being a murder mystery for a long portion of the run-time. A key reveal is made so early on (end of the 1st Act?), that the mystery to me at that point was more ""Where is this movie going now?"" than any curiosity about what else was going to be revealed regarding the murder.Acting is pretty solid across the board , although the all-star cast is somewhat underutilized and disappears for long stretches of time. This very structure unfortunately strongly hints towards later developments, even if you can't predict the fine details.I didn't find the movie to be a laugh riot, with just a few jokes here and there that land (the rest of the theater was silent for most of the film as well), but there are fortunately no cringeworthy jokes a la TLJ's prank-calling or milking scenes.This might sound negative, but the film is entertaining. The payoff at the end is good, but your mileage may vary about whether it was worth the two hours of set-up."
"First of all, I know this is weird to start out with but the musical score, composed by Nathan Johnson, was amazing and helped bring people into that old school murder mystery feel. The music sounded like it came straight out of an old mystery movie. The acting in this film was well done by everybody but three people really stood out to me. The first-person being Chris Evans, who plays Ransom Drysdale. He's mainly known for playing Captain America and this role showed people another side to him that I really hope we get to see more of because he played this character to perfection and I just have to say this because Marvel geek but somebody needed to tell him to watch his language. The second person is Daniel Craig who has a weird accent in this movie that needs time getting used to but it doesn't take away from this marvelous performance. One thing that I love about mystery movies is the detective's process of figuring out the case and he delivered on just that. The last stand out is Ana de Armas, who plays Marta Cabrera. This movie could have easily lost me but she was one of the main reasons I kept interested in this movie because she brings so much to this role that it captivates you and want to try and help her out. Now, I will say this if you can easily pick up on things then this might not be the movie for you because after the big reveal happens you realize all of the clues that you should have picked up on and face palming, personal experience. In the end, Knives Out is a great movie for everybody and I do recommend seeing it. But, like I said if you can easily pick up on things, which I usually can but due to the annoying person next to me I couldn't, then you might not enjoy it as much."
"SEE ABOVE - Amazing movie, give her credit.If you have read an Agatha Christie book, post a review.I read After the Funeral a few months back, hard sledding to say the least. But immediately recognized this PG-13 remake. Ms. Christie knee how to make heads roll.My rating is 9, more like an 8.5 because no move in IMDB cracks 9.0 for the long run. Just enough to say it's above an 8.0; no fractions available here folks."
"Before I start, I have to say that at first, I was hesitant on watching a film directed by Rian Johnson. I was disappointed after seeing The Last Jedi, and so I slightly lowered expectations, even with a good score.
What I noticed right away is that the casting was excellent despite it sounding unusual to be in the role based on their previous roles. The characters are likable despite their actions because each of them have their own unique characteristics.The story is a straightforward murder mystery but it's not as serious as others. There is a lot of humor in the movie and it's not one of the cringey ones. This is one of the funnier films of this year and most of the audience including me had a good laugh.How everything is setup and executed in this film, especially character introductions, flashbacks and reveals were well done. It's not generic. I highly recommend it, even if you don't like the director or these types of movies."
"Wow! I just got out of the theater and I can honestly say this movie was absolutely perfect, there was humor that wasn't forced, pauses that weren't rushed, all connected with brilliant sound design. This is an absolute gem and I 100% think that is deserves a lot more praise than I have been seeing in reviews.I want to start by giving props to the editor, this movie really allowed for pauses to build tension and create a very slow burning rhythm that compliments the story pushing both the stylistic and narrative components to further heights. However this is also a direct result of the preparation and execution of Rian Johnson and Steve Yedlin when it came to the production process. They use delayed whip pans to really give a very unique whimsical feeling when watching the film, this along with slow zooms and low angle shots advance the audiences perception of the cinematic world. Also I would like to add that this film has more ways of filming someone walking down a hallway than I thought possible. I think that it is important to also bring up the actors performances, I have to admit that after watching the trailers I dreaded seeing Chris Evans in his role as a deviant troublemaker because they cut out the most out of context lines creating a very cringe trailer but after seeing the film this couldn't be farther from the truth. He really broke out of his Captain America phase bringing a very noticeable stage presence, but Ana de Armas stole the show. She proved that she is not just a supporting actress giving a both developed and mature performance. It didn't hurt staring alongside the established actor Daniel Craig.With all that being said I am rating this film a 9/10 because the final product is a fun experience that has something for everyone."
"Rian Johnson's Neo-Noir debut successfully emulates the tone, that of which presumably influenced, Agatha Christie's Murder on the Orient Express. The farcical and intricately written script combined with an iconic and wonderfully curated cast creates a cinematic mystery venture that is not to be missed."
"Being someone who has devoured all of Agatha Christie's work, I thought this movie would be fun. I was not dissapointed! A great murder mystery with so many references to Christie, Sherlock Holmes, Murder, She Wrote etc. If you like a good murder mystery, watch this ASAP!"
"Waste of time and talent. A nonsense plot that will make you DIE waiting for this to end. Ive heard of actors/actresses doing a movie for a lark,this is defnitely one of those."
"A fun movie. I suspect writer/director Rian Johnson of attempting to sneak in a political message, but if so it is completely drowned out by the noise of merrily preposterous whodunnitry.Daniel Craig is a very good actor, so he gets away with being miscast as a Deep-South detective. Everybody else is effortlessly perfect, but it's really Ana de Armas' movie. She's excellent as the nurse to an uber-successful author (Christopher Plummer) whose family assembles for a get-together which was never going to turn out well. Ms de Armas' endearing rabbit-in-the-headlights quality belies a brilliantly controlled performance.Lots of delights elsewhere. Great to see Jamie Lee Curtis, Michael Shannon, Toni Collette and Don Johnson enjoying themselves so much. Interesting to see Chris Evans out of his Captain America uniform. K Callan has very few lines but reliably steals every scene she's in. And there's Frank Oz, delightfully deadpan, plus a cameo from the mighty M Emmet Walsh.It's designed, filmed and edited with enthusiasm. Nothing to dislike, really. Undemanding entertainment."
This was an excellent movie. I loved Daniel Craig's acting !!
"Knives OutI really enjoyed this movie.This was a very old style who-done-it in very much the style of Agatha Christie's Hercule Poirot, we had a many stranded labyrinthine plot unravelled slowly by our hero detective followed by a denouement.This was very much a talking movie with little action of any kind so if you are looking for a car chase resolution this is not the movie for you.Daniel Craig did a fine job as Benoit Blanc, the drawling accent did not slip once and he dominated every scene, the whole cast did a good job occupying their respective stereotypes.It must have been good as try as I might I couldn't predict the ending."
"This is my new favorite movie. All the suspense built up trough out it made the ending spectacular. It is one of those movies where you do the detective work yourself and wait till the end to see if your right. Every character got interviewed and you have to put it all together like a puzzle. 10 out of ten, would recommend it."
"Idiots like Jeremy Jahns and the legion of fans he brainwashed into hating Star Wars will hate this movie because it's Rian Johnson and they're still salty over The Last Jedi. People like Chris Stuckmann, Jared Buckendahl, LC Screen Talk, And myself will actually look at this movie through the lens of actual analysis from a filmmmaking perspective, unlike that hack Jeremy Jahns. This is one of my favorite movies of the year and don't let dumb salty Star Wars fans like Jeremy The Dictator Tell you differently.This is a witty script from Rian Johnson, with well thought out characters. It is witty, funny and eccentric. I loved every minute of this movie.Salty Star Wars fans like Jeremy will automatically hate because it's Rian Johnson. They need to grow up"
"A little confusing, but, so are all great murder mysteries. I'd give it a 10 if it were an uplifting film."
"Knives Out is one of the best movies i have seen this year. Fantastic, unpredictable story. Kudos to the writer(s) who created this high-class drama full of interesting characters. Knives Out displays Riveting Acting from the All-Star Cast. Jaime Lee Curtis is as always in top form. All did AWESOME. Even the supporting stars shine. An Ensemble like this is not easy to find at all. Yet, you will see major Hollywood names here doing their craft superbly. To me, this movie should win Oscar(s). In short, Knives Out did not disappoint me. I bet you will like it too. I just tell you one thing: pay attention to every detail and listen the dialogues and exchanges between the characters. There are clues in there, though the writers threw some curves aiming at confusing you in a good way. You have to watch and think, mi amigo(a). For example, this line: ""You did this."" After you have enjoyed the movie, you'd know what I mean. Seat Back, Relax and Enjoy the Show."
"If you like a good old fashioned whodunnit then this is for you, quite simply
spellbinding great acting and a clever plot ! how the cinema should be ! Bravo"
"The mystery writer Christopher Plummer has died. Although the police have just about wrapped up their investigation, his nurse, Ana de Armas is nervous; she knows that she had given him the wrong doses of medicine, the antidote was missing from her bag, and he had slashed his throat after arranging with her an elaborate charade so she would would not be suspected. The family and police were satisfied, yet here is the great detective Daniel Craig, holding it open. He has been hired to investigate, although he does not know by whom. The plot thickens when the will is read, and the heir to Plummer's vast fortune is Miss de Armas.Once upon a time, the movie theaters ran full programs of selected short subjects, a feature film, and quite often a second feature. The second features were generally lower-budgeted movies, meant to be rented out to the theaters at a flat rate, and often genre films.... like mystery films. Some of these second features were series, and quite popular; it was no unknown for people to go to a show specifically for the second feature, a Sherlock Holmes mystery, or a Charlie Chan mystery, featuring stars who perhaps did not shine brightly enough for the major studios' A pictures, but would bring in the customers.Eventually, the program shortened: no more selected short subjects, no more second feature. Nowadays, a movie show usually consists of a feature film and previews of coming attractions. Yet, long as it is, and with such a varied and interesting cast as it has -- Chris Evans, Jamie Lee Curtis, Michael Shannon, Don Johnson, and half a dozen others -- this movie strikes me as a B picture, with an ornate plot, some small and gratifying witticisms.... in short, a superior example of the form.If you are wise enough to see this movie, you will be sorely confused, as mystery is piled atop mystery, and how to untangle them all. I know I was. At the end, all will be revealed, and the journey from start to finish will have turned out to be worthwhile."
A 45 minute mystery stretched out for two hours! You can figure out who's innocent within the first 30 minutes! This story is so 'actuel' the political/social overtones are unpalatable to the plot. If the average viewer fails to notice this - then they are in a coma!Plot - a death has occurred in a 'manifest destiny mansion'. And Daniel Craig as inspector 'Benoit Blanc' is hired to investigate. (Personally I think Craig is being groomed to be the Louisiana version of Hercule Poirot). But that phony southern drippy bougainvillea accent is very nerve wrecking. Please don't!The mystery is good but the process to solve it is needlessly long.
"Really fun movie, always keeps you guessing. Masterfully acted. Daniel Craig is surprisingly hilarious. Well shot and the jokes we'll placed."
"Seen a trailer for this back in the summer & couldn't wait to see it.After watching I have to say the film was really well done! The story was enticing & the twists were good! I loved the whodunit theme in this & the clever story telling also!Daniel Craig especially done well among the other actors in this film. It's the second time he plays an american with a southern accent!The film centers on a Cluedo like murder which has taken place among a family in a large house. But all is not what it seems with the death & with the detective on board, shocking revelations surrounding the mysterious death come to lightThough the film did take a while to get going & was a bit hard to understand at first, the film was ace once it did get going!Overall a great watch! 8/10"
Why in Gods good earth would you use an English actor to play the part of a southern version of Columbo!?!? It was horrible. It would have been a thousand times better to have Monk star in this movie. I couldn't wait for this movie to end. Holmes and Watson was more tolerable at least you knew going in it was a crap movie with half hearted attempt to act. Craig probably thinks he did a good job. Yuck.
"Being a big fan of mystery novels and films, I was really looking forward to watching this movie, and was not at all disappointed!
While set in modern times, the film has a really timeless feel to it, similar to the stories by Agatha Christie. While the formula is familiar; rich dysfunctional family living in a big mansion, all with secrets to hide, the twists and turns are quite surprising.
The entire experience is engrossing, and, while the story did not quite go where I initially expected, the ending was great, and actually smart. The whole thing was also really funny at times, adding to the whole entertainment value of murder mysteries.
Daniel Craig, playing detective Benoit Blanc, really goes to town on his role, with a southern 'accent' I never really heard before. Ana de Armas really shines in this movie as well, and the ensemble of great actors playing the eccentric family members all made their screen time memorable.
I highly recommend this movie."
"The movie is not for the average movie goer. The amazing way the movies set up scenes and actions of the character, is not average and not easy to follow. But, the plots and twist are all so well done. The movies valences laughable moments and mysterious drama perfectly. Notability, the most memorable performances go to Chris Evens, Ana De Armes and Daniel Craig. All characters play an importance role- as everything connected and flowed together."
"Looking at the cast and trailer, I was really looking forward to this. Had never heard of the director before, so open minded. Basic idea was promising, but it just wasn't that funny! One person in the cinema clearly found it hilarious (maybe that was the director?)
I found it too long and kept waiting for a spark to ignite it. That didn't happen but two hours looking at Daniel Craig isn't entirely time wasted!"
"The ongoing repeats on UK television of Poirot, Miss Marple, Midsomer Murder etc illustrate a still healthy interest in the 'suspects gather in the library for the unmasking of the criminal' genre and box-office returns in the next few weeks will indicate whether it's one thing to watch in your living room gratis but another to schlepp to the multiplex and shell out good money. My first impression at the opening, as the camera tracked through the grounds of Gotrocks Manor, then entered and trawled past paraphernalia like that seen in Mank's adaptation of Sleuth with Caine and Olivier was that we were in Rip-Off Central but whereas Sleuth was a two-hander here we have a matching set of suspects aka red herrings to banish all thoughts of rip-off. It's well done, glossy, slick but ultimately empty as an election promise."
"Rian Johnson's latest creation brings life to a genre that is dead - murder mystery thriller. The talent on screen captures the narrative, with sharp and witty dialogue, perfect directing and incredible pool of talented actors especially Danniel Craig, it makes this movie phenomenal and entertaining. It is the most entertaining movie i have seen all year.The main highlight of the movie is Danniel Craig's scene stealing performance which capture your imagination.."
This movie is definitely not worth seeing. It is probably just as horrible as The Last Jedi
"For the most part, I'm not a Rian Johnson fan. But I loved this movie for sure. I enjoy a good mystery and this is no exception. Throughout the whole movie, you do not know who did it. Even when you're analyzing, the answer doesn't become clear. There's plenty of twists and crime-solving. You get a sense that everyone isn't being very truthful. And sometimes it's just really funny. Do yourself a favor and watch it; please.8.8/10 (Great)"
"This movie does not involve capes or ""IP."" It is not a sequel. It is not adapted from a novel. It is not an art house flick or Oscar bait. Which begs the question...how did it get made? All I know is Rian Johnson just proved it is still possible to write and direct a great genre film that is self aware but still takes its story and its characters seriously (and even manages to make some points without trying too hard). The cast is great. The homages to classic murder mysteries are fantastic. The humor is both hilarious and subtle. The twists are just right. I hope EVERYONE goes to see it because EVERYONE can enjoy it. Here's hoping more filmmakers (and studios) are willing to tell these kinds of stories. In an era where most blockbusters feel derivative, sometimes originality is just telling familiar stories really damn well and making them feel new again."
There need to be more movies like this. It felt like I was watching a game of Clue being played out and it was just fun the whole time. 10/10 would recommend for anyone who wants to see a movie they will enjoy.
"When I saw the preview, I thought it would be good. It is great. Old fashioned WHO DONE IT. With great actors."
"Bravo Rian Johnson, you made a great murder mystery that had me laughing at 1am, and even tugged on a few heartstrings. One of the best films of the year, and a hell of a way to close out a decade. Better the second time too!"
"The film takes the whodunnit and spins it on its head, giving you that answer in the first fifteen minutes. So you think it's now a whydunnit And yet it remains a whodunnit. And a whydunnit.
Lovely performances by the entire cast. But it's so cool that in a place like Hollywood, such a stellar cast can come together to play roles while a newcomer takes the lead role. Doesn't happen in India.
Nice to see Daniel Craig out of the Bond franchise every now and then. Along with Captain America.
Tight edit. Tight sound. Beautifully shot.
Tight script. Well made film."
What a phenomenal movie! Everything from the visual effects to the music just made this movie move fluently. I absolutely loved the tactics from the detectives. The casting was also well done as it made myself and the audience to never look away. This was an (A) performance!
Not sure how this film has managed to get anywhere near to an 8 - it is a very dull film that thinks it is cleverer than it actually is! Not a case of Whodunit but more like Whocares.
"Hercule Poirot would be scratching his head after watching this very clever film and the ""little gray cells"" would be going around in circles! You'll be scratching you head too on the way home! This is one of the best mystery murders I have ever seen! ENJOY"
"Just saw the AMC advanced screening of this film, and it was extremely well done! The story did start off kinda slow, but it picks up quick. The acting is better than expected even with such a talented cast, and it was well written, although it did feel like Toni Collette was trying too hard. There was no ""mcguffin"", no surprise character introductions in the third act, and everything was up front at all times. There was no ""secret"" piece of information introduced at the last minute that would give everything away. The ending caught me off guard not so much because of the who, but for the how of it...All in all, it is a brilliant mystery that balanced story, plot, and humor without compromising on quality. Daniel Craig could very well have another hit franchise on his hands if they were to create additional cases for him to solve. This is provided that the same quality in terms of writing and story is adhered too."
"I was able to see an early access screening of this, and it was amazing! It is so layered and unpredictable, with a great cast and great directing. Go see this when you can!"
"This was such a fun whodunnit that was pretty hilarious and well acted. Chris Evans and Ana De Armas bring such powerhouse performances in this film. The dialogue is witty and well written, there are twists and turns that I did not see coming. I think Rian Johnson is not as clever as he thinks he is, the script is solid and pretty tight, but in the end it's nothing different from what we've already seen before. I suppose that's my biggest issue, I'm not sure I'd say it's a different take on the whodunnit genre like some others have said, because in the end it's just the same old trick. The message and the commentary in this film was pretty obvious, ham fisted, and heavy handed. There are some other elements to the story that were stupid, but other than that it was a thoroughly enjoyable film with an amazing cast, great acting, a solid script, and pretty good directing."
Funny. when you think you got it figured theres always a little more. This is definitely worth the watch
I loved this film. I found it funny well written with some interesting takes on the whodunnit theme. Daniel Craig is hilarious as is his accent. The ensemble cast are excellent. So refreshing to watch a CGI and super hero free movie. I really don't get why people are hating on this film so much. I loved it and I don't even get paid for writing reviews.
Daniel Craig steels the screen in this witty Whodunnit that most likely the critics will hate but what do they know.Daniel plays this Quirky Detective Benoit Blanc with what I would say is to applomb with a deep Southern accent who is assisting the local law enforcement in the investigation of the murder of a well known mystery writer. With a supporting cast of Jamie Lee Curtis and Don Johnson it will keep you guessing till the end if the police or Blanc will get to bottom of their joint investigation.Me thinks if this is successful then it's a green light to see Daniel as Detectivie Benoit Blanc again!
"I just got out of Knives Out, it was a packed screening at 11am on a Wednesday.Once again Rhian Johnson pulls the old bait and switch, I went to see one movie, but got another!! Oh how this guy loves subverting expectations!!It's hard to say if I liked it or not, as I was disappointed to not get the all star, murder mystery ensemble I had been promised in the trailers, but I did enjoy what I got though, and I laughed a few times. I'd say it's a thriller more than a murder mystery. Oh and it has a political message too!! They are not subtle undertones, they hit you over the head with it.All of the big stars have don't have that much screen time, Daniel Craig probably has the most, whilst Jamie Lee Curtis has the least, Ana de Armas gets the most screen time, and she is hardly in the trailers.The cast are all having fun in their roles and its hard not to enjoy yourself when they are in screen, but I'd have to say Ana De Armas is the best one here.I can't get into what I didn't like too much without going into spoilers etc, but all in all I enjoyed it for what it was, instead of hating it for what it wasn't."
"Good movie, good cast. Great suspense. No action, so action lovers might not find it interesting. Story has a good twist."
"This movie is fun, I enjoyed it a lot and I wasn't too sure I would based off the negative reviews I read on imdb. The movie kept me wondering the entire time."
"Okay, I really enjoyed this movie however, I thought the movie would of been more intense like the girl with the dragon tattoo movie.Awesome move with great humour. I couldn't watch it again though."
"This homage to Agatha Christie is Rian Johnson's first film since ""Star Wars: The Last Jedi"" (the only other one of his films I have seen, which I thought was alright but not great.) I love Agatha Christie as well as the cast of this film, and was looking forward to an entertaining and darkly hilarious homage to classic murder mysteries. While the film has some laughs and moments of sharp writing that make it a somewhat entertaining diversion, it unfortunately feels less than the sum of its parts.The initial setup is simple: a popular and acclaimed crime novelist is found dead, with a slit throat, right after celebrating his 85th birthday in his mansion. From there, anyone related to him could possibly be a suspect. The film's first act is really strong, with great production design of the Thrombley family mansion, a good score and clever use of musical cues, sufficient character development, and some snappy and well-paced writing. After that, though, things start to get rather uneven and anti-climactic. The acting is generally good, although none of the characters get much of a range. While there are pockets here and there of good dialogue, the film's numerous attempts at political and social satire feel very hollow and forced. There are a few recurring juvenile gags that get annoying after a while as well. Parts of the film are quite entertaining for sure, but overall I'm not certain how well it holds up in its entirety or whether it really lives up to the rave reviews it has received. 6/10"
"If you saw the marketing material for Knives Out, it pitches you on a classic whodunit. All of the characters have something to hide, things are often not as they appear and there's going to be a big twist at the end. Some of these elements are in Knives Out but this is a rare case in that it looks like a whodunit, sounds like a whodunit but is actually something else. They don't go the expected route and they reveal the nature of the crime much earlier than you would expect them to. It was a nice choice to subvert expectations, I was a little disappointed but they brought me around on it by the end. So adjust your line of thinking going into Knives Out, you might think you have it figured out but trust me when I say ""THE GAME'S AFOOT.""We also get a classic setup for the characters motivations, it was a nice blend of what you expect and something new. A fortune is at stake, everyone has something to gain from Harlan's death and when the shoe drops, no one is completely forthcoming. There's some depth given to all the players, I was surprised that Michael Shannon or Toni Collette weren't given more to go off of but we learn enough about them to understand why everyone is a suspect. I did get a little annoyed with how everyone was constantly lying or snickering when Blanc looked away, it shifted my thinking into suspecting many parties being involved when the reality was much more simple. There are so many red herrings that it was tiresome to keep up but I do think the ending delivered the desired payoff.The cast of this movie doesn't compare to the Avengers or you're average Marvel team up but you're going to recognize most of this cast and they've all given memorable performances in other films. I'd classify Daniel Craig as the lead and he's pitch perfect as Blanc. He gets the opportunity to be a little more laid back and comedic compared to James Bond and between this and Logan Lucky, he's got the range to pull this off. I really enjoyed the energy he brought to his character and I tip my hat to him for stretching a little in Knives Out. Ana de Armas gets the next most screen time and I thought she was good as well. She's dressed down and the role is much less glamorous than something like Blade Runner 2049 and she appropriately adapts. She's decent at being mousy and reserved and she added a lot to this movie. Chris Evans is in the cast, he's more sarcastic than when he's playing Cap but this was a nice return to a more Johnny Storm or Jensen character. But he also has to get serious and if you haven't seen his more dramatic work, he's more than capable of that and he delivers. Christopher Plummer was in the movie more than I thought he would be, he's a theatrical treasure, of course he was great. The rest of the supporting cast gets less to work with than you would think, they all get their moments but they're collectively good as opposed to 1 or 2 standout performances (all of them were good at giving the shifty-eye and twirling their respective moustaches).The best setting for a murder mystery is always a big mansion on a dark and stormy night. Knives Out has that classic kind of flavour, it isn't afraid to steer into tropes while avoiding others. I really liked the setting, it was fun and there's a lot of atmosphere despite the movie only featuring a few locations. The house becomes another character on the screen and this can be important in helping bring you into this world. The movie is shot well on top of this, the costuming and the set dressing is what you would picture in a game of Clue (it was referenced in the movie), it was only missing a ball and a character in a tuxedo. It's edited and scored to grow the tension and even though I would describe it as more workmanlike than fantastic, there were few missteps or problems which is a credit to the movie.I was pleasantly surprised by Knives Out. Despite the overwhelmingly positive critical response, I was happy to catch this when it was on streaming services. A friend of mine was eager to see it though and I'm glad he convinced me to go. I'm glad Rian Johnson got the opportunity to bounce back (I don't want to comment on the Last Jedi, my review is on the site and the screaming of opposing opinions on both sides about The Last Jedi robbed me of my enjoyment of Star Wars, thanks a lot for that everyone). I like a good murder mystery but I have a hard time reading the genre due the trope heavy kind of writing it requires. This carries over into movies but I have to admit when they're done right, they can be breathtaking (Gone Girl, A Simple Favour are both excellent movies that have come out recently). If I were looking for a comparison, it shares a lot in common with Murder on the Orient Express (the 2017 Kenneth Branagh directed movie) and I would pick Knives Out as the better effort. The cast looks like their having a blast, the characters are diverse and mysterious, the story is engaging and features enough curve balls to keep the reveal a mystery and the setting is a fun old school throwback that I enjoyed as well. Knives Out is a fun couple of hours at the theatre, its not a towering achievement in cinema or a masterpiece of screenwriting but its a well thrown change-up leading into the December ""award"" season. I'd rate Knives Out between a 8-9/10 but I'm going to round down until I see it a 2nd time, I don't know if it will hold up as well to repeat viewings. If you're interested, I'd recommend checking it out in theatres"
Personally I really Enjoyed this movie. Anna De Armas deserves an Oscar for her role in this. The screenplay was very whitty yet its end was a little predictable it doesn't take away from the good in this movie.
"Really enjoyed the film. great cast, great characters. Nice plot twists novel approach. Masterfully directed, well edited giving all the ensemble characters they can get their teeth into. What starts as a simple murder mystery soon turns when us as viewers get all the information we need right at the start of the film.
Spoilers bit, sorry;🙏
I did think it was a bit heavy handed the way none of the family knew the country Marta was from leading us to the fact although they keep telling her she is part of the family very few know even the most basic details about her life.
Over all I thought it was a fantastic ride, go see it, enjoy it and avoid the haters. Cheers."
"So first I'll start off by saying this is spoiler free! With that said, I loved it, great story, pace, and overall acting! I thought the movie was going to be one way, based on the promotional material, but I was mistaken. The movie isn't the typical whodunit but it is rather a beautiful twist to the genre. What I loved about Knives Out was its finely crafted and very thought out storytelling, lots of surprises with a strong sense of mystery. I must say Daniel Craig stole the show, but for me everyone was brilliant. The movie had great charm about it, but the ending really helped bring the whole movie together. My only real critique is the legality of the final outcome, but I'm no detective (you'll know what I mean when you see it). I highly recommend this film and would love to see it again to catch more my second go of it! Go see Knives Out, you surely won't be disap""pointed!"""
Anyone that has rated this movie before seeing it is something that you should have as a question IMBD?!??
"A friend and I drove out of town to watch the Galaxy Quest documentary and saw Knives Out as well. Worth the drive! Funny, superbly acted, keeps you engaged the whole time, it hits all the high notes. I'm planning on seeing it in the theatre again. Do yourself a favour and go see this!"
Nice twist in the end. Acting is excellent and a great story!
"Rian Johnson's ('Star Wars: The Last Jedi') ensemble juggernaut 'Knives Out' is a cutting edge whodunnit with lots of witty one-liners and twists, an underlying political sneer at modern America, and first-rate actors that will both shock and surprise you.As soon as the classical music kicks in with the murder scene draped in fog, you know this is going to be a unique watch for 2019 audiences. What seems to have been a suicide, suddenly becomes a murder investigation on the death of renowned crime novelist Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer), as more and more testimonies don't line up, and private detective Blanc (Daniel Craig) and Lieutenant Elliott (LaKeith Stanfield) suspect foul play. A classic murder mystery turns into a contemporary case of Cluedo that keeps the twists coming, even when it seems like the main secret has been revealed in the first act. When more skeletons seem hidden within Thrombey's manor and his dysfunctional family, that's when the fun really begins.Johnson most recently directed the hated-by-a-huge-percentage-of-fanboys 'Star Wars: The Last Jedi' (which I personally adore!), but isn't holding back on his writing skills. As a matter of fact, it seems like he's even louder than ever and that truly pays off. His construction and build up of tension and suspense is astounding. Most of 'Knives Out' takes place in the enormous mansion, which by the way has some of the craziest production design I've seen all year, yet Johnson takes the story far beyond the mansion on a few occasions to bump into the clues the main suspect has been trying to hide from everyone involved.The cast is stupendously incredible. Rambling up such a mix of well known talents with exciting new faces, is a genius combo. Front and centre stands Cuban actress Ana de Armas ('Blade Runner 2049'), as Mr. Harlan Thrombey's caretaker. Showcasing a range of emotions throughout the film, she's certainly the strongest of the cast and an exciting talent that will most definitely have people talking. The caring and emotional Marta Cabrera, is a unique character I haven't seen in a film of this calibre for a while. Her innocent persona evolves through all stages of grief, showing she has a heart while most of the late Mr. Thrombey's family members are vultures with no shame. Johnson has proven many times before how to flesh out his characters, and has done it again.Daniel Craig ('Spectre') and Toni Collette ('Hereditary') surprise as on screen comic relief. It's refreshing to see Craig, who's best known for James Bond, take a different route in his career to prove he's not a one-trick pony. Collette, who at one point channels her Hereditary dinner rant, is a camp riot as daughter-in-law Joni. Everyone is great in their own part, just Jaeden Martell ('It') felt more like a minor plot device and has no place in the whole of the story.'Knives Out' is a hoot of a film! Cuts right into the action and slices through two hours of giggles, shocks and spins. This might not be for everyone, Johnson has quite the outspoken opinion on racism, political standpoints and what's right and wrong, and might challenge those who don't agree with a more evolved point of view on humanity. The film is most of all engaging, and Johnson is just the right guy to make one the most entertaining films of the year.Originally published on into:screens"
Interesting 1000+ male and 200+ female reviewers. Why is that? And what do you think the breakdown of the 300+ haters who voted a 1 is?Beautifully written and directed movie. Very entertaining. Great production design.Enjoyed my mug!
"Here we have-again- the perfect example of a great film being undermined by haters who regard the flm from the perspective of his work on the Star Wars franchise. Let's get this out of the way and let me make clear that the only good parts of the franchise-according to me-are the original trilogy with Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford. So I presume that the lowest ratings here were from the SW fan community. ""Knives out"" turns out to be a mix of ""The Royal Tannenbaums"" and ""Hercule Poirot's Christmas"". Just like Meghan Markle who's in for a lifetime of unnecessary comparisons with Diana, you'll inevitably-if subconsciously- compare Craig to David Suchet. Here we have a rich patriarch in his mansion cramped full with all sorts of exotic paraphernalia; a dysfunctional family, each with his own motif to do away with Dad. He is brilliantly portrayed by Christopher Plummer, determined and clear-minded even in the face of his own demise. The only one who seems to genuinely care for him is his immigrant nurse Marta Cabrera, and after the will is read, it turns into a witch-hunt against the unexpected beneficiary of Harlan's fortune. There are delightful details, like the ornamental assemblage of knives in the background of the chair in which members of the family are seated during the questioning. There's Benoit Blanc , a dapper detective on his own quest for the culprit. He's played by Daniel Craig who clearly enjoys showing us his capability for comedy and something beyond James Bond. Cabrera's inability to tell a lie without throwing up is at once brilliant and cliche, but her overall performance shines throughout the whole film-not that she lacks in serious adversaries, like the larger-than-life Jamie Lee Curtis, a charismatic businesswoman who proudly exclaims she ""built her business from the ground up"", which her son Ransom (a handsome and funny Chris Evans) dismisses as a million-dollar loan from Grandpa (a subtle nod to Trump). Harlan's attempt to discredit his flesh and blood as blood-sucking losers is also a challenge for the the viewer-albeit not a really difficult one, but that's not really the point here. The mystery is like a baklava, layered in parallel mysteries to be deciphered. Daniel Craig isn't David Suchet-but on the other hand-he doesn't attempt it anyway, and we can see that he did succeed to build an autonomous, authentic persona, admittedly with a much more pronounced inclination to humor. Which is definitely a good thing. The perfect example of this is a scene where he informs Ransom that his ""ancestral"" family home was in reality purchased by Grandpa in the 1980s. ""Knives Out"" is definitely value for money, whatever the haters say. Let's hope more directors will tap into whodunnits. Not just because I have a soft spot for Poirot and Sherlock.Don't believe the haters!"
"Makes me wonder why we don't get many murder mysteries anymore, hopefully after this we will.An all star cast with some very good acting make this a film will work watching for a good plot with plenty of twists but also sprinkled with comedy right through out.I don't want to give anything away but I felt it came up just s little short of a classic but I really enjoyed it and would recommend it to anyone."
"As of writing this on 11/30/19, this movie has over an 8 rating....and that is just BAFFLING. It tries so hard to surprise and shock, yet none of the twists are surprising nor shocking. Movie's with over an 8 on IMDB are reserved for the upper echelon, the absolute best of the best. This, being generous, deserves a 6 out of 10 (I'd rank it at a 4 out of 10). The only reason I can see it getting more is because people want to see themselves as artsy and cinematic experts. It's a bland murder mystery with a good cast that is WAY too long and never delivers on any front."
"Let me just say that given all the press around this movie and cast interviews, etc...I had a pretty good idea of who killed Harlan. But the way it all played out was not only very clever but very entertaining as well. I thought Michael Shannon was a bit underutilized here as I happen to love him, but otherwise no complaints. Ana de Armas truly is the heart and soul of the movie and you definitely root for her throughout. As for Chris Evans...well, he was phenomenal. I actually prefer his non-Marvel work (Gifted, Street Kings and Puncture are some of my faves) and this one really shows off his acting chops in a huge way. I'm waiting for him to get the respect he deserves as an actor not just for playing a superhero but for bringing a depth and believability to his roles that is very unique. In short, see this movie NOW. I'm going to see it at least one more time in theatres to try and see if I can spot any clues throughout that I may have missed the first time."
This movie is a must see for all lovers of the mystery genre. Rian Johnsons direction and screenplay are some of the best all year for sure
"Masterful work, this is my second favorite movie of 2019, only after Parasite. Rian Johnson has cemented himself as one of the most interesting directors working today and earned my full attention for his future works.Knives Out is not only the best of its kind, it also brought fresh new takes on how to approach the whodunit genre. The story is intriguing and the pacing is near perfect. As expected from this amazing cast, the acting is good to great through and through, with one of the best performances of 2019 from Daniel Craig. Extremely happy for Ana because thanks to Blade Runner 2049 and this, she's very much on her way to be a superstar. Rian once again bathed his film in stylistic cinematography, making it one more cut above other movies. I can keep on talking about the tight writing, the atmospheric score, the dynamic camerawork, the non-stop twists and turns, but I suggest you go and see this brilliant piece of art yourself."
"Knives Out is a who done it mystery thriller directed by Rian Johnson. The same director who did The Last Jedi, and has garnered an infamous reputation because of that film as well as his reaction to fan backlash. However, this movie is much more in Johnson's wheelhouse than Star Wars. He excels in more grounded thrillers, which is what this film is. Rian Johnson is a competent director if given the proper material.This is the first mystery thriller of its kind to come out in theatres since Murder on the Orient Express I believe. I liked that film better, but Knives Out, while not great, is a fun time with a stellar cast. You have amazing actors like Daniel Craig, Chris Evans, Jamie Lee Curtis, and Michael Shannon. Daniel Craig and Chris Evans steal the movie for me, mainly because I love those two as actors. If I had to pick Daniel Craig is the stand out performance here. Yes, his southern accent is over the top, but I think was intentional. Ana de Armas does good in the movie as well. I like her in Blade Runner 2049, and I like her here too.The film is very well shot especially inside the family mansion, which looks fantastic and gives off a great sense of style and atmosphere. Being inside this house gives you the feeling you're watching a period movie, even though it takes place in modern day. Unfortunately, the outside shots don't invoke the same kind of atmosphere.This film, for a who done it story, takes a very interesting turn. It starts out as your typical who done it mystery. But then it gives you significant info early on to make you think you who the culprit is throughout the entire second act, only to spin it around again at the end. It really plays on your expectations. Though, if you were expecting a more straightforward mystery story this might not be for you.The film does get a bit slow in the middle. I'm not saying those scenes didn't need to be there, but I'm just saying the second act is slower isn't as interesting as the first and third acts. Plus a couple of the characters feel pretty stock and disposable.Overall, Knives Out is a fun mystery flick. It's not a masterpiece, but it's style, cast, and character interactions make it a fun time at the movies."
Not sure why I went in with low expectations but wow this movie really impressed me. It had everything and was one of the best if it's kind in a long time
"Mystery movies can certainly be fun, but the refined art of mapping out a crime can be a challenge in this world with ever shrinking attention spans. However, there are still writers and directors out there ready to give it a try in hopes of bringing thought out plots back into the popular trend. Tonight's review holds such a promise and even more so it holds another redeeming trial for a director whose involvement in Star Wars was not the best received. With lots of advertising, I'm sure you have seen the trailers so let's get going as I review:LIKES:Acting
The Cinematography
The Plot Is A Good Mystery
Better Twists Than Anticipated
Involvement With Most Of The Cast
The ComedyDISLIKES:
Some rather worthless characters
The Run Time
The Pace
Perhaps A Little More MurderThe VERDICT:With an assembled cast such as this, you can best bet the acting will be at least moderate, and for me it was a fantastic display of work. All parties assembled really play the dysfunctional role well, portraying the motive filled shouts and complaints to an art that did not annoy or go overboard. Too many names to place I'll say that Craig was entertaining in his role of Colonel Saunders (a running joke) meeting James Bond as the detective, primarily in his interactions with Marta. Ana de Armas was the star for me not only because of her character, but more so in the way she played the levels of emotion perfectly and interacted with the squad the most to balance this art. Past the acting, the movie really picks up in terms of the visual presentation, feeling much like a detective movie from the 50s-80s, but modernizing it to the present day. It should captivate many mystery lovers, but more so generic fans who can point out a lot of devices and nods to famous detective sagas. However, the movie's main selling point is the presentation of the story that let's face it has been told time and time again in a Hallmark like fashion. Johnson, for me, accomplished the role of bringing out a good mystery, not only in the classic hunt for clues and mapping out suspects, but adding some nice twists to the mix. If you are paying attention to time and some info, you'll start getting an idea, but this film's twists (no matter how convoluted) do manage to spruce up the dusty manor of detective works. An even better angle for me, is the character utilization, while not perfect, every character has a purpose in some form or angle, with few sitting off to the sides as just mere bodies to fill a convenient hole or bridge. If not for the sake of the plot, then the character was used for comedy and that may be my favorite part of this movie. Knives Out manages to be very humorous in the regards of the comedy aspect, with well written dialogue, delivery of those lines, and timing wrapping up nicely to leave many laughing during my showing. That I feel will be a pull for many audience members, though don't expect usual slapstick, banter, and ridiculous, logic defying stunts to be pulled here, or you'll be disappointed.For such an artistic film though, there are still a few things I would have liked tightened up. Though all characters were utilized in some form, I can't lie at least three could have had more involvement than what they did. Hinting at being a part of the plot, these characters were left to the passing comments or joke props until that one moment a clue contributed. That family engagement they sold in the trailers, needed some more development for me to keep everyone entangled in the mess as opposed to on the side. In addition, the plot could have used a little more murder and threats to help spice up the drama/mystery, as I am partial to the deadly games of hunting in my movies, than anything else. For a movie selling that murder, I had kind of expected something else, but it's a mere trinket. I can say the thing I had the hardest time with was the run time and the pace. Knowing it's a Johnson movie, I expect it to be long, and for the most part the movie ran at a good enough pace that it did not feel super long, but other times did show the dragging I dreaded. I can say that there were parts that could have been cut out to shorten the length, or at least rewritten to include the character interaction I mentioned above.So in conclusion, what are the thoughts on this controversial movie/tale. To be honest, I do think it is a reimagining of Clue, and took a step into the modern world to help reach out to the new audiences. It's got the presentation of a mystery, with twists to help bring our well-acted characters together and entertain us with their drama. Comedy is also pulled out of the sheath and I think these two elements are the biggest selling factors to brave the nearly 2.5 hour run time Johnson has put forth. As such, I feel this movie is worth a shot at hitting the theaters for those looking for a drama/mystery/comedy, while others will most likely enjoy from the comfort of their homes.My scores for Knives Out are:Comedy/Crime/Drama: 9.0
Movie Overall: 8.0"
"My husband hadn't heard of this movie (outside what I told him) but knew I wanted to see it and surprised me with Early Release tickets. We went last night and it was just a fun time at the movies and a happy diversion from all the holiday prep we've been doing. Don't regret going at all (like you do with some movies).Knives Out recalls the days of the black and white PI movies and the television shows of the 70s and 80s, while bringing the genre firmly into the modern age.It felt formulaic at times. That said, there were enough surprises to make you laugh, think, or even cringe and that keeps it from being too predictable! We were delightfully surprised that we couldn't figure it out completely. As one reviewer said, the tie-up wasn't quite a surprise (the Who) but the rest (how it all comes together) had some elements we were surprised about.It walks the line between brilliant new Whodunit and tongue-in-cheek throwback parody. There are enough references to previous renowned PIs (without shoving them in your face) to make it feel almost a parody. Especially with quips like, ""CSI KFC"". Yet, they have created a unique Whodunit in wonderful style that mostly keeps you interested.There were points (especially in the middle/middle-end) where I felt it dragged a bit, but it picked up again quickly and we were drawn back into the story almost as soon as I realized I was getting restless.I personally think the actors were the best part of the whole thing. I realize they are actors and this is their job, but it seemed like they were having a ball with their typecast/stereotyped characters. Most notably, Daniel Craig and Chris Evans. It was pure joy watching them enjoying their roles so much. You could feel their fun coming off the screen. It didn't hurt that these are roles we don't relate to these gentlemen often so it was such delicious fun to watch. (Seriously, good-guy Captain America to spoiled Trust Fund Playboy? He had so much fun with it.)Overall, it probably won't end up in my top 10 favorite movies. At the same time, if it's on, I'd probably watch it again and again."
"I found the movie to be a good balance of mystery, story, and acting. Each scene did it's service and progressed the story as needed. Daniel Craig was brilliant and I must say he has grown on me considerably throughout his career. Ana de Armas was a standout in her role. I've never heard of her until now but she was great. I felt the 'big moment' could have been bigger but maybe that's just me. I quite liked the soundtrack and I did some googling after as a couple songs stayed with me. The cinematography was well done and the overall execution of the film was worth the trip to the theatre. Two thumbs up... I recommend the popcorn as well!"
"This is the type of movie you say when someone asks you for a recommendation because it is for everyone( movie lovers and casual viewers)
In the sea of sequels, reboots , ... this is truly a breath of fresh air.
I haven't been so entertained in cinema for a long time.
Suberb intelligent script( Oscar nom is coming) and brilliant actors make this a must watch for everyone.
p.s. there are really interesting techniques, some seen for the first time or rarely in movie history"
"The feeling washed over me of just how nasty the film actually was. It is both literary poison and too obsessed with getting good grades to get its hands dirty, bridging the polarities with an aloof and misanthropic superiority. It wants us to hang it on the fridge. Problem is the effect is more like a brother hitting the other then crying he was hit back. The film takes Trump America and splits it with left v right, within this dishonest frame of neutrality while his agenda couldn't be more clear. Of course, he's too passive-aggressive to be forthright. Then the patriarchs epiphany is as if Scrooge lost his mind; but even Scrooge stopped short handing Cratchit his fortune settling on giving him a duck. Today the artistic acts of millionaires must be greater because money is twice as shameful. So it's about capital and globalization. The transfer of power is societal and economic and race is a funnel of that, a symptom, a copout, an excuse. She becomes Queen. The world is now a different guard--now this could be effective as do you break the code and go with rage the hyperbole entertains and provokes. Poison is fun. We love a murder mystery. But I'm not sure Rian Johnson in his great position quite knows what he's trifling with, attacking the giant bodies of society through the frame of the erudite whites v underclass. Rather society is a disguise for his personal grudges and failures, then it all makes a little more sense. I think he's obsessed with internet culture. I think he's furious Star Wars fans came at him and he made this film as some grand revenge saying, 'I get the last laugh trolls.' Knives out, plainly. The film is then a tantrum from the very wealthy 'white male' he seems to be sending up, for how the others didn't take his blockbuster properly, so let's destroy the world. Its pettiness is a kindness I offer because the alternative is even worse, and that is its politics. Because if there is honesty to this piece it is that he belongs firmly within the family ranks, not directorially outside of them. He hides, per usual with his oeuvre, through deceptive frames, one-upping and manipulating us with narrative trickery doing anything he can to avoid giving us a sincere experience. We're just there for Rian's entertainment. As he's incapable of anything but frames (a common trap for the midwit) we are suddenly forced to see Johnson himself as the frame--the ultimate irony they don't quite learn is the more you hide the more we see you. So the director as moral arbiter hides in the 'statement', its politics and the personal are so fused, they are echoes, holograms, projections of the other, then relishing hurting wicked people can only be an act of artistic sadism, same as Plummer. Then, the film's dishonesty is it never questions he was a lousy father who raised these very kids he's chosen to punish. See the indignation of the brother speaking of the sister: ""Self-made? She had a million dollar loan"" inadvertently damns Johnson who goes with no self-reflection, mercy or pity at all within the mud-flinging. Constantly it's saying they don't deserve it. They botched it. They didn't earn it. Did you, Rian?"
"Writer/director Rian Johnson has taken a classic whodunnit mystery and revamped the genre into a romp full of comedy and charisma, but remains loyal to the puzzle-solving demands of the genre. We can imagine Agatha Christie giving a thumbs up from her grave.When the patriarch of the Thrombey family, mystery writer Harlan Thrombey, is found dead from apparent suicide, the family comes together in hopes of inheriting the writer's riches, while, at the same time, an investigation into the suicide is being performed.From the very start we see the brilliance of the film as the camera speeds through different areas of the Thrombey mansion, highlighting Harlan's written works and collected antiques. We get to know the writer with these subtle depictions, and we infer that we are about to meet a snobby family. Although 'snobby' is an underlying subtext, the family we meet is full of eccentricity and quirkiness. Each member of the family provides something new for the palette. It's like sitting at the dinner table and enjoying a twelve course meal. And there's plenty of dessert with Daniel Craig playing the lead private investigator with the flamboyant southern accent, the mismatched pair of detectives, and the home nurse Marta, played by Ana de Armas.One area where the film detours from conventional storytelling is in showing us how the death happened at an early stage. We are then invited to figure out what is the relevance of everything else happening in the story. What emerges from this is a very satisfying unfolding of events that does not leave us feeling cheated. But beneath everything, we see issues that afflict most families and their particular members. There are the haughty ones that boast in the glory of seemingly raising a family to a higher social status. There are those that remain in a family simply to leech benefits. Then there are those that are not satisfied with what they've been given, and feel they are deserving of more. These issues produce a field of combatants that disrespect the blood that binds them, and the Thrombey family is a clear example of that: when they don't get what they want...the knives come out.In my opinion this is one of the year's better films with a stellar cast and a solid script. The younger audience will probably be bored (as were the rambunctious teenagers sitting in the same aisle as us), but for us older folks we'll be entertained and probably reminded of certain individuals that make up our family!Overall grade: A"
"The people who gave this low reviews are prob those who get bored with a lot of dialogue.I, for one, found his film and absolute hoot!"
"There are so many things I love about 'Knives Out', but possibly the one I love most is that it proves if your story is strong enough then you don't need gratuitous action sequences to pad the run time and keep the audience entertained. 'Knives Out' has one brief car chase that doesn't have a lot put into it (even the characters reference what a terrible car chase it is) and that's it. The rest of the movie is just the story unfolding. And yet it is so gripping that it is one of the best paced films of 2019.The cast in this movie is incredible. It is all-star and everyone in it plays their parts perfectly. I have to give special mention to Daniel Craig though. I haven't often liked Craig's performances outside of the 'Bond' series, but here he is truly fantastic. The accent he chose to go with took a little adjusting to, but by the end of the movie I couldn't imagine his character without it. He was a pleasure to watch on screen.This is one of the smartest movies I've ever seen. Every detail is laid out masterfully. It's a movie you could watch 100 times and you'd still be picking up on new things. Add to that the dialogue, the characters, the foreshadowing and the humour it manages to extract and you have yourself one incredibly fine film."
I really enjoyed this kind of mystery movie. Well written script. Very interesting to watch.
"KNIVES OUT MOVIE - Rated PG-13 for thematic elements including brief violence, some strong language, sexual references, and drug materialWOW what a huge cast, Daniel Craig with a southern accent - ha what a stretch, that added comic relief throughout the film for me.
It opens with a policeman interviewing each sibling or family member of Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer) who is now dead, was an interesting introduction to each character as they were questioned, but boring to me with the same chair and back and forth memories in audio and not visual! Its a twisted who-dunit murder mystery like an Agatha Christie, with a today's touch. The film has many of those Christie tropes of a detective warning us about foul play, marking everyone a suspect, and setting up all of the clues in plain sight. It all comes down to 60 million in cash, a publishing company and the mansion that everyone believe they deserve, or at ""least their cut"". The ""trump troll"" and ""some"" lines open your eyes and smile that this mystrigue is not set up in the past, but today. Yet the characters, screen set and back-drop are in no way, anyone I know of, and I've met many many people. The short political subtext thrust the audience into today, but also a narcissistic home and selfish family your glad you dont really know.
It has an all-star cast - I was happy to see some of the ""old"" stars back, Christopher Plumber - the Father, Don Johnson - who plays a son, Jamie Lee Curtis - daughter, Micheal Shannon, - is a son, ( that has a Trump loving son played by actor; Jaden Martell - and I found that to be a funny satire because the actor, Micheal Shannon is a big mouth progressive liberal). Toni Colette - daughter, Daniel Craig - the investigator, and Ana de Armas- the nurse care giver of the Father. ALL were funny and great in acting especially Ana de Armas who I dont really know but look forward to seeing her in another movie soon. All except, Toni Colette she was TERRIBLE, spewing lines as puke, over acting, she was worse than the 2 German Shepherds that were cast in the film. Every time she was in a scene she ruined it, deflated the energy and believability, constantly unprepared off tone and pace, I would not hire her to narrate a elementary school science film, BUT ENOUGH about her.
Each Character's history and perspective of what happened to the Father (murdered) because of their personal past and recent interaction with him, is Lived-out from the past memories initiated by the verbal back and forth questioning as Daniel Craig the southern Investigator keeps searching. All are waiting for the big ""surprise"" The WILL reading, that shocks the characters and family members, but not the audience. I almost fell asleep, and just smiled no laughs, good acting except Toni, (as I mentioned earlier) but the plot was not a surprise, so I give it a C. If its raining and you've got nothing else to do, wait till its on tv and boor yourself then."
This is a really fun movie. I was expecting more of a comedy but I wasn't disappointed at all. Phenomenal cast overall and Daniel Craig rules. His over the top accent is perfect and I'm really glad Lakeith Stanfield is getting a lot of work this year guy is great.
"Wow just wow what a fun film ! Lets just appreciate the fact that a studio took a chance and made a film like this !!! This is exactly the reason why people go to the cinema to watch films, to have an experience like this. This film has everything in it and it can be viewed by anyone of any age, this film is not focused or marketed at any one demographic. Anyone can go to see this film and have a great time ! To the people who doubted Rian Johnson's ability after his last film, we all know what that was, you have definitely been shown to be wrong !Rian Johnson is and has always been a great director whether you like all of his films or not, the man is an incredibly talented director and writer. The film is shot brilliantly but I knew that going in, Johnson knows how to put a film together ! For me the more amazing part is the story and the script................top class from Johnson, such an elaborate story with some many twists and turns all the way up to the very very end of the film!The cast is sensational, just list the names off is quite amazing itself. How one film can have such talent by itself is a testament to Rian Johnson, because all of theses actors clearly read the script and signed on straight away ! I must say that everyone in the film is brilliant Don Johnson, Jamie Lee Curtis, Michael Shannon and Toni Collette......the list goes on. However there are three performances that are just that little bit better, firstly Ana de Armas. What an interesting role for her to take, for me I think its a little out of left field but she really works well in the role.......her first proper leading role??? Such a likeable character..............you really do want to route for her. Although her character does have a ridiculous complex...... at first it seems stupid but as goes on, actually really works!! Quite central to the plot as well! Next is Daniel Craig, with just the perfect accent for the character. It must have turned heads the first day of shooting this film. He is so good, I hope that after he has finished with the Bond franchise next year we will see more of him in roles and films like this!! I think he is an underrated actor..........Lastly is Chris Evans, now this is a complete surprise. Who knew that he could play a villain so well, I suppose getting so accustom to him playing the good guy in a particular film franchise so long for, sort of stereotypes him. But towards the end of the film he comes into his own and steals the film.........a second viewing is needed for all the little hints.Faults of the film.................There are none!Overall this is a very good film 80% out of 100, Rian Johnson proving all the doubters wrong.........why there were any in the first place is beyond me!! Just such a good time watching it, cant wait to watch it again, definitely one of the highlights of the year. Cast is fantastic but there performances are built upon a brilliant script and story...........that has every genre of film wrapped up in one film."
"""Knives Out"" puts a new twist on the classic ""whodunnit"" mystery story. It is very entertaining and enjoyable, combining equal parts suspense and comedy. The dialogue is witty, the plot is (mostly) original, and the cast is superb. The
""Clue""-esque setting and characters are mostly enthralling. This film will satisfy most casual and hardcore moviegoers alike. However, ""Knives Out"" doesn't exactly break any new ground. It isn't revolutionary as a movie, or even as a mystery. It works hard to be unique, but stops just short of breaking away from similar films. Also, some political banter slightly taints the movie, but doesn't ruin it. All in all, ""Knives Out"" is definitely worth a watch, maybe even a re-watch with friends, but it fails to become one of the greats."
"This would be a nice whodunit, Agatha Christie-like mystery film with Daniel Craig as a modern-day and Southern interpretation of Hercule Poirot with a few good jokes and good twists and turns.
But that would have gotten it a 7 or 8 rating from me.
What makes this movie one of the best of the year is the underlying message.The movie begins with self-agrandizing introductions of the family members. The rich family who like to think that they have ""built everything from the ground up"" are really a bunch of failed or delusional characters that live off the fame and fortune of the family partriarch.
Jaime Lee Curtis is the closest thing to self-made you get in the Thrombrey family, but later we learn she got a million dollar loan from her father (sound familiar?) to get her started. Then there are Joni and her lifestyle brand and Meg with her liberal arts studies, the first broke and the second studying something useless in real life. Both living off Harlan. Alex at least is honest about his life and entitlement and his dependency on his grandfather. However, it is ultimately revealed that he would do anything to not have to earn his own Lifelihood.The contrast to Marta, the Hispanic nurse could not be bigger, she is a kind, loyal, hard-working and compassionate person and the only real friend Harlan has at his birthday party.It is through her honesty (she even has to throw up when she lies) that Marta ultimately prevails over the dishonest family. In the course of the mystery she almost always acts morally sound and shows genuine emotion faced with all the crazy turns of the story.
The family pretend to have let her into their lives and several times call her ""family"" but none of the know which Latin American country she is actually from calling her everything from Brazilian to Uruguayan and revealing how empty their words are. Their actions after the will is revealed show even more starkly that they never saw her as part of the family. Even Meg and especially Joni, who seem to be less racist (at least in a discussion about the Trump administration) turn their backs on her as soon as their own inheritance is involved and their earlier professions of empathy with Marta are revealed to be superficial. Meg even uses the information she has on Martas mother to pressure her.Ultimately, when Captain America is arrested for the murders Marta was supposed to be accused of, when all the self-aggrandizing colapses into itself and the pure-hearted and now rich Marta looks down from the balcony on the brats that wanted to ""protect their ancestral right"" to the house and fortune, you really see the similarities to an ever.more isolationist America that looks to the past for greatness and violates its own values to protect the wealth the current generations didn't even accumulate. It is the best depiction of the current state of affaires I have seen that is also funny and entertaining. And that gets my 10 stars!"
It's definitely a different type of movie probably not what you're expecting when you walk in at least for me it wasn't but I really did like the story the only thing is it felt short to me
"I came for this movie looking for a laugh but ended up satisfied, nevertheless. I don't think this movie should be under comedy. The funny moments during the film could be counted on one hand, two if really pushing it. However, it excels as a whodunit movie. I was surprised when the movie's main mystery was solved halfway through. I thought that was it. However, it unlocked another impressive twist. The things that are left untied are tied and many clues make sense at the end."
"The trailer is a lot more fun than the movie. it's like ""murder on the orient express"". if you liked that, you'll like this. chris evans might have a career after super hero life. he's pretty good here."
"I love murder mystery genre and this was no exception. I'm with another user never go by the stars given. If it hovers in the 5* range after few thousand then it's a dog, but this movie was rated 6.8 after a few hundred and now look at it 8.1. Good popcorn movie."
"I generally don't like Rian's work that much, but this movie was good. It was competently done, well acted, had decent humour and put a nice spin on the whodunnit genre. It's one of the few examples with his work where I can actually get behind some of the expectation subversions because they actually make sense and don't ruin the established tone (unlike The Last Jedi). In fact I had no idea where it was going after the first act because it took the mystery, told us what happened (which I won't spoil) and then turns into more of a general mystery of double crosses and character motives that culminate at the end nicely. Also it has Chris Evans telling people to eat s!%t, so what's there not to like about that?"
"Saw the trailer for this movie and though it would be funny, but after seeing it opening day it truly is a masterpiece, almost like a modern day clue and trying to piece together all the stories and motives."
"The plot was Great and amazing Humor of The Cast. It very good mystery film who kill the father//owner of the house.The plot twist was very well done and i wish the ending should have different ending who kill him like Glue film; which I love that film also. This was very entertaining and fun to watch.
My review🍗🍾9.5/10 IMDb 4.5/5.0 stars🔪"
"Just saw it and I can't wait to see it again! What a wonderfully clever and twisty little whodunit! Great cast and superb direction from Rian Johnson who has yet to make a bad film. Beyond impressed with this one. Once it starts it just keeps going and it just flies by with a very snappy pace and clever twists.It's a shame a lot of the really negative reviews for this film are coming from a certain immature old men still whining about a certain space opera sequel that came out two (2) years ago. (A film that is also objectively amazing, might I add). None of their criticisms, frankly, make sense. Guess some people will always be angry inside. Sad.Oh well! If you can, I would highly suggest seeing this in theatres. It's one of those films that's so much fun to see with an active audience. Get your Knives Out!"
"This movie is great for multiple reasons but I'll stick to my main two.Reason 1: every character is memorable. They all had something that made them ""them"" you feel me. Even the young kid who barely has any lines is funny. Chris Evans and Daniel Craig are stand out roles. Chris Evans finally gets to play an diff instead of the always righteous patriot and Daniel Craig is just the best detective I've seen in one of these movies. You have your guys like the poirot from the recent adaptation of ""the murder on the orient express"", those aren't fun detectives. They're shallow characters written in the early 1900 that haven't evolved with time. Daniel Craig in this movie however is a very funny, likeable but also smart detective.
These characters feel real. They're not some pawns in a game of cluedo they're actual personalities. There characters aren't based on their occupation but on how eccentric they're. It's not ""the cook"", ""the Maid"" and ""the doctor"" but its ""Marta"", ""ransom"" and ""Harlan"". (Harlan btw, great victim. He's such a nice guy and I hate it when shows and tv make the victim of crimes a bad guy because the audience wouldn't feel bad for that characters death. That's stupid, that would make a villain an anti hero. This movie makes him instantly likeable by showing his interaction with Marta)Reason 2: Good story. Knives out whodunnit aspect is perfectly executed. It keeps you guessing on who ""dunnit"" (get it) and every time you think you know you get thrown for a loop. While watching I came up with atleast 4 different theories just for them to turn out wrong at the end. It's so good"
"""Knives Out"" is sharp, witty, terrific and tons of fun. Writer/director Rian Johnson has reinvented the genre and assembled the greatest ensemble cast in years.
.
In this murder-mystery film, a family hires a detective to investigate the mysterious death of their father at a family gathering.
.
From the opening frame you know that you're going to have a great time seeing ""Knives Out"". Rian Johnson's attention to detail is so evident here and works out perfectly. You can tell this writer/director has been wanting to make a movie like this one forever. Daniel Craig's performance is probably my favorite of his career; he's incredibly versatile. Ana de Armas absolutely nails it and honestly I think her performance is award worthy. The entire ensemble cast is put to good use which you don't see often in these cases. The twists and turns are so epic you will leave the room floored. Definitely one of my favourites of the year."
"I'm a huge murder mystery fan, and I originally wasn't going to see this movie DUE TO the rating that was on  long before the movie came out to the general public. I'm so glad I didn't listen.Rian Johnson's Knives Out is a perfectly entertaining thriller/mystery movie, with an all-star cast, a compelling and intriguing plot, and a very poor accent from Daniel Craig. That being said, the minor plot holes and slip-ups this movie inevitably has are no excuse to give it a low rating, as its job is accomplished with fluency and elegance. I was interested the whole way through, and even if the ending wasn't the biggest plot twist in the world, I found the first and second act to be even bigger plot twists which more than made up for it.All in all, the movie delivers on an entertaining, not-so-family-friendly mystery that should leave you walking out satisfied. I'm happy to see the movie's true ratings are coming out as we speak and they are getting higher and higher. This is worth your time and money."
I saw this at TIFF and thought it was a masterpiece. Someone should show this to the game of thrones guys as a lesson in how to subvert expectations properly. Its a pity to see such a low score due to the star wars kids being pissy over a 2 year old movie and taking it out here. I hope it becomes a franchise of detective movies.
"I got a chance to watch Knives Out at an early screening this week. And I am so glad I was able to go, because it was one of the best movies I've seen this year. (And that's without my bias towards coming-of-age stories)Rian Johnson writes and directs this movie, and it's such a great job from him all around. You can tell this was written the way good mysteries are supposed to be written - backwards. There are so many good twists and turns that reference things happening earlier in the movie. It's the type of mystery that the viewer can solve, if you're paying attention. And on top of that, it manages to be absolutely hilarious the entire time. The humor is witty. The mystery is a modern take on a old genre. It breaks a few tropes to find it's own path. And it's just an amazing journey.If I start listing actors and actresses who give good performances, you'll just wind up seeing the entire cast list. Seriously, the cast includes Daniel Craig, Katherine Langford, Chris Evans, Jamie Lee Curtis, Toni Collette, Ana de Armas, Lakeith Stanfield, Michael Shannon, Christopher Plummer, and others. And every performance is top notch. Nothing feels out of character. Every character has distinct traits. Every actor and actress understands their character and works towards that. The emotion is real. The expressions are real. It deserves all of the praise it gets.This movie is an event. Take your friends and your family to this movie and I can all but guarantee you will enjoy this movie."
I wanted to see this movie since the very first trailer.everyone involved did an excellent job.sooooooooo many oh sh#t moments in this film.I don't want to spoil it just go see it asap👌
"I saw this film today, and left wishing to see it again in the cinema - a thoroughly enjoyable affair, with a whodunnit with more twists and turns than the Nürburgring.Rian Johnson, who's a filmmaker I've always enjoyed - especially when he can operate without the handcuffs of a franchise such as Star Wars, which is easily the most stifled film to date - and has a habit of writing and directing films that don't quite fit a mold. Brick is a Neo-Noir in theory, but is also not, and Looper is a Sci-Fi that often isn't. Knives Out is a Mystery, but it's predominantly a character study and comedy, particularly with Harlem (Christopher Plummer) and Marta (Ana De Armas).Easily the two best aspects to this story are the contempory nature setting of modern day to contrast with the old school mystery elements similar to Agatha Christie or Arthur Conan Doyle stories to help make the story funny, and also the acting.
Quickly on the film's structure and editing, Johnson does manage to do several moments of misdirection; we are shown the truth vey early in the film, as with several people's recounting stories to the police, but the way that the story twists this is something that I think can be taught in Film School as setting precedents and placing details that people might not notice like a phrase, or a question that gets answered later in an organic way. It probably won't get acknowledged by the Oscars in either the screenwriting or editing departments, but it should be.Acting wise, this film is loaded, but the four main standouts are Daniel Craig, Chris Evans, Ana De Armas, and Christopher Plummer.Daniel Craig, who in the vain of Logan Lucky, gets to do something a bit more funny and different than the James Bond films, and it's clear he really enjoys playing this Kentucky version of Sherlock Holmes, who is simultaneously believable as a sleuth - for he does uncover the whole truth - but is also able to make it not seem like a revelation.Chris Evans, similarly, gets to play a character who is the exact opposite of what he does as Captain America, where plays, essentially, a total tool. However, he's a total tool who still carries himself with a degree of charisma and who is watchable and identifiable - even if its the worst parts of him we're identifying with.Ana De Armas and Christopher Plummer respectively play Marta Cabrera and Harlan Thrombley, and are both the heart of the film. Marta is exceptionally likable, and clearly is representative of similar traits of Harlan - both are people who built their success from the ground up, with Harlan being a self-made millionaire crime writer, and Marta being a daughter of immigrants who works as a nurse. Marta is essentially the main character, and also the only one played by someone unfamiliar to Western audiences, as this enhances her appeal as a hard working person, and likewise Plummer plays Harlan like a man who cares for everybody around him and goes out of his way to help them, but is also firm when he needs. Both Plummer and De Armas could've played these roles as ""throwaways"", but both of them ensure that we're rooting for both of them until the end. Fantastic work by them both.I loved every part of this film, and I may even see it a few more times in theatres - I recommend you do too."
Terrible and unfunny. I don't really get why this guy is allowed to direct movies.
"This boring predictable rehash of an murder she wrote episode, is another social conditioning exercise disguised as entertainment. I gave it two stars instead of one because I like Christopher Plummer."
"I don't understand why people are judging Rian Johnson for just one movie that they though ruined Star Wars(which in my personal opinion it didn't), but maybe this movie can help people come to their senses on how great of a director Rian Johnson is. Cause in the case of this movie, Knives Out is a expertly crafted murder mystery with thrilling twists, a pitch perfect cast, and a experience for everyone to get a kick out of. Almost every twist in this film got me, except maybe the last one but I was a little tipped in assumptions so it still kinda got me. The cast was also perfect, especially Ana de Armas, who does a really good impression of her illness as well as a really good performance overall and Daniel Craig, who does an excellent job as the detective even though he isn't directly in the first few minutes of the film but immediately makes himself central when brought in. The rest of the cast is just as good as those two and their dynamic feels general and absolutely hilarious at some points. That's also another thing I liked about this movie. It's a murder mystery but it doesn't take itself too seriously. I actually laughed quite a bit during this film and it's all just because of the excellent chemistry of the cast. The movie overall is crafted in a way that's quite distinct from other murder mysteries I've seen and most of that is do to like I said this film not taking itself too seriously. Overall Rian Johnson has once again proven himself a confident director by crafting a well told murder mystery with a cast that feels genuine in their chemistry and twists that you will still be thinking about after the movie is over. So to all of you angry Star Wars nerds, maybe this movie will have you look at Rian a little differently.Final rating: 9.6/10"
"Whodunnit films are the ones no one ever dislikes. Though it's a rarity today, Rian Johnson has directed the best of the genre in this decade probably. Every second of the film is interesting and it's one of the few films where twists and turns are actually necessary. Daniel Craig and Ana De Armas have given their career best performances. It would be a shame if this movie doesn't get nominated or win any accolades"
"I have no idea what this movie is all about at first. I blindly decided to watch it cuz the poster reminds me of Kingsman. But boy was I wrong and I'm glad I'm wrong cuz this movie truly blows my mind away. The plot twist and the story truly makes you in awe and curious. Truly, a funny and loveable character expecially Craig's role. Such excellent performance!"
Great escape for the Holiday stress. I laughed and was entertained by this delightful Who Done It.
"Really surprised at how so many people love this movie. Although, all my friends I saw it with loved it too so...
To me the ""twist"" was super obvious from very early on. So then it just was really boring waiting for it to end.
Also, my friends liked the political back and forth but I did not find it engaging or even interesting. Maybe because my own family is very politically divided.
Lastly (and someone else said this in there review on here as well), the main detective was like Kevin Spacey doing Frank Underwood. Which with everything that has come out about Spacey, left me with a really uncomfortable feeling.
Also, fwiw, apparently there's a big Star Wars controversy thing going with the director but a) I didn't know any of that until after I saw it and b) I am not a Star Wars fan, so my opinion of the movie has zero to do with any of that drama."
"Knives Out - When you've been yearning for a murder mystery of substance for years, comes Knives Out to satiate all your hunger. It's intriguing, thick with a plot, has star appeal, is mounted on a lavish scale and is taut. It may not exactly be an edge of the seat thriller, but it has all the commercial aspects that keep the viewers glued on, pretty much like the yesteryear Hitchcock or Agatha Christie novels.When Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer) is found dead in the morning following a family party, everyone is a suspect because each family member allegedly has a motive. The police however want to believe that it's a case of suicide and move on. Enter detective Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig) who has been hired by an anonymous client interested to solve the case, the investigation starts taking sinister turns and no one is spared. The private nurse Marta Cabrera (Ana de Armas) remains a central character as in her lies the answer to a number of questions and she can help take Blanc to solve the mystery.Director Rian Johnson spins an interesting web of lies, smokescreen and deception. There are ample avenues and attempts to steer the viewers away from making intelligent guesses about the real motive and the potential murderer and he is quite successful in achieving the objective. The conclusion and climax are quite unorthodox and uncomfortable. Starring Jamie Lee Curtis, Michael Shannon, Chris Evans, Don Johnson and Toni Collette in very important roles, Knives Out makes for a compelling watch. It will fill you with an appreciation for the runaway story, depth of characters, detailed scripting and screenplay and the rich backdrop. Daniel Craig and Ana de Armas walk away with the honours in the histrionics department and Nathan Johnson must be applauded for the original music. Must watch film for everyone."
"Knives out is written and directed by Ryan Johnson, a brilliant ingenious who had directed the clever Sci-Fi ""Looper"" and two of the most important pieces of TV ever made, ""Ozymandias"" and ""Fly"" of Breaking Bad. In his latest project he clearly poured his heart and soul into a brilliant script that drew a dream ensemble of cast elevating this picture into a level of an absolute masterpiece.Its build as an Agatha Christi ""who done it"" theme around the demise of an old wealthy American novelist in his house on the night of his 85th birthday party that all his family had attended. His family members are kind of parasites that collectively make a highly dysfunctional family. The suicide/murder mystery plays beautifully into a familiar story arc, but is quickly challenged by a new take rarely seen in this genre by throwing pieces of the truth (or is it?) into the plot with surprisingly very easy to follow style of editing, and this elevates the tension and engagement of the viewer to a new enriching level.Much can be said about the clever screenplay, wicked humor, beautiful production design, and the stellar performances, but what really drew me was the story within the story, and the metaphors delivered through this stylistic mystery thriller flick. Slowly you would see that each member of this family resemble something about the modern twisted capitalism of America that makes this ugly gray zone between what this country was and what it truly is. The true American is old and genuine who dies quickly in the very first minute of the picture. He is a writer, an artist, and a true gentleman who held grudges on his family after exposing their true vampire nature and thusly had an affection to the only true human in his house, his nurse, an immigrant from a country (laughably always missed by each family member). The family mostly, yet in a heavily condescending manner, show appreciation and admiration towards the nurse and consider her to be part of the family, much like the attitude of the serial killer white extremist family of Jordan Peel's ""Get Out"". The nurse herself is simple and kind who, as lots of foreigners in this country, are often alienated and reduced by aggression on one hand, and arrogant altruism on the other. Of course, the family is very quick in showing their true colors towards her when the circumstances are shifted, and also very quick in a shameless ""apology"" to her when things shift back, something that feels very familiar nowadays.Each son, daughter, grandkid, son/daughter in law has a unique element of the twisted and manipulated ""American dream"" symphony. The movie sarcastically reduces them into cheating bourgeoises, hypocrite preachers, pathetic beggars, evil thieves, and last but not least, into a mind washed anti-immigrant Nazi teenager. They pretend to be self-made individuals, but in an obvious sarcastic way, they are mere opportunists salvaging from the roots of a true passionate artist whose talent resembles the true American idea. The script doesn't shy away from these definitions, playing a clever game of dark-comedy by shinning the contrast between what America has been, what America is now, and what America should very much come again to be.What makes Knives out a masterpiece is that it has them all, the idea, the script, the performance, the production design, the editing. It is a very funny movie that shifts from the light humor to the pitch dark, a clever and maximally entertaining spectrum. It engulfs its qualities into an engaging old-fashioned thriller mystery, and finally weaves a socio-political commentary that works as a unique American story affected by the latest radical changes in its recent decades. It's an optimistic picture that sends a true necessary message of respect to the old, of criticism to the ""modern"", and to what true America should strive again to be. Without a doubt one the best movies of this century."
"Knives Out isn't a Who Dunnit. It's a How Dunnit. It's a disassembled, deconstructed murder mystery that makes a mockery of the entire genre. Whatever you think is going to happen here, doesn't. That's fascinating. Rian Johnson is a really talented guy. I feared that this film was going to suffer cliches and lulls throughout, but not for a second was I not invested. I loved the convoluted nature of the mystery. The cast themselves help bring it all together. The standout is Daniel Craig in the most gloriously fun role he's ever delivered. It's hammy, it's over-the-top, but that's the point. He plays an old-school southern detective with an unorthodox knack for cracking completely absurd murder mysteries. He puts Sherlock Holmes to shame. The rest of the cast fires on all cylinders. This is the rare instance of an ensemble cast in which everyone compliments each other beautifully. I believe we'd go from a really good film to a great one with a trim of unnecessary dialogue. A few key pages of this scrip hint at a larger political message that doesn't materialize into anything meaningful, nor was it necessary. Some characters are seen, but seldom used, like Lakeith Stanfield as the lieutenant detective. But overall, this movie is nothing but fun."
"Sit back and enjoy: if you like the cast, you will not be disappointed: they clearly had a great time playing off each other's characters. The plot twist was not as surprising as I have hoped for, but there were no dull moments either. I'm glad to see different genres being successful on the big screen - neither every script requires, nor every studio can afford, blockbuster productions."
"A wonderful murder mystery whodunit with a great plot which has plenty of good twists and turns that will keep you guessing right up until the end. The writing is funny and quirky, the acting and cast performances are great, and although it does labour the explanation phase a bit, it's a marvelous production overall."
"One of my most anticipated films of the year totally lived up to my great expectations. The all-star cast delivered a very entertaining film that gave us a great homage to one of my favorite literary authors Agatha Christie, yet managed to deliver an original and exciting entry to the genra. Would not have expected less from Rian Johnson, a writer director who does not know how to make a bad movie. I am so ready for more Benoit Blanc stories and I hope Rian Johnson and Daniel Craig keep them coming."
Its a perfect mystery movie .....with twist and turn
"The ending was really awesome, with a perfect twist that I honestly didn't see coming. The plot was well developed and made for an awesome reveal. The acting from the whole cast was superb, Ana de Armas was perfect as Marta. There was great chemistry between the family members. I sort of felt like the story was slow going and the build up to the final reveal could have been streamlined."
"You might read a lot of skepticism about this movie with regards to it not being original enough, casting known actors to make up for the lack of a story, etc. But as someone who has seen this movie recently, I have to tell you that this is one heck of an entertaining movie. There isn't a single dull moment throughout the sequences and time flies before you realize that you were just getting started with the fun. That to me is the definition of a quality movie. I've always had my fair share of stereotypes associated with the murder mystery noir in a disapproving way but I'm glad I didn't let that get in the way of me seeing this during this 2019 thanksgiving weekend. I'd say definitely give it a watch and form your own opinion as opposed to dismissing it based on pure reviews, casting, etc!"
"A disjointed family returns home upon hearing the news of their elderly mystery writer father's suicide, but was it really suicide? Daniel Craig's southern fried detective has been hired to find out by a mysterious client and he believes there might have been foul play.In Knives Out, everyone has a motive. The cast is filled with some of the brightest and most dependable actors Hollywood has to offer and the pacing never sags for a second. You'll be second guessing everything up until the final reveal. I'm impressed by how little the trailers actually spoiled this time.To say too much about the film would be a huge disservice to those wanting to see it, but I can say that twists and turns abound, no one is who you really think they are, the acting is fantastic, the laughs plentiful, and you'll have an excellent time."
Not a dull moment in this film. Live the sequence of events and how the mystery unsolved. Superb acting of course. And may I say Ana (who plays Marta) should be more in the lead in that cover because she's literally more main than some of the big stars in the film!
"But I guess that's how the structure of a murder mystery goes. The closer you get to solving the crime the more your investment pans out.
It's starts off being humorous from the moment the movie begins, and the laugh out loud moments never end.
Sometimes it seemed like a waste of a great ensemble cast because a lot of people were not doing much but then you realize sometimes it's the little things that get the biggest laughs, it makes sense that the players are all-stars.
I enjoyed the whole thing."
"What a slam on nurses. No need for labels, she can tell the difference between the extremely similar looking medications. This is an attack on the integrity of the nursing profession. Or maybe it is attack on immigrants, thats how immigrant nurses dispense medicine. If you haven't guessed, I am a nurse and my mother was a nurse and my grandmother was an immigrant nurse."
Just been to see an advanced showing of Knives Out. Great whodunit in the flavour of Agatha Christie. All the cast were great especially Daniel Craig . Could there be another with the same character. I hope so. Lots of fun. One of my films of the year. And could be a contender for an Oscar nod for the wonderful screenplay. As for the nay sayers because of the last Star Wars film .......get over it. Even Lucas got it wrong with 2 out of the 3 prequels!!!!
"Saw this tonight at an early screening. The writing is truly brilliant. Everything that happens is for a reason and really shows how much of a masterclass filmmaker Rian Johnson has become. The story is fun and engaging and always keeps you on your toes. The acting is also great. Daniel Craig, Ana de Armas and Chris Evans are standouts. Daniel and Chris are very different characters to what they normally play and that's super fun to see. The family dynamics and politics is on point and hilarious. If you dig murder mysteries, you'll love this. Without going into spoilers, the storytelling is dynamic and I think it treats the audience with respect while also having a lot of misdirection and twists. Highly recommend."
"Here goes Rian again on his ""I know best"" agendas, last time ""toxic masculinity"" this time ""white privilege"" well asians earn more than white people Rian, I don't see you bashing them.1 extra star because past this idiots political agenda smoothed movie there is actually the resemblance of a good movie"
"Rian Johnson is a pretty hot property right now, what with the Star Wars credits, a decent science fiction movie, and so on. For a number of critics, the analysis of the movie ends there.Because this is flat out not a very good movie. The twists are not prdictable - far from it - so incredibly complex as to be completely unbelievable. At the center of the plot is an absolute absurdity. The patriarch of the family apparently committed suicide by cutting his own throat - an incredibly painful way to die - because he thought he had been accidentally overdosed with morphine. Absolutely absurd. Only he hasn't been overdosed because of an incredibly contrived series of events . . .. . . all of which have nothing to do with the various motivations of his heirs to do him in, established in some detail - the most entertaining part of the movie. As the movie goes on and drifts into the detail necessary to make all of the preposterous contrivances work, all this interesting background is completely lost, or ignored.Along the way a police lab is completely destroyed by the simple expedient of throwing an arson device through a window, because you know how insecure those places are. Etc., etc., etc.A splendid cast wasted. This is just not a very good movie."
"I saw ""Knives Out"", starring Daniel Craig-the James Bond movies, The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo_2011; Chris Evans-the Captain America & Avengers movies, the Fantastic Four movies; Jamie Lee Curtis-the Halloween movies, Christmas With the Kranks; Don Johnson-Django Unchained, Machete; Christopher Plummer-The Man Who Invented Christmas, The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo_2011 and Ana de Armas-Blade Runner 2049, War Dogs.
This is a murder mystery in the vein of Murder on the Orient Express-it has a lot of celebrities in it. Christopher plays the eccentric millionaire-among other things, he has a chair with knives all over it, looking like it was from Game of Thrones-and he is celebrating his 85th birthday with the whole family coming in for it. Jamie is his daughter, Don is her husband and Chris is their son. There are other family members-and they are all dysfunctional-and Ana is the care giver to Christopher. Ana seems to be the only one that really likes Christopher. During the night, Christopher is found dead-his throat slit with a knife-and it is ruled a suicide. After the funeral, the police show up at the family home with Daniel-a private investigator-and start asking questions. It seems that it might not have been suicide but maybe murder, instead. Everyone is a suspect with a motive.
It's rated ""PG-13"" for violence, language, drug material and sexual content-no nudity-and has a running time of 2 hours & 10 minutes.
I really enjoyed it and would buy it on Blu-Ray."
I thought it was a thoroughly enjoyable movie with a great cast and some fun twists and turns. It is quite campy and doesn't take itself too seriously so basically Rian Johnson's Clue with some great scene chewing from Daniel Craig and Chris Evans.
"In this politicized whodunit a wealthy family patriarch is found dead in his room. What looks like nothing more than a suicide has an air of foul play once private detective Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig) starts digging into it.This movie is comparable to the likes of Clue or Murder on the Orient Express. At the center is a very astute Sherlock Holmes-like detective and in his midst are many potential suspects.I wanted to like the movie more because it was funny and it was clever. The politicization was a bit off-putting but that wasn't what I took the most exception with. I had a problem with the main character, or at least the development of the main character.Sharing much of the screen time with Daniel Craig was Ana De Armas playing Marta Cabrera, the nurse of the deceased patriarch, Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer). We learned through intermittent exposition that she was the nurse and friend of Harlan Thrombey. We also learned that she was the purest character in the movie and it irked me.While the Thrombey family was primarily self-centered a-holes Marta was so angelic that she couldn't even tell a lie without vomiting. That brought about some laughs, but when combined with her overall character it made her sickeningly saintly. When Harlan predictably left his entire estate to her I kept wondering when she would reveal her true colors because no one is this pure of heart.As a matter of principle, I didn't have a problem with Harlan leaving his wealth to his nurse. There have been movies like that in which an unlikely but deserving character inherits the wealth. But the manner in which Marta was made the heir was too raw and undeveloped. There was not enough backstory and character development between the two of them to make that action a readily acceptable action. We only got a five minute scene in order to see the close relationship between Harlan and Marta, which is not nearly enough. With the absence of several scenes to show their closeness and Harlan's distance from his own family, the willing of his wealth to her was rather flat. It came off as odd or eccentric as opposed to well thought out and intentional. It was thrust in there so abruptly that I was sure Marta was playing all of them.In fact, I would have liked the movie even more if the hardworking, overlooked, and underestimated Latina was playing a role just to get rich. It would've fit far more than the hardworking nurse with a heart of gold that got an inheritance because a wealthy old man took a liking to her.I'm not eliminating the possibility that Marta did play Harlan and the entire family. There was a hint of such a scheme at two points I can remember.At one point there was a scene in which Harlan told Marta that he did what she told him and cut them all off. It was a brief exchange but it could have been a hint that Marta was pulling the strings.Then there was the end when she was sipping from the mug which read, ""My House, My Rules, My Coffee""-- it could have been her smug, ""I just played all of you"" moment. But it was hard to tell.As murder mysteries go, this was decent. You come to expect the unexpected so I wasn't blown away. The cast was great, if only the flawless character wasn't so flawless."
It's a cute way to pass 2 hours when your bored. Nothing special about it but enjoyable
"Knives Out is a great time through and through. Rian Johnson expertly weaves his mysterious threads to create another fantastic addition to the whodunit genre. The cast joyfully embrace their roles, radiating a playful energy throughout the entire film. Just enough structural changes are made to the classic formula to make Knives Out feel fresh and new. A few flat jokes and one minor limp reveal cannot ruin what is otherwise one of 2019's most enjoyable films."
"This was the best movie I saw in years , finally a magical cast with a spectacular story"
"Knives Out has the perfect balance for a film in all components. The cinematography is beautiful, the plot and character development completely pull you into the experience, every single actor was the perfect choice for the film, and it has some really great comedic moments to keep you wanting more. I don't have a single complaint about the whole thing. I thought I knew what to expect going into it, but I am so happy that I was wrong with my initial expectations. This movie is a must see."
"Rian Johnson's always been a strangely divisive filmmaker, and for the life of me I can't understand why. Not just The Last Jedi either (though that's the most obvious signifier of this), but I remember Looper getting pretty heavily criticised by IMDB users back in 2012 (check the top rated reviews- a lot of the highest ranked ones are still incredibly negative).Knives Out, however, is much more likely to be a crowdpleaser. It's incredibly entertaining and very breezy and accessible, and I don't say that as a negative. Not every film has to challenge or provoke or depress its audience to be considered great... though that being said, I can't help but feel like there's something missing here that stops it from being a GREAT movie. It's frustrating because I can't put my finger on why, but then at a point I remember all the things this movie does have going for it, and it ultimately doesn't matter that my gut's telling me it's an 8/10 rather than a 9 or a 10.Right off the bat, well, right from the poster, it's pretty clear to see how fantastic this cast is, and I'm happy to say everyone gives a good performance here. It's hard to pick a standout, besides perhaps picking the characters who end up having more screen-time than others (and honestly, in a way that'd almost be a spoiler for a movie like this).I was similarly impressed by how this movie managed to be very funny without feeling silly or like an outright spoof of mystery/whodunnit movies. It presents a multi-layered mystery that's easy to take seriously, yet never really gets too bogged down or overly gloomy. The humour's there and it almost always lands, but for me never really distracted or seemed out of place, and I think it's the sign of a truly great screenplay if it's able to balance varied emotions and provoke different responses from its audience. It's going to get compared a lot to Clue (1985) and maybe also Murder By Death (1976), though I'd say Knives Out is better than those on account of being just as funny without being farcical to the point of not being able to be taken seriously.Honestly, ignore my fairly petty suggestion that this movie's missing something, because to be frank I'm trying to do the same. Sit back, let the movie do its thing, and enjoy yourself. Coming up to awards season, with lots of serious movies vying for the attention of critics and awards-givers, sometimes a movie like Knives Out is exactly what audiences may find themselves needing."
"As a fan of Agatha Christis novels as well as TV shows from the 90s such as Columbo, I can say I was pretty surprised by how good this movie was. I cannot remember seeing anything close to the Whodunnit stories I have read/seen back in the day. But Knives Out takes the cake, today. Along with a fun performance by a remarkable cast of A listers, Rian Johnson delivered a coherent and entertaining story for the genre, even taking it one step further - without getting into any spoilers.I judge a whodunnit movie on my capability to guess who the murderer is. The easiest it is to guess, the weakest the story. In that case, I was blown away by how the truth unfolded in such a surprising yet organic way. It just worked.I would recommend this movie for anyone really. It is fun, enjoyable and interesting. In a way it uses its characters to reflect various human flaws such as greed and pride, and uses the non linear narration to construct a consistent and convincing product.Big Up!"
"Though not similar in plot, this stupendous update of the classic ""someone's dead in the manor-whodunit"" put me in mind of ""Clue"" because of its fun, out there characters and the huge manor house where the murder has occurred.The cast is especially fun and surprising because they're such an assorted lot, with not one of them an actor I'd expect to be cast in a murder mystery.Standouts are Ana de Armas as the caregiver at the center of the mystery and Daniel Craig with an Foghorn Leghorn Southern accent that's a career 180 for him. Hilarious!You won't figure out the end till the end. It's just a fun ride the whole way through. The only reason I gave it only 9 out of 10 is that it lagged a bit in the second hour, but it never bores me!Don't miss seeing this in the theater. It's a blast seeing the crazy expressions and petty behaviors of the characters on the big screen."
Can not express how amazing the movie. A great plotline with truly funny humor. Been a while since I have been this impressed by a movie.
Best movie of the year. The acting is amazing the story is new 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
"Great combination of mystery, suspense and comedy. I can see myself watch it again. Awesome cast and acting."
"Daniel Craig leads an absolute rock-star cast in this classic who-done-it film. Nothing really makes Knives Out unique when compared to it's murder mystery peers, but it just performs so much better. This is attributed to it's solid pacing in the first 2 acts, it's phenomenal acting, and it's fairly cheery attitude. Knives Out is one that the whole family can follow and enjoy."
"I cannot imagine someone going to see Knives Out in theaters and leaving saying that they didn't have a good time. Knives Out manages to be at once a true whodunit and also a fresh and modern take on the genre, and manages to have a great mystery, great characters and themes, and great humor. Rian Johnson's screenplays and visual touches have always been treats when I watch his movies, and they were on full display here. The script is really tight and so good, working on many levels. It is really challenging to write a good whodunit because you want to give clues to the answer but don't want to make it obvious, and this is now the primary example I'll cite of giving plenty of information as makes sense in the plot, providing some relevant red herrings, and tying it up in a way that makes perfect sense in retrospect. The script is also great because it sets up the characters really well to then show some significant social messages: how Americans can look down on immigrants, how the prospect of money can lead people to drastic and aggressive departures from seemingly more reasonable characters, the relevance and entitlement of blood relation, and the contradiction between feeling successful and superior as a result of inherited wealth while also claiming to be self-made. Seeing the movie from Marta's perspective heightened these themes and also was a way of flipping the script from the traditional whodunit detective perspective. Finally, the script is great because the movie is absolutely hilarious. I love Daniel Craig's ""CSI KFC"" detective (the lines about there being a hole in the case, like a donut, and then that hole seeming to be filled but really being another donut with a smaller hole inside the bigger donut hole, was just amazing), I love the running bit about them having no idea where Marta was from and just naming South American countries, and I love the way all the characters are played to a T, especially Nana, Joni (Collette), and Ransom (Evans).Getting into spoilers, the ending is really great. I was convinced the entire time that he had set his death up and left one last mystery for them, but that was just a really good red herring. The motive and the way Ransom acted makes a lot of sense given the unfolding of information and also ties up all loose threads very cleanly. Rather than having a twist for twist's sake, Johnson sets up a plausible and complex mystery with a legitimate solution but lots of surprises. The ending was also great in how it showed everyone in the family's focus on material wealth and never truly connecting with or caring about Harlan, while Marta did. She didn't play Go purely to win, she played to make beautiful patterns, same as how she lived with kindness. It never feels overstuffed or too complicated, but has many new twists and pieces of information that keep you thinking. The runtime absolutely flies by, as it's so energetic and funny. A great movie for everyone to watch and enjoy. This and Parasite have easily the two best scripts I've seen this year and among the stronger ones in my memory, so I'll be very sad if neither is nominated for screenplay (fairly likely)."
I went into this with no expectations. I was pleasantly surprised. Very well-written and the acting was superb. I enjoyed seeing Jamie Lee Curtis and Don Johnson on the big screen.
"Now, I'm not a fan of the Last Jedi but that's no reason to dislike Rian Johnson as a director. I think he is best suited to doing things that aren't part of a franchise but let him unleash his creativity, as he has proven previously with Looper and now with Knives Out. This movie was beautifully shot, very well acted, the script was great and on top of that it is also genuinely funny. All the actors are great in their roles and everyone gets to have at least one moment in which they can shine as their respective character. I was very surprised that I could not see where the movie was going to go at all. It truly does a murder mystery movie completely differently and I am glad that the trailers did not reveal any major plot pointsl. Compared to a movie called the Good Liar that I saw recently, which was also a movie with plenty of twists Knives Out is at least a league above it. Whilst the Good Liar's surprises felt weak and preposterous, the twists in Knives Out are great and constantly keep you guessing. I was totally engrossed throughout and I was not bored even for a minute of its running time and fully recommend it. I really hope Rian Johnson makes more original movies instead of the rumored Star Wars trilogy as he is a very good director and needs to stick to projects that let him showcase his talents appropriately."
I see a lot of movies so I love a movie that I can't guess the ending and its even better when it's well acted. This has an amazing caat!
Rian Johnson finally subverted our expectations in a really really clever and rewarding way! GREAT MOVIE!
"Greetings again from the darkness. ""I suspect 'fow-uhl' play."" So states the renowned and poetically named private detective, Benoit Blanc. Of course when mega-wealthy, best-selling author Harlan Thrombey supposedly commits suicide after his 85th birthday party by slashing his own throat with a knife, something more sinister (you know, like ... murder) must be considered. The violin playing over the opening shots of the palatial Thrombey manor teases us with thoughts of most any year from the past 75. These nostalgic thoughts fade quickly as we begin to meet the players.Detective Elliott (LaKeith Stanfield) and Trooper Wagner (a quite funny Noah Segan) seem merely to be crossing their T's in the suicide investigation as they dutifully meet with each family member for a statement. It's this progression of questioning that introduces us to the year's most colorful ensemble cast. Patriarch Thrombey's (Christopher Plummer) scheming heirs-in-waiting include: his daughter Linda Drysdale (Jamie Lee Curtis), happy to remind you of her success as a self-made businessperson; Linda's smarmy husband Richard (Don Johnson); their renegade son Ransom (Chris Evans) who arrives a bit later; Harlan's son Walt Thrombey (Michael Shannon) who 'runs' the family publishing business; Harlan's ex-daughter-in-law Joni (Toni Collette), a self-help guru who has a secret side gig; grandkids Meg (Katherine Langford), preppy social media troll Jacob (Jaeden Martell), and Donna (Riki Lindhome of ""Garfunkel and Oates""); and Harlan's mother Greatnana (Dallas' own K Callan). Two key non-family members are the housekeeper Fran (Edi Patterson) who finds Harlan's body, and nurse Marta (Ana de Armas), Harlan's friend and only real confidante.Writer-director Rian Johnson has put together a diverse career with such films as indie breakout BRICK (2005), science fiction hit LOOPER (2012) and of course, STAR WARS: EPISODE VIII - THE LAST JEDI (2018). With this latest, he shows a real flair with a rare comedic whodunit, and manages to perfectly execute his twisted script of twisted personalities. Think of this as Agatha Christie meets CLUE via THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS. The overall mangled morality of this entitled family becomes crystal clear as we get to know each. Johnson presents many familiar elements for fans of the mystery genre (the dark mansion, the creepy line-up of hangers-on, the red-herring clues and missteps), and most impressively, he blends those with many creative and surprising moments ... some that will have you believing you have it figured out. But even if you do, the long and winding road is an utter blast.Even with that deep and talented cast, it's Daniel Craig as Benoit Blanc and Ana de Armas as Marta who stand out. They have the most screen time and neither waste a moment. Mr. Craig's purposefully comedic southern drawl completes the film's most memorable character, in fact, one of the year's most memorable characters. Ms. de Armas finally finds a role to take advantage of her skill. Nurse Marta has a lie-detecting reflux gag that is not just valuable to the case, but also vital to the loudest audience reaction during the film. Mr. Craig and Ms. de Armas will also appear together in the upcoming Bond film NO TIME TO DIE.During the reading of the will, director Johnson brings in STAR WARS stalwart Frank Oz (best known as Yoda) to play the family attorney, while another scene features one of the all-time great character actors (and Roger Ebert favorite) M. Emmet Walsh (BLOOD SIMPLE). Mr. Johnson also offers a unique spin on classism and the 1%, including a running gag about Marta's nation of origin.Johnson's regular team is in top form here: Cinematographer Steve Yedlin, Film Editor Bob Ducsay, and composer Nathan Johnson (Rian's cousin). Another deserving of mention is Costume Designer Jenny Eagan, who matches threads with personality about as effectively as we've seen, and Production Designer David Crank who creates the ideal mansion of secrets. This film is wickedly clever and barrels of fun. There may not have been a more purely entertaining movie this year ... and it's been a terrific year for movies. Just remember: 'My house. My rules. My coffee."""
"If you are a fan of old school detective mysteries, this movie will warm your heart. It borrows heavily from some of the best detective works of all time (Agatha Christie's ""Curtain"" and ""The Murder of Roger Aykroyd"" come to mind), and I do not mean that as an insult.The acting is top notch, as you would expect from this cast, but I enjoyed the cinematography as well. And the director plays fair with the audience - it's possible to guess the full final solution to the mystery, but that does not take away from the enjoyment of watching the characters get there.The real triumph of the movie, however, is Daniel Craig's portrayal of private investigator Benoit Blanc. Craig plays him like a Southern Hercule Poirot - bumbling on the surface, but observant with a keen intellect and a flair for the dramatic. I would rather see Craig play this character again than play James Bond - and that's no insult to his portrayal of Bond."
"Rian Johnson's love letter to the whodunit is a fun thriller that I can't wait to see again. Knives Out has a ton of twists and turns, but the heart of the film is Marta who steals the show with her honesty.I don't want to get into too many details that might spoil the film, but the final shot is awesome. This film cements Rian Johnson as one of the top tier directors. He's done a little bit of everything and he's done it all very well."
Knives Out is a whodunit and hosts a plethora of interesting characters who remain within the roles of the genre's archetypes but doesn't become cheap tropes. The various twists and turns do not feel forced and everything has its place. One might say it fits together like a puzzle. Thoroughly entertaining from start to finish
"I haven't been this entertained at a movie this year..brilliant writing,hilarious,amazing acting a brilliant whodunnit movie everyone needs to go see..I see rian Johnson winning an Oscar and golden globe for this movie..can't praise it enough"
"This is great fun, delivered with humor and a plot that keeps you guessing. Daniel Craig shows he can act as well as save the world."
"Rain Johnson is a mega talent. This film proves the immutability of a well written, tight script."
"Let's be honest this year has been full of stinkers. It Chapter 2 was a near three hour comedy. Terminator Dark Fate bombed because it told the same story. The Irishman was painfully boring and overrated. Even Joker was overhyped, I liked it a lot but I don't think it's really a classic. But here comes Knives Out one of the best murder mystery comedies in recent memory.Pros: for one, it's very well shot. On a technical aspect the camera work and the way it's shot is great. The acting is superb nobody was bad in this movie not even Daniel Craig, his character was supposed to be over the top so I get the complaints about his southern accent but I thought he was great. The story was very clever, full of twists and turns that just left me guessing until the end. The small things such as the immigration theme and the vomiting all come into play and are very necessary to the plot. It's a typical murder mystery where you're trying to find the real killer along with the detectives. The dialogue was sharp and witty, very witty. I get it Rian Johnson ruined Star Wars for some, get over it he made one bad movie, he's really an awesome filmmaker. Don't hate this movie because it was made by a guy that ruined your franchise.Cons: I guess the social commentary wasn't necessary, I mean Hollywood just loves social commentary in almost everything. It gets annoying but it wasn't that bad, it didn't ruin the movie at all. In fact it was crucial to the plot. The southern accent by Daniel Craig was also hard to get used to at first, but when you learn his character is supposed to be over the top you get over it and you can't help but love his character.Best movie of 2019 and probably one of the best movies I've seen in theaters in a long time. It was fun, suspenseful, hilarious and clever. Please see this!"
Great movie all around. Perfect cast to lead a mystery. Had me on the edge of my seat the whole time.
It's distribution that first inspired me to see this movie there is only good actor. Then very quickly we are immersed in the plot and it keeps us in breath from beginning to end. beautiful film that touched my sensitivity
"Loved the movie as it transported me to the good old detective world of Sherlock Holmes meets Hercule Poirot - an old fashioned whodunnit plot (complete with an eccentric family, family fortune and of course the murder) in a modern setting."
"This film was incredible! I did not know what to expect considering Chris Evans as one of the stars and his main works in the past were superhero films. He absolutely nailed his role as did the rest of the cast. This film had my attention the entire time and I will most definitely be buying it on DVD once released! I for sure recommend this film for anyone who loves a good murder mystery!!When Blanc was revealing Ransom as the ""killer"" , my head was SPINNING. I had a tough time keeping up with the entire explanation. (It all made sense; it was just a TON to take in.) I knew there would be clues throughout the movie as to who did it, and I am disappointed in myself for not catching some of them. I was also conflicted the whole time about whether or not I wanted Marta to get caught or not.."
I absolutely loved this movie it's a real whodunnit if you love Agatha Christie or Clue this movie is for you keeps you guessing until the very end
"Great film. Really enjoyed this movie, it even kept my wife's interest through the whole movie."
Well this is a bonkers movie. An Agatha Christie country house murder mystery with a great cast of suspects. Daniel Craig is the private Eye helping police find out who killed the rich dad Christopher Plummer. Don Johnson Jamie Lee Curtis Chris Evans Michael Shannon Toni Colette and Chris Evans are the family members in the frame. Ana de Armas is the nurse another suspect who's a ringer for a young Rose Byrne. I enjoyed the twists and turns and ending but some of the cast play it straight while more ham it up which is disconcerting. It certainly doesn't take itself seriously and overall its good fun but Daniel Craig sounding like Kevin Spacey is very creepy!!!
"Benoit Blanc, 'the last of the gentlemen detectives,' is engaged to solve the murder of a famous mystery novelist.A ""who done it"" with a classic feel and a great cast playing a good collection of characters. All the elements of a traditional murder mystery are blended with some nice humour that ranges from clever to bizarre.The blame could have been aimed at a wider range of the characters more squarely. I enjoyed the movie much more up until the reveal; there are some surprises after that but not the anticipated big twist.I liked, 'That was the dumbest car chase.'"
"A loving nod to ""Clue"" here, a memory of ""Murder by Death"" there and stir together with some ""Death on the Nile"" and ""And then there were None"" and you have the epitome of the murder mystery genre - and that's what ""Knives Out"" is. From the constantly autumnal surroundings, casting dark shadows through every twisted hallway of the house to the lineup of classic suspects this is literally a perfect murder mystery. And what does the genre almost always call for? A twist. And with this film you have a twist within a twist within a twist. Or a donut within a donut hole within a donut... that'll make sense when you see the film."
"Ignore any noise being spouted from jaded 'Star Wars' fanboys. Rian Johnson is among the finest filmmakers currently working in Hollywood.Consider his resume: he wrote and directed 'Brick;' he wrote and directed 'The Brothers Bloom;' he wrote and directed 'Looper;' he directed the Breaking Bad episodes 'Fly,' 'Fifty-One,' and 'Ozymandias;' and most recently he wrote and directed easily the best murder-mystery of the year, 'Knives Out.'The plot is dense and brilliantly serpentine--just as one should expect from a quintessential film of the genre--taking on the characteristics of an ouroboros.Each of the characters in the film are familiar, flawed, and driven by their own delightfully selfish motivations.But it's the writing-oh the wonderful writing!-that makes this picture as powerful and poetic as it is. From the plot to the dialogue to the very last gasps of the denouement, Johnson keeps the audience completely rapt and on the edge of their seats wishing the saga could somehow continue ad infinitum."
"GRADE: BTHIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: An highly entertaining murder mystery that harks back to an early time and succeeds as a delightful tribute to the classic whodunnit genre.JIM'S REVIEW: Knives Out is a nifty little murder mystery that pays homage to the once popular whodunnit genre. Rian Johnson assembles a fine cast of actors and writes his carefully plotted screenplay to masterful effect. Any armchair detective or moviegoer should enjoy this intriguing diversion.Mr. Johnson sets up his mystery in an elegant old mansion, the home of Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer), a successful mystery writer who sets the plot in motion on his 85th birthday celebration by agitating family members with secrets and scandals afoot. His demise seems like a foregone conclusion with many of his children and their offsprings all having enough anger and motives to do the old fellow in.The main suspects and possible heirs to the family fortune include: Linda Drysdale (Jamie Lee Curtis), Harlan's eldest daughter, and her husband, Richard (Don Johnson), Harlan's youngest son, Walt (Michael Shannon), who is in charge of his father's publishing house, and Joni (Toni Collette), Harlan's free-spirited daughter-in-law. Also brought into the fray are Harlan's spoiled grandson with the unfortunate nickname, Ransom (Chris Evans), Meg (Katherine Langford) and Jacob (Jaeden Martell), two more of Harlan's grandchildren, and Marta (Ana de Armas), his loyal and loving nurse who cannot tell a lie. Along with the local police team investigating the case, Detective Lieutenant Elliot (Lakeith Stanfield) and Trooper Wagner (Noah Segan), is super sleuth and private detective, Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig). The cast is uniformly strong, and watching them inhabit their roles is a particular pleasure, with Mr.Plummer, Ms. de Armas, and a wonderful Mr. Craig as stand-outs.Knives Out keeps one guessing as all good mystery should do and while it stays within the Thrombey home, the story remains true to its roots. But, in the third act, the film unwisely opens up its atmospheric setting and loses some of its cherished momentum with an unexciting car chase sequence, some unnecessary plot twists, and a slightly disappointing ending.Still, Mr. Johnson's solidly uses style and ingenuity in his overall construction of his whodunnit and directs with flair. This is especially true when he incorporates his visual images to reveal the true goings-on of the events in question which directly contradicts the suspect's alibis. The audience seems to get the upper hand before the team of detectives start their deductions, making the story more complex and entertaining.Knives Out is a clever nostalgic send-up of the old murder mystery whodunnit done well. This Clue-like stage has been set for an old-fashioned murder and the mystery formula remains intact. Yes, this modern update is a welcome reimagining of the classic whodunnit and has enough charm and intelligence that would make Dame Agatha proud. Sleuth on!"
"As a fan of police romances and investigation I loved the movie. Of course it isn't perfect as there are some open strings in the investigation. But the clues and how the story is played out makes it an almost perfect ""who dunnit"" story which is a must see for people who like this genre. It is enjoyable and funny to watch. The cast is competent and the acting is great.One thing that I would like to highlight is the bad habit that the current blockbuster american movies have to include political discussion into the movie. It is completely irrelevant to the movie, it doesn't add to it at all. We already have such political discussions everyday during the week, we don't spend money to to see this kind of stuff in the big screen as well. Of course it doesn't not ruiin the experience of this movie, but they need to learn that this need to stop."
"When news broke that Renée Zellweger was cast as Bridget Jones, I remember mutterings and complaints from British critics and audiences; couldn't an up and coming British actor have been given such the opportunity? What sort of mess would the American make of the accent? Hugh Grant and Colin Firth were cast opposite her and despite the complaints and suspicions, the film was a huge hit, spawned sequels and it now seems rather quaint to think about these complaints at all.This was in the back of mind approaching Knives Out. Director Rian Johnson directs a starry American cast (and Daniel Craig, sporting an occasionally inconsistent Southern accent) in a film he also wrote that was to be a homage to the British murder mystery in general and Agatha Christie in particular. I could imagine some of the genre most loyal fans getting uptight about an American take on British traditions, but I hadn' t heard many of these complaints - may be, Brexit and Trump notwithstanding - we're all a bit more internationally-minded now.In any case, it really doesn't matter. Knives Out is a blast. The plot is a finely constructed work of crystalline beauty; each performance from the stellar cast is given at least a few moments in the sun; the denouement has more than one 'aha!' moment as revelations fall into place; and there are more laugh out loud moments than in many comedies, all of which occur without taking the viewer out of the moment, undercutting the drama. To cap it all, the film also works - and is clearly intended to, especially in light of the ending - as a metaphor for how immigration and precisely the sort of nationalism which turned its nose up at the thought of an American Bridget Jones; but it's not a metaphor that dominates the film, nor is it an overtly political one.What it is, is a very, very entertaining film which has - if those who need to say yes to such things do so - the clear capacity to produce a sequel or three. It's one of those films likely to be enjoyed by people who don't go to the cinema, to be discussed over Christmas dinner (rather than the politics), to be curled up with in a couple of years in the week between Christmas and New Year."
If you can forgive daniel craigs appauling southern accent this is a funny watch which leaves you guessing which way it will turn next at each junction.
"This movie is good but it isn't that great. The Agatha Christie style who dunnit with an all star cast is involving and fun to watch. The tension you feel for the character Marta played well by Armas is unique. So there is an inventiveness that keeps the viewer concentrating for clues and wrapped up in the dynamic of the characters. The in fighting in the family is funny. And the way they turn on her is painfully real. The way nasty relatives are shown may be too close to home for some viewers.Christopher Plummer is amazing actor - he in his late eighties and the rest of the cast hams it up including Toni Collette, Jamie Lee Curtis and Daniel Craig with an exaggerated but intelligible accent. In ""Fierce People"" Chris Evans acted a similar role so it was a bit of a déjà vu how his character turned out.But there are some flaws. The grand explanation with the switching of the medicine is confusing and unconvincing. Also the family wasn't that bad to justify a total disinheriting. If the patriarch wanted to help Marta he didn't have to leave her everything. She was doing a job well and a sizeable legacy would have sufficed. There is a political slant to the story that Agatha Christie wouldn't have had. Here the writer pits the sweet good hearted daughter of an illegal immigrant against the evil white entitled wealthy mercenary people. Too cliched.Despite the flaws it's worth a watch because movies like this aren't that common anymore."
"Granted this movie is finally 8.1/10 but it's too good of a movie that I couldn't not review it. Rian Johnson screwed the pooch on TLJ. True. But this is not that. This is brilliant. This is original. This is classic. Just when you think you have it solved, there's more. But not in a convoluted and stupid way. It's masterful. The ""whodunit"" is his forte. I only hope he has more of these up his sleeve."
"Except for some unnecessary language, this was a masterpiece. Funny, thinker, well acted and well shot. We all enjoyed it."
"Entertaining. Love the atmosphere, set, and characters.
Scathing takedown of the hypocrisy found amongst many wealthy, white liberals. I say that as someone whose swinging from fairly far to the left. Just a solid movie all around.
Full disclosure: Sometimes I enjoy a little cheese with my movies."
"I think the setting was great bringing in a little Agatha Christie as another reviewer wrote. I just like Jamie Lee Curtis but hearing Daniel Craig with a ""southern drawl"" was a show stopper and a tongue in cheek comedy element. After a first few minutes I thought of the old Columbo show but I want say why as it might give a slight plot revel. I had thought I had figured out the mystery only to run into a twist but I was a little right. Good fun to watch movie. Go see."
"So many twists and turns, awesome for people who like the murder mystery genre"
"This is one of the smartest film i have ever watched. It kept me on the edge of my seat and had me guessing at every clue. This is probably the most fun i had while watching a movie. The stellar cast is just the surface of this mysterious, fun, and mind-twisting masterpiece."
It's boring . Maybe a home watch but surely not a theatre watch.
"Knives Out is a murder mystery movie through and through, echoing Sherlock, Poirot, and Murder She Wrote. But being a Rian Johnson movie, there's more beneath the surface than the obvious callbacks and parodies. If you go into this movie feeling like you know the outcome, you're wrong. This is a mystery cliché-free zone. The movie opens with the apparent suicide of a successful murder mystery author and the subsequent gathering of his family for the funeral, memorial, and will reading. Meanwhile a private detective has been hired by an anonymous client to look further into the suicide, with the full resources of the local police department behind him.The biggest and earliest cliché dodge of the movie is in revealing the details of Harlan Thrombey's death in the first half an hour. Yes, this is a murder mystery where the murder is solved (at least for the audience) really early. It's an inspiring choice that goes a long way to setting up the rest of the movie. We then follow the cover-up underneath Benoit Blanc's nose the entire time, giving us a fresh and new perspective in an otherwise overdone and tired genre. But don't let this lull you into thinking there's no mystery to be had. The explanation we get is still riddled with holes (doughnut holes, to be more precise), and there's the ever-pervading mystery of who hired Benoit Blanc in the first place, and why. I know what you're thinking, because I was thinking it too, but no, that's not the big twist at the end either.But Knives Out's success lies in not only the unpredictable twist, but the ingenious journey there. The climax of the movie is neither plainly obvious, but nor is it a complete left hook, coming out of nowhere based on no evidence, or on evidence only Benoit Blanc has seen, or on an overabundance of evidence and red herrings, nor is it so outlandish it borders on the unbelievable. The hints and clues are there throughout the movie if you're keen enough to catch them. I caught a couple myself, but had no way of applying them or even knowing they were clues until the final reveal at the end. By the time the credits have rolled, every loose end has been neatly tied up, and every set-up paid off in one way or another. There's an obvious set-up in the prop knife, but also keep a look out for the baseball and make sure you track its movements as the movie goes on, as well as the odd line and snippet of information offered by the characters, particularly around games.There's more to Knives Out than just the murder mystery though. For starters the cinematography is electric. It may not be so obvious as some of Johnson's previous work, but there's still some great cinematic shots to enjoy. Examples include Benoit's face bathed in shadow as he lights his cigar, or Meg's illuminated eyes while on the phone to Marta. Likewise the soundtrack perfectly embodies the murder mystery genre and makes you feel right at home as soon as the movie begins. It won't win any awards, but it suits the movie and does its job.Somewhat surprisingly there's also a level of comey throughout. Never quite laugh-out-loud hilarious, but there's plenty of jokes and running gags. Daniel Craig in particular seems to be having a lot of fun with this movie, putting on an over-the-top southern drawl, and coming out with lines such as ""The Nazi child masturbating in the bathroom"" and ""The doughnut had a hole in the middle that was filled by another doughnut, your doughnut, but your doughnut also has a hole in the middle"". Surprisingly Michael Shannon has a selection of fantastic lines as well, such as ""I will not eat one iota of sh*t"" and ""You want a cookie now?!"" Chris Evans is another one quite obviously having a great time as a smarmy git, in stark contrast to his Captain America persona (sorry dude, you will always be compared to your most iconic role).On the note of acting, it was great to see Ana de Armas in the leading role (no, this is not Daniel Craig's movie), and not once did her insane attractiveness come up or be exemplified over her role in the story. She was her character and played her role like any other actor, proving that she absolutely has the acting chops capable of carrying an entire movie on her shoulders. Toni Collette is another stand-out as a privileged fashion/health guru, as is Christopher Plummer as the unfortunate Harlan Thrombey. And it was nice to actually see Frank Oz again, in his first live-action role in nearly twenty years.Knives Out was an all-round good fun movie. It'll keep you guessing up to the last, it'll keep you laughing and amused as it all unravels, and there's plenty more to mine in multiple viewings. I can't say it's the best of Rian Johnson's work, but it carries on his neverending streak of really good movies. I give Knives Out a solid 8/10."
"Knives Out is a new murder mystery where someone amongst the group of family and friends is a killer and join the journey to piece the puzzle.When the father of the lush and rich family is found dead, a detective is hired to help solve the mystery and question the family to try discover if this was a murder or suicide.This movie is probably one of my faves of the year. There's so much humour, twists and guessing.
The only reason I'm rating it 8 instead of a 10 is because I felt it was a little too long and could've been a bit shorter, and I wasn't a huge fan of Daniel Craig's accent."
"I was convinced (until the housekeeper was murdered) that the victim was still alive and had somehow faked his death in order to get material for his next murder mystery novel because he suffered from writer's block. LOL. That said, I was disappointed that there wasn't a little more humor. Jamie Lee Curtis and Don Johnson have decent comedic timing that largely went untapped. The storyline would have been more interesting had one of the ladies been the guilty party. This also would have made for more interesting dialogue."
Viewers who don't think this is a great movie do not understand what whodunit films should be. This ticks all the boxes and keeps you hooked until the very end. It's hilarious and deserves so much credit!!
"A complex and well-written film that is entertaining from start to end. A true ensemble, as no one steals the show and they compliment each other perfectly. That is though where we find the weakest link of the film. The characters are not very dynamic and do feel as plot pushers more than individuals in this world. This aside, the pacing is spot on and the level of thrills Johnson is able to create when we believe the mystery is over is amazing. The humor is wonderful and very natural to the characters and the world we find ourselves in. Easily one of the best films of the year!"
"""Knives Out"" is a whodunnit murder mystery movie that had both an entertaining and compelling plot. I was at the edge of my seat from start to finish. Although, I enjoyed the movie, I was not particularly fond of the ending where Ransom gets arrested and Marta keeps Harlan's inheritance. To put it plainly, I completely despised Marta. She was an evil, manipulative,annoying and just a horrible person in general. The ending showcased Marta standing on the terrace and sipping coffee and glancing at the Thrombey family. The family always treated Marta with respect and kindness and this is how she repays them. She does not have the decency to support the family like they supported her all those years. This is disgraceful. It abandons the whole notion of how family is the most important thing. I understand that Harlan wanted to give his inheritance to Marta, but he should have given something to his family. He knows them longer than Marta. Marta should have been arrested, even though she technically did not do anything. The humor inside the movie was at times contrived and not funny at all. For instance, the scene where Ransom tries to kill Marta with a knife wasn't funny at all. It made me hate the Marta character even more.The movie had numerous twists and turns that were unexpected and shocking. From the beginning to the end of the movie, my mind was blown. I did not expect the reveal that Ransom was the one who hired the private investigator. At times, the movie was quite convoluted and confusing for me. It took quite a few minutes till I figured out what was going on.""Knives Out"" could be an Oscar contender for Best Picture and Best Original Score. All the actors were amazing in their roles, especially Daniel Craig and Chris Evans who portrayed the private investigator and spoiled son-in-law respectively. It was a joy to see Daniel Craig and Chris Evans fully embracing their characters."
Go see this film. You won't be disappointed!Just the right amount of comedy sprinkled into the mystery.
"If you loved Murder on the orient express, then you'll love this even more. Great cast, brilliant cinematography and just when you think the case is closed and the movie is over, BANG! You're hit with a huge twist. An excellent crime investigation film that absolutely leaves you guessing all the way to the end. My reason for 9 stars? Daniel Craig's horrible attempt at what I think was a Southern American accent. But then again, I could be wrong; it was that bad."
Nothing special to see here. Just a tired old cast rehashing cluedo. Poor writing and direction. Don't waste your money.
"I'm going to be transparent and tell you outright that I had gone to watch this film with tinted glasses. Tinted with the shade from last Jedi. I hated that movie so much that I was prepared to hate this one as well (imagine having that chip on your shoulder).Even after the movie, I kept looking for flaws to justify my shoulder chip. However, fair is fair, and at the end of the day, this is a good film. I didn't see much which can be perceived to be of political nature in this one at all. Its a who dun it with a lot of funny one liners set in a fancy estate. The cast was excellent, the writing was classy and funny and listen, you'll have fun while watching it.A movie that doesn't piss you off, with some suspense, good one liners, good cast, A fun time to spend at the cinema. What more do you expect from a movie?I put 9 and 10 star reviews for movies with exemplary technical achievements, pulling off a very difficult sequel or unique artistic value. While I cant claim those things for this movie, your fun is guaranteed. Go see it and forget about star wars for once."
"Rian Johnson has crafted an enjoyable new spin on the murder mystery genre. With a stacked cast led by Daniel Craig and Chris Evans having loads of fun in their roles, Knives Out is very much set in today's world and updated accordingly. I liked that the story was a complex web, but not one impossible to follow if you pay attention to the various little clues throughout the movie. Even if you can guess what will happen, there are still some extra twists that can throw you for a loop. This film is terrifically entertaining and will leave you in awe of its pay off."
"Knives Out has to be one of the best movies I've watched. From the writing right down to the cast I mean WOW!! Kept you guessing every step of the way. I don't understand why anybody would give it a 3 or a 4 or a 5 out of 10. All I got to say if you really want a good laugh, with twist and turns and a real mystery movie trust me KNIVE OUT IS THE ONE TO WATCH!!!!"
"This is one to see. With a great cast, and excellent script and screenplay, you will be thoroughly entertained.
Daniel Craig does the southern detective to a T. Toni Collette is unmatched in her portrayal as the gold digger. But wait! Don Johnson and Jamie Lee Curtis are so much fun on the screen again. Then the somewhat new comer, Ana de Armas hits one out of the park. Enjoy the walk down the path of mystery!"
"I went into this movie with high expectations given the cast and boy did it live up!! Acting was great and the story was very entertaining, I was guessing throughout! It was also a lot funnier than I was expecting! People may say Daniel Craig's accent was hard to hear but I personally loved it haha! Definitely recommend this to all mystery lovers."
"This was such fun. It was great watching Daniel Craig be his cleverist (is that a word -- then I make it up) best as Benoit Blanc. From the beginning when he clicked when someone told a lie to the end when he figured out the lay of things. I also got a kick out of Don Johnson in this movie. I've never seen him in a role were he appeared to be so vulnerable and he did it well. Jamie Lee plays the same character in so many movies, so it's hard to tell whether that's the real Jamie Lee or not. Toni Collette was terrific and I loved all the angles they shot her -- she would look either evil or coquettish in the same scene from different angels. K Callan was a kick. She could stare with the best of them. That might have been the easiest and most memorable part she's played in a while -- a true scene stealer. And needless to say, Everybody loves Christopher Plummer. Finally, one cannot leave out Ana de Armas as Marta. She did quite well, indeed, as a frightened maid who has great reason to be. And she looks a lot better as a brunette.One thing I thoroughly appreciated about this film is that you entered into politics, BUT you had both sides of the argument, not just the libs side of things. And I loved that Don has the last word on that. :) Made me happy I didn't have to leave the movie because I will if a movie is so biased.Thanks for good fun. I love a good mystery."
"Starting things off with the cast, there performances are astonishing, there characters are so mentally rich as you know that the old guy commited suicide. However, you had a feeling that each one of them kill him, and that was an awesome feeling. The best performances was from Daniel Criag who has a character that is new to me, a detective comedian, sort of, plus Chris Evans who passes his shield to Anthony Mackie to become a bad guy which was so refreshing and good for him moving forward in his career. The ending is what makes this one a 10/10 picture because it is twisty and very interesting to wait for. Last but not least I enjoy the high class feeling of this movie, and I want to watch more movies like that in the future. The question is: Is it OSCAR Worthy? I would say yes. Which category? I don't know maybe (only) Best Picture"
"What a terrific written and directed movie! MUCH better that I though it was going to be. Seriously, I went to see it just because Daniel Craig was in it! What a pleasant surprise."
"Apparently all the low ratings are due to thinking one is supposed to take this movie seriously. Yes, it makes fun of the genre - that is intentional. And as for politics - every person in the cast of suspects is corrupt in some way.I had a tremendous time at this film and want to go see it again to catch the bits I missed.Still can't place Craig's accent. It was weird. But that might have been intentional too. One if the little jokes was his name - Benoit Blanc - white pope allusion, pontificating.I thought Chris Evans was excellent - played to perfection.Toni Collette, a favorite of mine, had the most fun.And it was great to see Don Johnson - perfectly cast as his naughty, charming self.Lots of gems in this one, if one has the eyes and ears to see em.And the house!!!!"
"I didn't saw many of criminal movies, bit... This is just amazing! The best criminal movie I have ever seen!"
"I have watched the actual detective in style by Agatha Christie. There is a very good work of the scriptwriter and of the magnificent cast. This movie doesn't relax a grip till the last frame. Special I want to notice Ana de Armas' acting, she is nice surprised me."
It was a fun movie and worth watching but i Think with all The other movies i could have watched this was maybe worth it but go and have a time at The movies but you have to love a murder mysteri
"This flick is the epitome of ""a good time at the movies."" It's slick, surprising, gorgeously shot and features the best Daniel Craig performance in years. Script is tight and the cast is obviously having a ball.Just go see it. You will NOT regret it!"
Not your typical murder mystery where everything is revealed at the end but it's revealed in the beginning of the movie.
"Harlan Thrombury (Christopher Plummer ) has built an empire writing mystery novels. He is found dead in the morning of an apparent suicide by his nurse Marta (Ana de Armas) seemingly innocent and naive. Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig) a private investigator of mystery writer quality has been hired anonymously to investigate the incident as someone suspects foul play. During the interview process, we discover the events of the night in flashbacks. Everyone lied and had a motive. About 30 minutes into the film we discover who killed Harlan.The film has twists and clues as does any good mystery. Everyone was a quirky character. Harlan lived ""on a Clue Board"" and has written his family out of his will as they will not get a ""single red dime."" They need to grow on their own. If you love an entertaining old-style mystery you can't go wrong here.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity."
Overall it's a good movie and a cool murder mystery but the twist wasn't very impressive. I expected more from it. Daniel Craig and Ana De Armas delivered the best performances.
"I love Daniel Craig. I did not love him in this movie. As a Southerner with a thick accent, I really resent a Brit trying to use a southern accent. Another issue is a mystery without surprises. The plot was a little predictable and irritating."
"First of all, I enjoyed the film. Loved the music and the shots. The beginning part was great, with all the shots of the house (love the house) and slowly moving up to the important scene. If you are looking for a light, entertaining film, this is a good choice. Just don't take it as a sophisticated mystery that requires your logical reasoning.
So the three stars off is because I'm a big fan of Agatha Christine, and this story is not strong enough to be called a murder mystery for me. When I see the beginning: murder inside a house with fixed suspects, questioning with each person and finding holes in their words, they just shouts Agatha to me. But then what? All threads lead to our main character Marta. Other characters seems to just stand there, fighting each other, fighting against the will. What's their role in this murder mystery? Their verdicts, or just overall story, contributed almost nothing to the mystery, except for family drama. The whole movie just feels like Marta, Ransom, and other family members, what's the fun in guessing the murderer then?
Then there's our victim. I have no idea why someone would want to leave his fortune to his nurse, or slice his own throat for her. I mean yes, they have good relationships, and he wanted his family to do their own things instead of relying on his fortune. But he can always donate, right? How close he has to feel towards Marta to leave all his fortune to her and believe she could do the right thing? Furthermore, how close their relationship has to be to let him decide to slice his throat just to cover up for his nurse? I mean that's some painful way of death. And do people commit suicide by slicing their throat? If Harlan wants to cover for Marta, surly he would choose a method looking more like a suicide, like cutting the wrist? stab into his chest? I don't know. Anyway Harlan is waaay too good to Marta, in a way beyond my normal senses.
Lastly, the twist in the end was good, but... the whole story could have ended if they saw the surveillance camera or footprints on the muddy path. I mean Ransom didn't even try to cover it up. It's just coincidence both of them went through the same path. There are way too many coincidences in this story, including this, and the double mixing up bottles, the old lady who just happened to sit by the window that faces the secret path. If Marta chose a different way of creating alibi, Ransom would have been spotted the first day of our detective's investigation. So in short, a mystery that could have been solved early on if not for an coincidence.
This film could have been my favorite of the year. I mean the genre, the beautiful house, my favorite detective style, and all the good actors, but in the end I went out of the theater feeling mixed. I guess great anticipation usually comes with great disappointment..."
"So sad that this film only has 8.1 on IMDB. I don't know should I call these who made 1 and 2 stars stupid, but it is an awesome movie. While investigating the case, there are still so many funny parts, those who said the jokes are bad and not understand them are just truly boring people, maybe they just forget what is laugh and funny. The movieis fantastic and it deserves higher score."
"I missed the early access review, the seats left were completely in the front and I can't sit that close to the screen, it bothers my eyes. However I will come back tires Friday to give my real review but I'm sure my rating won't change. I've been waiting to see this movie."
"Just got back from the cinema seeing this.
I very much enjoyed it, when you thought you had it figured out they then change direction and cover it well! Acting was awesome, was hesitant with Craig's accent but he did a good job.
Not sure on the haters, the movie keeps you paying attention the entire time and would happily suggest go and see it."
"With an amazing ensemble cast, a unique and entertaining script, and some brilliant direction, Knives Out proves to not only be this years greatest Mystery/Thriller combo, but also one of the best films of the year period. To begin with the large cast of actors in the film, the biggest standouts include the obviously fantastic performance from Daniel Craig as Detective Blank, Chris Evans as Ransom, Christopher Plummer as Harlan, and the surprisingly show stealing Ana de Arma as Marta- Harlan's nurse. The film decides to stay away from the traditional sense and plot lines of murder mystery stories, and goes for an unexpected route that proves to as equally interesting as it is incredibly entertaining. Rian Johnson shines yet again, returning to his original filmwork brighter and better than before, and not letting the hate of Last Jedi (even though personally I didn't mind it too much), affect him and his work in any sort of way. The film is masterly crafted and is filled so many twists and turns that you truly won't know what's coming next. Making for one of the most original and smart films of the year, Knives Out is not only a bloody good time, but a clever, compelling, and well made one as well; proving yet again there is plenty of new stories still worth telling.
My Rating: 9.75/10"
"This movie is pretty good. A solid 8/10 and probably one of the best in 2019.Knives Out (as minimal as possible) is about the death of a family patriarch and the investigation of his death. It's written and directed by Rian Johnson; he did Looper which was great and The Last Jedi which was not so great but anyways..This movie is pretty damn good. It's a classic who-done-it crime/detective story set in modern day 2019. It's directed beautifully and the cinematography is on point. And it's actually very funny, which I don't think the marketing really shows.The performances in this movie are fantastic, especially by Bond himself, Daniel Craig. He carries this movie and honestly his character is an absolute joy to watch. The rest of the cast is great as well, notable performances from Ana De Armas and Chris Evans.The narrative and writing is also very well done by Rian Johnson. It's nice to see him doing films of his own instead of big franchise movies.Some of the characters are kinda there just for comedic effect, but
I didn't mind it. It wasn't really a bad thing, didn't bother the narrative. My main 'issue' with the movie was that I was hoping the actual plot itself involved more of the characters directly, if you watch the movie you'll probably notice that. It's not really an issue just something I thought would've made the movie better.Other than that I don't really see an actual flaw in the movie. The opening sequence is just perfect, the sound design fits perfectly. It's funny when it needs to be and suspenseful when it neds to be. Knives Out hits all the checkpoints of a good solid movie.Definitely check this one out it's really good, really enjoyable and an absolute killer (no pun intended)."
This movie is not worth see cause the review doesn't make no sense a the bill boards ads scares me.
"What can I say? It's just plain wacky! Daniel Craig as you've (probably) never seen him before. The trailer only hints at what is to come, and anyone who spoils the ending in these reviews is a knob. I've just come from a Cineworld unlimited screening and everybody was laughing out loud. Go see it, you won't regret it: a whodunit like no one's ever done it before, to quote the tagline!"
"Back in the days of black-and-white, mystery films were quite common but as the years went by, they became less and less common with the mystery genre becoming the domain of television. This is a pity, because I like an old-fashioned mystery. Between this movie and Murder on the Orient Express, it's nice to see the genre make a comeback. Director/writer Rian Johnson was definitely trying to evoke an old school mystery film with this homage, and after seeing the trailers, I definitely wanted to see this. I even went to a farther away early access screening because I couldn't wait. I'm pleased to say this definitely met my expectations.Knives Out is just a really well told movie. For 2 hr., 10 min., this is finely paced and edited. Johnson really knows how to steer the story, especially the beginning and introduction to the facts of the case.Besides being a mystery, this movie is also a critique of privilege, which I felt Johnson managed to not beat the audience over the head with. The movie also has a good sense of humor.The suspects consist of the Thrombey family, who from one extent to another all have leeched off of the money and success of patriarch and mystery writer Harlan Thrombey. They are such a delightfully self-entitled but diverse group of larger-than-life dysfunctional people. I'm a little disappointed that we didn't get more of them. (Ana de Armas' Marta Cabrera, Harlan's personal nurse, is the actual star of the film.) I especially thought that Linda Drysdale (Jamie Lee Curtis) is given short shrift.The cast is excellent all the way through, and I just don't have time to mention everyone. The best performance is by Daniel Craig as Southern gentlemen detective Benoit Blanc. He just kills it as the eccentric and well-spoken detective. I also appreciate that Benoit isn't portrayed as a socially awkward, mircaulous wunderkind as is often the case with detectives these days. Benoit is definitely the smartest guy in the room, but solving the case is real work for him. Again, this is Ana's story. The trailers make Benoit look like the lead. Just don't want you to have false expectations. He is one of the biggest players, make no mistakes.The movie looks great. The Thrombey estate is delightfully grand and old-fashioned looking and is decorated with a wide assortment of mystery-themed or antiquated bric-a-brac. The outfits all look great as well.There is only one thing about this movie that bothered me. The score tries for a classic mystery feel to it but tries too hard. A couple times it felt like they were just blasting the music in my face.Overall, this is just a very entertaining movie and definitely something for mystery fans."
"When I first saw the trailer i was thinking - this sounds very much like a la Columbo movie I've already seen and i didn't expect much, despite the cool cast. To my surprise the film was very entertaining, with funny moments and i found myself enjoying it quite a lot. Nicely done, I'd recommend it. 😊"
"Easily in my top 10 of 2019. Smart, funny and delightful."
"Knives Out stars many people and is a Rian Johnson whodunnit about a renowned crime novelist who is found dead at his estate just after his 85th birthday. A detective is then mysteriously enlisted to investigate. He questions and investigates everything and everyone in the house to find out what actually happened. I like Rian Johnson and his films from Looper to The Last Jedi. Naturally I was excited. However I found myself to be nervous for what was to come. Murder on the Orient Express came out two years ago and had an all star cast, similar to this, and I was really pumped for it. After watching it I was let down and kind of bored. I didn't want a repeat of that. Thankfully it's not! Johnson proves himself, yet again, as one of the best film directors in the business today. The story had so many laughs and shocking scenes. It took a different approach than a typical mystery film since we're given some information towards the beginning which confused me at first. I didn't know where it would go after that but it still managed to continue a mysterious tone and question what would happen next. The cast is just absolutely fantastic, not a single bad performance. The most notable performances for me were Daniel Craig, Chris Evans, and Ana de Armas. First off, Daniel Craig's voice took me for a loop. I'm so used to his british accent that when it was a southern accent I wasn't sure if it would annoy me, but I loved it. Honestly one of the best performances of the year. Chris Evan totally changes his nice Captain America personality to a total asshole and he does it so well. Every scene was fun with him. By far the best part of the film was Ana de Armas. She was in 2049 and I really liked her in that. I didn't think she'd be in this film for most of the runtime, but thankfully she was the star of it. The score from Nathan Johnson felt like a 70s mystery show. Great choice with that. The cinematography by Steve Yedlin capture the gorgeous setting. Some of the best production design of the year. As for flaws there's a couple characters that didn't feel necessary to the plot entirely. Jaeden Martell has maybe four lines because he does nothing and the cops that come and investigate didn't do much either. LaKeith Stanfield does some interviews, but the rest felt a little insignificant. Other than a couple week characters I had a blast watching Knives Out. I don't know if it has a strong enough potential for the oscars, but with a good screenplay and beautiful set design, I think it may have some of a chance.My Grade: A-"
"If you want an original movie with a good story and a great cast (who doesn't?) then look no further than ""Knives out.""This movie is obviously going to appeal most to those that love mysteries/whodunnits, but it does turn the idea on its head and doesn't take itself to seriously. Making for a gripping, unpredictable story that should appeal to most.The movie is unique, rewards you for paying attention and is so crammed with great actors that there should be someone for everyone in there. Quality."

"After the underwhelming The Last Jedi, Johnson's latest film completely redeems him. This film was fantastic. All of the characters were realistic, great acting, plot was unpredictable and unique. Only flaw was Craig's accent, Tom Hanks would've been better in the role."
"This was like a breath of fresh air! Like Clue meets Agatha Christie. Every actor played their part perfectly, & thoroughly entertaining."
"If you go to see a film to look for critique, goofs and bloopers, then go to see this film. If you go to see a film for a good night out, then go to see this film. You'll be so wowed by the story line and it's wonderful laugh out loud moments, that you will just enjoy the film for what it is. 2 hours and 10 minutes of pure joy. Mr Craig's southern American drawl accent that is only dropped once, is quite endearing and who would know that there is a condition whereby you throw up if you lie? I can not remember being entertained so much and thoroughly recommend it."
"I thoroughly enjoyed this film! A great cast and top-notch script. A rare combination of wit, style, and heart. A star-making performance by Ana de Armas, and a wonderfully weird turn by Daniel Craig."
"I expected big things and it more than met those expectations it had everything twists, drama, comedy and edge of your seat moments a perfect whodunit and one I didn't guess in the first parts of the film for a change kept you guessing until the near end. The whole cast were phenomenal but Ana De Armas and Chris Evans in particular shine! A fantastic film by a fantastic director. Refreshing to see some originality and a fresh perspective on a detective thriller."
"Excellent plot , excellent acting , a really good film , Daniel Craig really goid"
It was nice and funny! 🤘👍 Didn't expect Captain America is there. 🤣 I also suspected that grandpa is still alive. the thrill was so great.
"SPOILERS...Saying anything about Knives Out risks being a spoiler, including saying that ""saying anything about Knives Out risks being a spoiler."" So don't read anything about it before your first viewing.Here I will say just a few words, focusing on one significant aspect of Knives Out which is an extraordinarily entertaining and clever film.What recent films can Knives Out be compared to? Coincidentally (and I think it is coincidentally but remarkably) it is Get Out. Get Out took horror film ideas and played them masterfully, but also made us uncomfortable by using them to look at ourselves. Get Out definitely changed how I saw the world, and I hope it changed how I behaved as well.Knives Out similarly draws attention to how we interact with those less well off than us. It begins in the home of a rich family, with a wealthy author who has really produced something of worth, and his no-good family who have coasted on his wealth but believe they are deserving of that wealth. There are two servants, forgettable people who float around in the background and are sometimes very patronisingly treated as ""friends"". The similarity between the treatment of these two, and the treatment of the boyfriend in Get Out is striking. You no doubt remember ""I would have voted for Obama a third time if I could"", In Knives Out you have ""I thought you should have come to the funeral, but I was outvoted"". This line is funny, but it is powerful too. It shows how even when the servants are treated as friends, they are ""servant friends"", they are dependent on us (we hope) and so we can interact with them when we want, we can throw them a few minor rewards (a joint, an offer of a stipend) and they will keep running back to us.I live in Europe now but have lived many years in the USA and this treatment of servants, meaning immigrants who are extremely dependent on us, is precisely as depicted in Knives Out. (Europeans do this too, but this is an American film). By no means is this anthropological precision the main source of interest for Knives Out, but it intrigued me how well Rian Johnson (really a genius) was able to capture this aspect of American life. And, as you will see, it is very important to the film. It can be appreciated for the first time without observing any of this, but it becomes much richer once you do.It is noteworthy that Sleuth, one predecessor of Knives Out that is perhaps its equal was also deeply concerned with class and entitlement.I think Knives Out is a masterpiece."
"I really wanted to like this movie, so when I went to see it I was so excited. If I'm being honest at first I was a little disappointed because much of the plot was predictable or shown in the trailer. BUT THE END- a very subtle plot twist-very effective. Absolutely recommended- great movie!"
"If, at times, you draw a comparison of the movie to the movie ""Clue"", it would not be a surprise. Unlike Clue, this is true murder mystery.So often in movies like this you have a pretty good idea of how things will play out. That is not the case in this movie. Take mental notes throughout the movie. After you leave the cinema with a smile, having been truly entertained, take some time to pick the movie apart. I believe you will come up with a reason to see it a second time. I know I did! I am not going to say any more other than: See it. Take mental notes. Enjoy it. Pick it apart. See it again. Enjoy and appreciate it more the second time."
"Writing is outstanding, infused with a surprising amount of unexpected humour.
Rian Johnson has created an extremely thrilling crime drama, that uses the collective skills of its excellent cast to great effect. 'Knives Out' makes a strong case as one of the best films of the year and a definitive murder mystery for the ages.
Complete Star cast are fantastic. Daniel Craig completely throws you off with a thick and heavy Southern accent Go and watch it."
"After last jedi was simple said huge debute among people who loved or hate it,i think knives out at least will please most of the people who saw it or will watch it,it has bsiggest star cast of the year where everyone give good performances and it was good written film, i think that rian johnson should stick to this type of films and not some big budget films it would be better for him and for us"
"""Blades out of the scabbard"" ""Everyone is only willing to believe the truth they see, but the real truth is there. What you need is to distinguish between the true and false."" Today, with the decline of inferential novels, Agatha Christina and her readers still create such wonderful stories for us. Just as the film title is different from general reasoning films, the screenwriter used Marta's narrative in the first half of the film to let us stand in the perspective of God to watch the progress of this story and this human drama. But the truth we think is only what we are willing to believe. The screenwriter has brought all the audience into his narrative trap. That is, what we think is not the true truth. The story of the movie is ups and downs, and it gives me a long-lost feeling that is completely like reading an inferential novel! And after perfectly telling this story, it still satirizes the most fragile and dark thing of humanity, the bug in the first half In the end, the self-consistent and echoing of the story should be the most injured marta, she had a chance to save halan. '' Drysdale's family, the evil house of the ""Deformed House"", is the real family of halan. They only care about themselves and abandon their love. They mocked the immigration status of marta and claimed that it was like a family to marta but it was really harmful In their own interests, they will pull out the sharp blade to the weaker."
I was confused if Marta gave money to the thrombeys or she kept cause she was drinking that coffee at the end but awsome movie
"Highly entertaining, great twists & storyline, with an excellent cast. Loved it!!"
Loved one and defenetly recommend it in cinemas...
"This movie was really fun, smart and engaging. It is an extremely strong 8. Almost a 9 but the ending twist could have been handled a bit less basic."
This is a very fun movie that kept me entertained throughout.
"From Looper to Star Wars: The Last Jedi, Arian Johnson has been a filmmaker on the rise for the last number of years. Although many Star Wars fans seem to not like his addition to the Star Wars franchise, I loved it and I believe him to be one of the greatest directors out there today. My love for him as a filmmaker alone had me excited for his newest release in Knives Out. He took a step backward since his last outing, writing a directing a very small movie with a very large feel. This move was the best thing he could have possibly done for his career, because he has made one hell of a crowd pleaser. Knives Out is terrific and here's why it's worth your time.Following the death of Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer), his entire family is questioned about his sudden demise. Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig) oversees this investigation and believes there to be a lot hidden under the surface of this story. This begins the story and classic ""whodunnit"" feel. There is something that feels very tradition about this movie, with updated dialogue and very unique camerawork to make it a fantastic watch. This movie is pretty much as good as you can get with a story like this these days. I thoroughly enjoyed watching Knives Out.I can praise Rian Johnson for writing a clever screenplay that keeps you on the edge of your seat, which is does, or I can gush about the precise cinematography that is incredibly well-done, but this film is held together by an insanely talented cast who are all having a blast. If not for this stellar cast committing to these wacky and hilarious characters, then Knives Out would have been pretty boring. This movie benefits from the comedy and I think this cast has a lot to do with that. With that said, this film isn't quite perfect.Even though nitpicking a movie like this is kind of ridiculous, due to the nature of it needing to contain twists and turns, I have to admit that the movie is slightly predictable, even though it leads you to believe it's not. Without ruining anything, it becomes fairly obvious where things will go after a certain point, so that was a detriment for me. Thankfully, the way everything is presented is very clever and definitely showcases the reveals in ways you're not expecting. Even if you figure out what happened, you won't be able to predict how it happened, and I really appreciated that aspect.In the end, Knives Out has a nice blend of suspense and comedy to keep almost audiences engaged. I found this blend to be great and would happily revisit these characters again in the future. With fantastic writing and directing by Rian Johnson and a cast that's giving their all in the funnest way possible, it's hard not to like this one. For fans of murder mysteries, comedies, or even any of these performers, I highly recommend checking out Knives Out."
"What did i just watchheedddd?????
OMG that a masterpiece"
They took the Clue board game and out it on the big screen!
I found it very entertaining! I enjoy watch this film! 👍👍👍
"Ransom has inherited the captain's usual style, Chris' role is really good!"
"Wow! I loved that! Phenomenal though out, what an amazing cast, huuuge fan"
"Knives Out tells the story of a detective named Benoit Blanc(Daniel Craig), who investigates the death of Harlan Thrombey(Christopher Plummer), the patriarch of the Thrombey family.Knives Out is a mind-blowing film. Writer-director Rian Johnson has given us a very unique whodunit movie, that has elements of comedy & drama, apart from being a suspense thriller. When you think you know what's going to happen, something absolutely different happens. It is delightfully unpredictable. The performances are the highlight of the film. Daniel Craig is spectacular as Benoit Blanc. Craig nails the southern American accent. Chris Evans is outstanding as Ransom Drysdale. It is awesome to see Evans play a character that is in stark contrast to Captain America, the role he's known for worldwide. Ana de Armas is the star of the show as Marta Cabrera. Ana de Armas portrays a variety of emotions with aplomb & has a very long & bright career ahead of her. Jamie Lee Curtis is fantastic as Linda Drysdale. Michael Shannon is amazing as Walt Thrombey. Don Johnson is awesome as Richard Drysdale. Toni Collette is brilliant as Joni Thrombey. LaKeith Stanfield is great as Lieutenant Elliott. Christopher Plummer is superb as Harlan Thrombey. Katherine Langford is impressive as Meg Thrombey. Jaeden Martell is effective as Jacob Thrombey. Riki Lindhome, Edi Patterson, Frank Oz, K Callan & Noah Segan are good as Donna Thrombey, Fran, Alan Stevens, Greatnana Wanetta & Trooper Wagner, respectively. Knives Out is a must watch. One of the best movies of the year. Go & have a whale of a time!"
""" Knives Out "" is really an intriguing whodunit mystery- thriller movie, with refreshing twists and turns. Daniel Craig, Chris Evans , Ana De Armas, and the rest of the ensemble cast have given genuinely good performances. The director has also made the movie in a brilliant style. The screenplay is very well plotted, and keeps viewers interested and involved from the beginning till the end.The locations are also great, and blend very well with the atmosphere required in a murder mystery movie. The dialogues of "" Knives Out "" have also been very well written. My favorite dialogue is when Chris Evans comments "" What are you? CSI - KFC? ""I highly recommend this movie - a must- watch for everyone."
Damn good movie but I figured out the butler did it like 5 minutes in.
"If we cut out the occasionally not-so-subtle jokes and dialogue about politically meta talking points, Craig's parodical Foghorn Leghorn accent (I'm still unsure if it's intentionally bad or not, I think it is), and the puke gimmick, I'd give this a solid 9 if not 9.5. Accidental genius? Perhaps. But still, the end product somehow shines.I hated the Last Jedi, a film which made me question the sanity of its writer-director. I'm beginning to think that Rian had some inner passive-aggressivity with Jar Jar Abrams or someone else that loved Star Wars, and that he knew exactly what he was doing by ruining the continuity of Star Wars with Episode XIII, because this film is pretty darn good despite the flaws aforementioned. Dare I say, well worth watching.Still avoiding TROS like the plague, but Knives Out is actually not a misfire."
"Some people just don't know what a good movie is, either they just try to do 1/10 to get attention or they simply just don't know what a good movie is and to that I have to say rewatch and learn it morons"
"Wether it is for leading role or supporting role, please give an Oscar nomination to Ana de Armas.I have seen her before in films, like War Dogs and this is the performance of her career.The Golden Globe voting is happening right now, so there is a good chance for her. Also considering that there is a strong push for diversity among the nominations, her Cuban background should help.Excellent screenplay, producing and directing by Rian Johnson. Silver Spring, Maryland has produced some great people.Excellent acting by al truly all-star cast: Christopher Plummer, Daniel Craig, Chris Evans, Jamie Lee Curtis, Michael Shannon, Don Johnson, Toni Collette and others.But . . . please give some consideration to Ana de Armas for a well deserved nomination. it is my humble request."
"The conceit is that someone injected with 100 mg of morphine IV would die in 8 minutes: our patriarch is able to plan how to absolve his nurse who injected him with that much in that 8 minute span, and commit his final act to seal the deal.In fact, someone injected with 100 mg of morphine would be immediately incapacitated, and would die of oxygen starvation as a result of his not breathing, due to suppression of his respiratory center by the morphine sulfate, in around 8 minutes or so. She is later called a ""good nurse"": a good nurse would have recognized immediately if she had overdosed a patient with morphine, and there would have been no argument about calling for help, at least not from the patient.but once you get past that sniveling detail, the movie is great. has lots of twists and turns, and is genuinely entertaining. and to hear that accent from Craig is just hilarious. his dialect coach had his work cut out for him.Seeing Jamie Lee Curtis had me scurrying to the mirror, and sadly, it has happened to me, too."
"After giving us the godawful Star Wars movie The Last Jedi, I was ready to get my knives out for anything directed by Rian Johnson, but I was pleasantly surprised by this engrossing, star-studded whodunit. While its twists aren't always unpredictable, the film is still a whole lot of Agatha Christie-style fun, as private detective Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig) tries to unravel the mystery behind the death of wealthy novelist Harlan Thrombey, with numerous suspects among his family and staff.Is Harlan's Guatamalan caregiver Marta (Ana de Armas) responsible for her boss's death as she believes, or is someone else guilty? As the plot unfolds, one becomes convinced that Marta is simply a pawn, but quite who is making all the moves remains unclear until the very end, when all the pieces are finally put together by Blanc. It's an enjoyable ride, and there's more fun to be had after the film has finished in trying to remember all the plot twists and see if they check out. I'm satisfied that they do.With such a great cast (Jamie Lee Curtis, Toni Colette, Don Johnson, Chris Evans, Michael Shannon), the performances are solid, and everyone looks like they're having a whale of a time with the old-style murder/mystery shenanigans. If you push all thoughts of The Last Jedi out of your mind (a big ask, I grant you), there's a good chance you'll have a good time too.7.5/10, rounded up to 8 for IMDb."
"I'm glad Rian Johnson had the chance to come back to very much his own story after the Star Wars VIII controversy. While I enjoyed his take on the franchise, there are many who don't seem to want fresh takes (at least in the main saga). Knives Out certainly delivered the film I'd been waiting for since the Last Jedi; the next new thing Johnson was working on. It certainly borrows various visuals and general ideas from classic murder mysteries (Poirot and the like), it unfolds quite differently as a movie, which works in its favour for sure. I don't want to say much at all for fear of spoilers, but I will say that the characters (both in casting and in their interactions with one another) bring this film to one of the best of the year. Watch it!"
"A lot of people had issues with Star Wars: The Last Jedi but I absolutely loved it. Then again, I've rated Rian Johnson since he came onto the scene with Brick and later followed up with a smart science fiction thriller in Looper. Knives Out by trailer didn't look lik anything amazing although a ""whodunnit?"" is always fun. Reviews seemed very positive and it is all warranted. This one comes with a unique way of solving the crime and its humor and ensemble cast make for an entertaining watch.
The film is about the death of a very wealthy novelist. Initially, his death is deemed to be a suicide but a renown detective with a bizarre southern accent named Benoit Blanc is suspicious and thinks that the man was murdered by his family. His family members appear to be hiding more than they seem and clues come one by one. However, its not a simple case of murder and the circumstances leading to the death are very unique and no as forward as it seems. Interestingly enough, Ana de Armas takes a huge role here as a lead character.
I think the film should be commended for its storytelling. Its not like other films where you have to wait till the end to make your decision on who the culprit was. In a way the film is more transparent than that but also still very elusive. The hallmark of a good film is how its just engaging throughout through a sharply written script that thrives on its humor and call backs to films of the past in the same genre. I loved seeing de Armas in a lead role. Wanted to see a lot more of her ever since Knock Knock. Daniel Craig also turns in a memorable performance.
This is definitely worth a watch also for its truly great ensemble cast. None of the family are particularly likeable and its supposed to be that way. Whatever grudges you may have had against Johnson for The Last Jedi should be freshly bowled over because Knives Out is a smartly entertaining film that is capping of a rather great year in film. Impressive stuff.
8/10"
"This is the best murder mystery movie I've seen since Shutter Island, it had me guessing till the end. One of the best overall cast I have seen in a long while and each person played their role well."
"Stellar performances from an ensemble cast with insane on-screen chemistry, great direction, and a whodunit for our times, Rian Johnson's Knives Out is one of 2019's best with some wholly relevant story about family and politics.Boasting a talented cast, it goes without saying Knives Out wouldn't be a spectacular triumph if not for the three leads of Daniel Craig, Chris Evans, and Ana de Armas. Evans, playing Hugh ""Ransom"" Drysdale, is a ridiculous mixture of unlikable and smoothness. Craig, playing Benoit Blanc, is hilarious as a detective with a thick southern accent. Armas, playing Marta Cabrera, grounds the film through her warmhearted portrayal of Marta's honest, firm, and ultimately good character. The rest of the cast do not disappoint and give dynamite performances of the fewer screen time they receive which includes Christopher Plummer, and Jamie Lee Curtis, to name a few.Central to Knives Out is the death of the family's patriarch, Harlan Thrombey, but the film is truly about a dysfunctional family and a satire about wealth and inheritance. Though Knives Out seemingly reveals Harlan's killer even before the finale, the writing uses the early reveal as a springboard for exploring the family dynamics between the Thrombeys and Marta, showing how each of the Thrombeys are inherently selfish despite their good front. When the will reading shockingly reveals that Harlan left his entire possessions to Marta, the Thrombeys immediately turn on her, except Ransom, and their true attitude is revealed by calling her names and making unfounded accusations of unduly influencing Harlan's will. This is exemplified by previous dialogues hinting that Marta is a mere afterthought to the family such as when individual Thrombeys claim they wanted her to be present at the funeral but were outvoted and not knowing her true country of origin. Through the whirlwind of losing not only an employer but a close friend and family by choice, Marta grows from a demure and devoted nurse to the strong and caring heir of Harlan's possessions.Knives Out isn't the traditional whodunit were the identity of the murderer is clear only in the end. Multiple faints, clues, and surprises makes Knives Out unique in the genre by seemingly throwing out the central mystery, when in actuality each scene is made for characters to grow. The journey, and the not the end, is basically the film's overarching thought. The complexity of the script requires repeat viewings because the hefty themes and minute character is buried underneath the murder mystery. When the ending reveals that Harlan caused his own death, though instigated by Ransom, that moment gives better clarity to the family dynamics explored by the film. People feel entitled to inheritance and will do anything to claim them.Rian Johnson is at home in Knives Out. Everything about the direction is firing on all cylinders. The film shifts from recollection to plot progression seamlessly. Not a second is wasted or feel dragging. Setting the film in a mansion evoking old money adds visual representation to the themes. The cinematography and music are also topnotch.Not only is Ana de Armas insanely beautiful, but talented as well. Hoping to see her in bigger and better roles. Lastly, give us more of Daniel Craig southern accent roles!10/10"
"Whodunit movies are the best for me. It reminded me of movies from Agatha Christie's books. The plot and the twist, the scenery, the humor, the suspense... I can't even...! A big must for mystery lovers."
"Ladies and gentleman, Rian Johnson has done it! He cracked the formula of Agatha Christie's novels! In fact, what he did is more true to the core of these novels than recent adaptations like The Orient Express.The whodunnit story, even with all its twists and turns, is quite logical. There's no impossible coincidence, impossibly-clever mastermind, incredible timing or other deus ex machina tropes.Daniel Craig is also superb. His pompous Benoit Blanc detective, with his peculiar accent and mannerisms is really a better Hercule Poirot than Kenneth Branagh's actual Porot in the Orient Express, which was a caricature.Above all, this appears to a film everyone involved really enjoyed making it.In this age of superheroes and explosions and mindless action, Knives Out stands out. I really wish there were more like it."
"Some good reasons to spend 2h10 'on watching Knives Out:
A good script that praises the beauty of a kind heart, with continuous knots from the beginning to the end, with the dream cast from classic movies like The Sound of Music, James Bond , Captain America, True Lies...A good detective is not only interested in finding the truth but also knows what to do with it.The image of the coffee cup with the words ""..."" appearing at the beginning & the end of the film is exquisite.Anyone who likes detective movies should check it out to play the guessing game who did what before the secret is revealed."
"Breaths new life into the classic Who-dunnit we know and love. The audience is taken on a literal twist of a plot where the conventional order we experience mysteries is flipped inside out in a way that is both deeply original and yet still pays homage to the classics that inspire it. A story blended with both comedy and suspense in a well-balanced cocktail of fun. If you'd like you could go deeper and also find some political undertones - but those were happily lost on me and the story was fun enough to be left well alone from the upper-class commentary. Seems to rush its final act and some of the details don't fully make sense to me, but still left satisfied. 8.2 / 10"
I grew up watching the mystery show Murder she wrote starring Angela Lansbury in the 90s. Currently I watched the movie Clue before seeing this movie and I was just astonished from the beginning to end so enjoyable.
"I went alone by myself in cinema this night. My impresions: It kept me interested and excited through hole story, plot is really twisted and the end is really impressive tho!My best recommendations!"
"I was curious about this movie because they have big great cast and the trailer looks convincing to see this flick, so I gave it a shot! Wow, what a movie! You'll keep guessing And your mind will wander from start until finish, great for moviegoers who likes mystery, go see it!"
". . . KNIVES OUT is a sure-fire crowd pleaser. Focusing on the infighting, back-stabbing and nefarious shenanigans of the typical wan Majority Culture too-rich Thrombley Clan, KNIVES OUT embodies the scriptural injunction that ""The Teak shall inherit the Earth"" (and we all know what shade THAT is!). Spawned by a Statue-of-Liberty inspired refugee family, ""Marta"" convinces ""Harlan""--the scion of a $60 million miser's money mound--that her little finger is worth more than all two tons of his eight closest leeching relatives crammed into a dump truck. Though only one of these deluded descendants puts into motion a murder plot when Harlan makes it clear that he's disowning his greedy pig trough slurping blood kin in favor of the kind, hard-working Marta, it's obvious that each of the other seven corrupt Creatures of Privilege would gladly twist knives in BOTH Harlan and Marta to keep the Rain of Filthy Lucre showering down upon themselves. Fortunately, KNIVES OUT concludes with the Teak inheriting everything, which is an event looming just around America's corner in Real Life!"
"The score is perfect, I mean it is so good and thrilling. Craig was fantastic with his CSI: KFC accent. This cast is perfect, I mean Jamie Lee Curtis!!! I love how Rian Johnson made this whodunnit movie in his own way. The scenes in the house were more interesting than the scenes outside and the problem is there are little too much scenes outside. I was not very surprised by ending in fact I expected that conclusion but neither the less this movie is worth watching and is one of the best movies of this year."
"I enjoyed this movie, especially going in not knowing anything beyond it being a ""Clue"" type movie.
Daniel Craig put on a wonderful performance."
"A billionaire author(Christopher Plummer) suddenly dies from an apparent suicide, and all his relatives come in hopes to hearing a reading of the will. But soon a brilliant detective(Daniel Craig) starts to see there is more to his death then what meets the eye.Writer/Director Rian Johnson really delivers an Agatha Christie like mystery, that keeps an interest with it's all star cast, Don Johnson, Jamie Lee Curtis, Toni Collette, Michael Shannon, and Chris Evans to name a few. My only real complaint is Daniel Craig, some scenes he's good, and other scenes he's annoyingly over the top, to the point I feel he was giving a parody like performance. But all in all still a good mystery, just when you think you know where it's headed and then it will really surprise you."
"It had me hooked from start to finish, nothing was left unturned."
"Excellent film excellent casting
Chris evans and daniel craig do amazing jop
Unexpeted ending Iwould to see more film from this two actor in the future away from captin america and james bond"
Very fun who done it film just like you would expect. Great cast and a lot of good twist. Some you can see coming others you don't.
"If you've ever been caught up with a Will dispute then you'll recognize the characters in this one. All entitled, despicable, small minded and always, always, ALWAYS bickering. Sounds like a family reunion to me!
As a murder mystery this is a bit slow on the start with Daniel Craig playing the small time country lawy--- errrrr detective Benoit Blanc who was hired to solve the case.
Some decent twists and turns, a juicy red herring and good intentions that pave the way to hell.
It comes with a really big finish saving the best for the last. Overall this one it fun with very grounded family dynamics considering the type of family this is."
8 Stars. When I watched the trailer I didn't think there was a way this movie could break the 8 star barrier but after I watched I was wrong. The movie is highly engaging not predictable and all around a blast. I was never bored.
"Halfway through the movie, I thought the filmmakers had boxed themselves in and I was wondering how they would get out of it....it is a testament to them, the writers and the stellar cast that not only do they make it work, they make it work in style. If you think you know how the plot will unfold, trust me, you have no idea!"
"Dialogue heavy, murder mystery, thriller.Told in flash-back and the style of an Agatha Christie murder mystery.
A famous crime novelist is found dead at his country estate just after his 85th birthday, the cops are already there interviewing the family but there's also a charming private investigator sleuth who has been mysteriously solicited to piece together the evidence and uncover the truth behind the novelist's apparent 'suicide'.Modern-day whodunit with a fantastic cast where everyone is a suspect, everyone has a motive. Highly recommended."
"The movie is fun to watch. It kept you glued to the seat. The audience in the theater were disappointed to see an interval.
One is assured of entertainment watching this movie."
"If they were to give it a go, this movie should justifiably be Rian's redemption from the harshest of his previous critics. For this is a really entertaining film. I found myself smiling with glee through a sizable proportion of the running time.Multi-millionaire crime-fiction author Harlan Thrombey (the wonderful Christopher Plummer) is celebrating his 85th birthday with three generations of his family in his ""Cludo-like"" mansion. But all is not well with the family harmonic and the next morning Harlan is found dead in his room by his nurse Marta (Ana de Armas). Apparently, it's a suicide, but when private detective Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig) arrives on the scene he starts turning over stones ""oin seearch ov tha troooth"" (sic) and dark secrets begin to emerge.Key to success of this Agatha Christie-style movie is a dense portmanteau cast and a well-plotted script. Both are here present.In terms of the cast, this is another candidate for the SAG Ensemble Cast award. For the cast is suitably stellar with Chris ""Cap"" Evans, Toni Collette, Michael Shannon, Jamie Lee Curtis and Don Johnson vying for the top billing with Craig and Plummer. They bounce off each other joyously, with Collette taking my prize for top acting kudos. She's just deliciously over the top as the scheming hippy chick with the rasping voice and the cutting one-liners.With a starring role is Cuban bombshell Ana de Armas, here notching down the glamour to play the plainly dressed nurse. But she has a magnetic screen presence and is perfectly cast as the girl at the heart of all the action. She has the doe-eyed innocence that Alfred Hitchcock was always looking for in his leading ladies. Interestingly, she is soon to appear with Craig again as Bond-girl Paloma in ""No Time to Die"".Elsewhere in the cast are some interesting cameos: the family's lawyer is none other than Frank ""Yoda"" Oz; and the ancient security guard is M. Emmet Walsh, who has an amazing filmography going back to the late 60's.Writer/director is clearly his 'thing'. But Rian Johnson here pulls off a neat trick with the script which is brilliantly twisty and turny and 100% entertaining. Although it's presented as cuts between the 'present time' and versions of the night in question, the whole doughnut is never entirely in view until the final reel. It's a satisfying story, and some of the dialogue is laugh-out-loud funny.A nice plot point is the inability for young Marta to tell a lie without vomiting. Wouldn't the UK General Elections be Sooooo much more colourful if that was a general trait!!I've only the one real criticism of the movie, and that's Daniel Craig's appalling Southern drawl. It's really quite distracting. Aside from some witty lines of dialogue (""What is this? CSI KFC?"") nothing would have been lost to cast him as an urbane English detective instead. They could have slipped in some Brexit jokes instead! I appreciate Craig wants to distance himself from Bond somewhat. He did the same thing as Joe Bang in ""Logan Lucky"". But - sorry - it didn't really work for me then and it doesn't work now either.In summary, this is a really fun movie that a whole family with older children (the rating is 12+) can go and enjoy together. There's limited violence; limited swearing and sexual innuendo; and no sex (save for the Hitler youth in the bathroom!). But there is a whole lot of sleuthing fun to be had. Bravo Mr Johnson, bravo! For that reason it comes with a bob-the-movie-man ""Highly recommended"" tag.(For the full graphical review please check out the One Mann's Movies review on the web or Facebook. Thanks)."
"This movie says its a nod to classic Agatha Christie -style detective stories. This is pretty much exactly what this movie is in reality. The story is more funny than it's dramatic, but in the end you like and hate the right characters. Casting is mostly spot on and the rest of it is not an issue in the big picture. Parts of the plot are quite easy to guess in advance, but the movie has multiple ""big reveals"" and several more little once, so it does not really matter if you guessed some of it pretty early on (and even if you did, you never could be totally sure...)."
"Very, very boring. Go see Midway. Go see Midway !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
I dont know why there are some low reviews out there but I found the movie quite interesting and smartly made! Would watch it again and strongly recommend.
"Good storytelling.
sense of humor.
excited ending.
you can feel ur heart beats faster.
describes human instinct very nicely."
"The cast was superb, and the cinematography and production were great. It was hilarious and the twists and turns kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time. I loved it."
"I'm so glad I went to see that movie, absolutely a must watch, and take your friends they're gonna love it."
"This is by far the best movie of 2019 and better than any other movie in the past 5 years. It keeps you guessing perfectly the whole movie and is a fun ride the whole time. A must see for any fan of movies, especially if you like murder mystery movies."
Fantastic movie! Far better than your average murder in mystery. Many twists and turns that keep you on the edge of your seat.
"Going into the movie, I was not expecting some comedy in the film. I find the slight comedy to be really refreshing and was surprised by all the twists and turns in the story. The movie had a nice, but unexpected ending. Watch it to find out. :)"
"Loved how the movie was built without escalating things too quickly, the actors really played their roles and were in character"
"We hadn't gone to the movies much lately, then we saw Midway, which we enjoyed, and then Ford v Ferrari which we enjoyed even more, and now Knives Out which we had heard was even better than the first two. They were right.It's a joy to be entertained by this ensemble from Daniel Craig, as Benoit Blanc, to Ana de Armas, as Marta, and everyone in between. They make those old Agatha Christie movies seem under-played and not very carefully cast, which is saying a lot. Without digging into this film's origins I very much doubt we'll ever see a sequel with a plot anywhere as good as this one. This movie is richly wrought and overwhelmingly satisfying and the only negative thing I have to say about it is just that, there's almost no chance of a worthy sequel."
This is an intelligent and witty version of Cluedo in film that is entertaining throughout. The cast are tremendous especially Daniel Craig depicted as a Southern American detective hired to crack the case. The ending was also unpredictable which for this day in age is an achievement.
"After getting unnecessary fan-hate after directing The Last Jedi, Rian Johnson returned to the big screen to direct a murder mystery like no other. And I feel like I'm comfortable saying this is close to a crime thriller masterpiece. Filled with earned twists and turns, incredible character depth, meticulous direction, and a wonderful time at the movies for all ages. And if I'm not mistaken, this was Ana de Armas' first true starring role, and she absolutely nailed it. She is a star in the making. If you're able to standout in a cast with Captain America, Laurie Strode, General Zod, and James Bond, throw in legends like Don Johnson & Christopher Plummer, with Toni Collette, LaKeith Stanfield, Katherine Langford, and Jaeden Martell, you know you have serious talent. That's how good de Armas is. I can't wait to rewatch this one.9.5/10"
"This movie is a jewel in the crown of great mainstream 2019 cinema. So funny and everyone does a marvelous job with their characters Don Johnson's having a nice year between this and The Watchmen,Toni, Michael, and Jamie Lee do fantastic as usual!) For me though the stars were Daniel Craig and Chris Evans; Craig's accent alone is a feat (those brits r so talented when it comes to American accents) plus his ""donut monologues are memorable. Evans is more than a Marvel character and I hope this film reiterates that. This is a film I will own when it's released on blu ray because I'm compelled to continue to watch it."
"This movie's quirkiness and ability to twist viewers even if you were paying close attention, enthralled me with enjoyment til the very end.Daniel Craig sold me on the carry with the whole joke of his character is that he's a Sherlock Holmesesque character, but since Daniel Craig is already British, (this is just a theory) they took us for a loop for Daniel Craig with a Southern Drawl to make it ironic since this film is just filled with irony."
"Knives out is a murder mystery which is better than the average murder mystery.For a start the cast list of Knives Out is excellent. This includes Daniel Craig as Benoit Blank who is hired to investigate the murder of the rich patriarch Harlon Thrombey played by the great Christopher Plummer. As you watch the movie you come up with your own ideas of who is behind the murder. I guyess some of my ideas were right and some were wrong, but the clues are all in the movie if you are clever enough to pick them up.An enjoyable watch although the movie probably will not lose much when it is shown on the small screen."
"Without the classiness of Evil Under the Sun, without the slicked-back elegance of Murder on the Orient Express (1974, Albert Finney, thank you), without the slapsticks of Clue, without the wryly wrought gesticulations of Columbo, and without, in reasonable estimation, any further need for a fresh take on the genre of murder-mystery movies, Rian Johnson has, in a generally self-aggrandizing way, assembled a star-studded cast of loathsome characters to act out farcical intrigue crossing the finish line through a crisp 130 minutes of obfuscation-cum-revelation, or maybe it was all just Quentin Tarantino's tenth film?Although that all sounds positive, and Christopher Plummer continues to prove he can command the screen despite never having been in a Star Wars movie, something which neither Christopher Lee, Peter Cushing, Alec Guinness, nor Max von Sydow can add to their resumes, one cannot help but question the choice of Daniel Craig as a southern gentleman with folksy dialogue and an almost laughable attempt at a Texas drawl.A lot of laughs were left on the table by not imbuing the main detective with funnier features. Imagine a French (or perhaps, Flemish) accent, a monocle, a lazy eye, a large gut, a handlebar mustache, jet-black and slicked-back hair under a hairnet, a double limp, two humps, and some pocket watches which are never accurate unless you want to know what time it is in Flanders.It was a very good choice to have Chris Evans wear civilian clothes, however."
"Really enjoyable, if slightly overpraised (at the moment) for my money, murder mystery from Rian Johnson.Acclaimed author Harlan Thromby (Christopher Plummer) dies on the night of his birthday party at his stately home. Though seemingly suicide, the celebrated amateur detective Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig) believes it may be something more sinister - particularly when he learns that Thromby has recently been putting his estate in order, which would prove costly for his lazy ruthless trust-fund family.There's an awful lot to like about ""Knives Out"". It's an all-star cast, and the performances generally live up to that billing; even if, rather by the necessity of time, some of them don't feature very much. The script is also very funny, with several laugh out loud lines - though I wouldn't go as far as calling ""Knives Out"" a comedy and definitely not a parody of a ""whodunit"". I do like to see a murder mystery on the big screen again, as a genre it's rather fallen out of favour, or been resigned to the television - I don't think we've had a big screen one since ""Murder on the Orient Express"". Once you get used to Daniel Craig's accent, it's easier to warm to the character (in fact I'd like to see another Benoit Blanc mystery at some point in the future).One criticism is true of the genre, rather than specifically this film. Given that I now know what happened that night, I don't think I'm going to need to see the film again any time soon, if ever. There isn't much replay value to it.Specific to this film though, at its conclusion I felt like I wanted more. There are a number of twists, but they revolve around the characters that we're left with and I think I'd have preferred a cleverer version that involved a few more of the rest of the family in some capacity. I do accept that this is a delicate balancing act though, and too many twists for the sake of it might have driven the film into farce.That said, for the two hours you're in the cinema with ""Knives Out"" it's a great time."
"I saw the movie yesterday... it was a very nice funny over the top acted B movie ...
Toni collette was the best ... really funny actress to give all those lines with straight face Is amazing..."
"The subversion model is not something which is intrinsically wrong. It was, howver, wrong and in bad taste for the star wars franchise. It's not that the last Jedi was solely bad because of this thematic mitch match. It discontinued character temperaments, made up cheap plot get-arounds, had disinteresting characters, and construct useless and artificial conflicts. All those flaws are either absent or rotated to compliment the characters and plot of this movie.
Everything from the set-up to the conflict to the twist is so tight and clear. The various motives and reservations of the various characters are communicated and expressed perfectly by the actors (I forgot Daniel Craig was this good) and the script. The plot is interesting. The clues in this movie are plenty and you'll have a fun time piecing it together as you go. You'll also have fun realizing which clues were indicative and which were red herrings as you enjoy the twist. The entire movie is rich with sardonic self-awareness. The political mockery is not the one-sided anti-conservative orthodoxy in Hollywood and has some genuinely hilarious jokes that conservative can connect with and laugh at. I haven't been able to say that in my lifetime (I'm 18). However, the political stuff is about 2 dials too high and gets caught in this weird 2016 memetic world. The kid is called a ""alt-right Nazi"" and his sister a ""crypto-marxist"". Yes, alt right and were both in this movie. I get that he wants to make fun of what he sees as laughable aspects of both of those groups, but, come on, Ryan, don't date the movie THAT much. Regardless, this movie is not political so it's actually not a big deal
As for the main character, I have been subverted on the female lead Mary Sue trope. She has flaws which manifest in faults which themselves work to move the plot which all completes her arc of timidnesses to confidence. The characters get what they deserve given the nature of their actions. Things are entertaining and funny. The plot and arc makes sense. It's good. Don't be dissuaded because it's rian johnson."
"Well crafted. Good plot and sane twists.Ana De Armas is amazing at her part and it was definitely nice seeing Evans playing the bad guy after all the avengers hype.Craig is very ""Poirot-y"" and not so much ""Holmes-y"" but his character works just fine."
"This movie is a brilliant blend of stellar acting, cheeky humor, and intrigue. A Clue game brought to life, and not sparing an ounce of drama or delight.Given the genre, you know there's going to be a few twists. The delight comes from trying to figure out how and when the twists will be delivered, and seeing how on or off the mark you were at predicting them. Engaging until the end."
Okay so the trailer says 'perfect family film' okay well this is i not so if you take young kids youll find out in about 5 to 10 minutes of the movie you made a big mistake the movie is marvelous dont get me wrong i laughed i love the drama excitement everything to do with it just dont listen to the trailers
"Knives Out brings the Agatha Christie style whodunit murder mystery into the modern age in a way that both pays homage to the obvious inspiration as well as being its own original thing. Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer) is a successful crime novelist with an extended family with whom he has a variety of issues. When he dies private detective Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig) is hired by an unknown person to solve the case of the apparent suicide. The plot thickens when it is revealed that Marta Cabrera (Ana de Armas), Harlan's nurse and friend has received the entire inheritance in Harlan's will and is offered assistance by family misfit Ransom Drysdale (Chris Evans). Without going into too much detail the film is well written, clever and fun, managing to bring new twists and developments to an often done genre. Most everyone in the star studded cast gives an impressive performance, especially Craig. I recommend seeing it while it's still in theaters."
"The story is too simple that the first moment of the important clue (medicine bottle) show up, and I got the answer. It is a little bit upset, since my expectations is a more complicated story with complicated characters relationships as Murder on the Orient Express"
"Fully packed with excitement, wonderful cast, very interesting script, full of humours, and sarcastic. Though it's not entirely type of Sherlock Holmes movie, but the thrilling and mysterious enough to hold the audience attached to the screen. And surprisingly funny, with a satisfied twist at the end. Good people deserves to win."
"What a great first half of a film a star studded line up and i loved all the setting up of what could of been a cool whodunnit .....? But then it just got messy and lost its way and over complicated the whole film , at the end i just felt frustrated that the second half failed to be as cool as the first ....... Meh 6/10 .....!!!!!"
"Here's my review of ' Knives out ' . So knives out is directed by Rian Johnson, the guy who directed the infamous Last Jedi , but the movie I know him from his ' Looper ' which is quite awesome and made me look forward to this movie as well . The story is about the death of a mystery writer followed by a real time cluedo game with his family. If you've read enough Agatha Christie and Harry Potter you're gonna put the pieces in a matter of seconds , for those of you didn't , you'll have fun . What I loved about it was how they revealed the mystery a few mins into the movie and yet spun a tight web around it . The movie stars an ensemble cast of Daniel craig , Chris Evans , Michael Shannon , Ana de Armas and many more , the huge cast wasn't a marketing stunt and every character had a purpose followed by proper screen time , they were like the pilot episode of a great sitcom, being likeable characters at first sight . The movie is also beautifully shot and masterfully edited and I bet it's getting nominated for an academy for any of those . I also liked how the movie was able to tonally shift seemlessly from one part murder mystery parody to one part black comedy to one part thriller , and Rian Johnson handles that like a pro . My only gripes with this movie was Daniel Craig's Foghorn Leghorn like accent which turned out to be intentional and pointed out towards the end . So with great characters , edge of the seat edits , masterful shots , one liners which land and one literal cluedo game , Knives out is an instant classic and Rian Johnson's biggest apology letter for the last Jedi ."
