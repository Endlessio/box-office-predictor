"If you want to bypass the quibbles and get straight to the meat of this review, please skip to my last paragraph.The Battle of Midway is a story that's well known to most Annapolis graduates of my generation and earlier. The battle was a key inflection point in World War II, perhaps the pivotal moment changing the course of the Pacific War.Although I loved seeing Henry Fonda as Nimitz in the 1976 version of ""Midway"" (Fonda was to play Nimitz in ""In Harms Way"" as well), unfortunately, I found that movie to be surprisingly dull, historically inaccurate, unnecessarily melodramatic, and generally not very good.Because my experience is that more recent movie renderings of historical subjects usually don't improve the historical accuracy (I'm thinking of 2001's God-awful Ben Affleck ""Pearl Harbor"" vis-Ã -vis 1970's ""Tora Tora Tora""), I did not have high hopes for this new ""Midway.""I was wrong.In short, ""Midway"" is a terrific movie. Not only does it get the history (mostly) right, it's a tight, elegant, and superb rendering that does the historical figures proud. It succeeds to pack way more into its 2 hour, 18 minute run length than you can imagine. It covers the attack on Pearl Harbor, the PACFLT-Washington tension & dynamic, Nimitz's ascension to command of the Pacific, LCDR Layton's contribution to the intelligence picture, Joe Rochefort's robe-wearing genius, Yamamoto's soul-searching, Halsey's tenacity, the ascendency of naval aviation, a tiny bit of the submarine contributions to the battle, and-oh yeah-the actual battle itself, to include the incredible, unbelievable jaw-dropping (but true!) heroism of our Yorktown and Enterprise naval aviators. And it does all this justice, in a superb bit of moviemaking.Can a 26-year Navy veteran like me find nits to pick on? Of course:
I saw a few collar devices that weren't pinned on right (I'm talking about you, Layton!)At least one scene that is historical legend but didn't really happenThe substantially underrepresented submarine role in the battle (being a submariner, perhaps my biggest regret)Some Annapolis grads wearing their class ring on the wrong hand (tradition has us wearing our rings on our left hand, not the right)Sailors not ""squaring away"" their Dixie cup hats the way they would have back thenI wish the Pearl Harbor officers' club was as nice as they portrayed it in the movie!They placed a non-existent cemetery on Pearl Harbor's Hospital PointKimmel didn't watch the attack from the Pacific Fleet headquarters, he watched it from his office on the Pearl Harbor submarine base (which later became my office and is on the national register of historic places)They would not have worn their service dress khaki in the Officer's Club-- they would have worn service dress whites (chokers)The band in the O-club would have been locals not sailors (they missed an opportunity to have somebody like Gabby Pahinui playing!)But the good stuff way exceeds the nits:
They got the Pacific Fleet headquarters right-- it's not the Pearl Harbor shipyard commander's buildingThey got the torpedo failures right-- torpedoes were terrible early in the warThey got the Yorktown repair in 48 hours in Drydock 4 in the Pearl Harbor shipyard right-- the shipyard rendering was near perfectThey got the code breaking room in the basement of the PACFLT headquarters right (when I was stationed there the room was being used to store furniture and I petitioned to get it on the national register of historic places)It might have been a lot of CGI, but it was really good CGI. They rendered Pearl Harbor almost perfectly. I could even make out my Ford Island house from my time as commodore, as well as a historically accurate rendering of Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard, the Pearl Harbor submarine base, and of course, the ships and planes.Something I never thought I'd hear myself say: Woody Harrelson was superb as Nimitz. He's no Fonda, but he was understated and believable, the way I've always seen Nimitz in my mind. Not a casting idea I would have thought of, but it worked!Except for the collar device issue listed above, the uniforms were exactly right for the period, from the flat shoulder boards that were being used in that era, to the beaten-up look the ship's laundry would have given Service Dress Khaki, to the way the sailors were dressed, to the way the pilots wore their wings, etc.It even brought out the fact that movie director John Ford was on Midway doing a documentary when the battle went down. The fact that Ford volunteered for the Navy, saw battle, and was injured, while John Wayne remained (in his mind) safely at home, become a point of tension between the two men, with Ford being one of the few who felt comfortable belittling Wayne for his lack of service as the years went by.I really liked the outtro mini-bios of the real characters at the end. I didn't learn anything new there, but thought they were extremely well done.In the end the 2+ hours flew by for me. It was so good, I plan on seeing it again next weekend. What a terrific way to celebrate Veteran's Day.Of course, Roland Emmerich's prior movies have been, on the whole, simpleminded blockbusters. But this time he took a risk by doing something thoughtful, respectful, accurate, and artistic. The only way to ensure movies like this continue to be made is for the public to show we care about history and accuracy, and to make this movie a success. I very much hope it does well. Then maybe we have a chance of getting the right movie made about the Indianapolis.A final thought: I've been disgusted by many of the cynical, snarky reviews written by professional movie reviewers, many of which sneer at the bravery of the warriors depicted. Yes, the dialog in this movie is sometimes simple, tired, and trite. A few of the characters are not well developed, particularly the women. It's perfectly appropriate for reviewers to criticize elements of moviemaking. One reviewer made fun of the line of dialog where Best says ""This is for Pearl Harbor."" There is nothing silly or unreasonable about that line. You can bet one of the pilots actually said something like that that day. As somebody who survived 9/11 attack on the Pentagon, when I later went to Afghanistan, you can bet if I had the chance to do so I would have said, ""This is for Gerry DeConto,"" one of my friends who didn't make it out that day. But many these sneering reviewers have gone on to say to readers that because of these weaknesses, they should not see ""Midway."" Keep in mind that there were similar elements of Spielberg's ""Lincoln"" that could be considered inaccurate and/or over-the-top movie-making (most of the scenes depicted in Congress, for example), but on the whole the events portrayed in that movie are important for Americans to understand. Same is true here. So the point I want to make is this: a movie can have elements of poor moviemaking, and yet be an important movie for viewers to watch. ""Midway"" is one such movie. It depicts a poorly understood event in American history, but one that Americans should be exposed to. The events depicted, and the people depicted, are real. They really did these things. The bravery was real. Americans need to know this, and reviewers who have likely never risked anything in their lives should have the good graces not to sneer at those who have."
"This is an excellent historical portrayal of the Battle of Midway, and some of the events that led up to it. There is a lot of intensity throughout the film, and it shows how some of the decisions on both sides were truly a gamble in that time. There were no satellites, gps systems, or sophisticated radar systems. The only missing pieces to this movie, as noted by others, is the lack of US fighter planes. Maybe it is intended to focus mainly on the Dauntless pilots.
I took my wife and kids to see this movie, as it seems much of the history of this country is being forgotten. I am so glad I did. The kids had no idea that any of this happened.
As for the critics that wrote negative reviews and trashed this movie, I think attributes to a lot of what is wrong with this country today. People who decided not to see this movie, on Veterans Day weekend, based on the critics reviews, are truly missing an excellent movie.
This movie is historically accurate, with no lame love story, or fictional substories."
"This is probably the first time in over 50 years Hollywood made a solid war movie without inserting a sappy, contrived romantic sub-plot, pushing some radical political agenda, or re-writing history.
The movie is good. The dialogue is believable, natural, and convincingly delivered in almost all cases.While no movie is perfectly accurate historically - historians don't even agree on much, so who is to say - the few errors here are trivial and immaterial to the how events progressed. As somebody who is a buff on this period of the early Pacific war - reading every book by Prange, Lord, and many others - I was very impressed.I went into this movie expecting the worst from Hollywood, but this was their best historical piece in generations. Even the casting seemed to echo the real people in looks and demeanor.The Japanese point of view wasn't neglected either. While I can't say whether the Japanese dialogue was believable or well-delivered, by all outward appearances this acting was also top notch. The similarity between the real Admiral Nagumo and the actor was particularly striking. They made the right call in using solid Japanese actors speaking Japanese.The accurate portrayal of the friction between the Imperial Navy and Imperial Army with Emperor Hirohito almost powerless to restrain the militarists was very refreshing. This was a very important, complex contributing factor to the war. Few outside Japan and some narrow historical circles ever learn about this dynamic.About the worst I can say about this movie is the pace was too fast. Unless stretched into an 8 hour mini-series, I can't imagine they could have avoided this. With my background, I could fill in gaps and context the movie seemed to miss. Others might be left confused. Even though not well-read on this chapter of history, my spouse followed the storyline without issue and really enjoyed the movie as entertainment.Kudos to the producers, writers, actors, and entire crew. This was a job well-done and a fitting tribute to heroes like Layton and Best."
"This film is a straightforward retelling of the events in the first months of the War in the Pacific beginning with Pearl Harbor and culminating in the Battle of Midway (June 1942). In between, it also touched on Doolittle's Raid on Tokyo (April 1942) and the Battle of Coral Sea (May 1942). The story was told mainly from the point of view of two American soldiers, namely pilot Lt. Dick Best (Ed Skrein) who led his dive bomber squadron at Midway, and intelligence officer Lt. Comm. Edwin Layton (Patrick Wilson) who with his code-breaker team predicted the Midway attack.Along the way, we meet other famous American soldiers: Admiral Chester Nimitz (Woody Harrelson) Commander in Chief of the US Pacific Fleet; Vice Admiral William ""Bull"" Halsey (Dennis Quaid) who led the aircraft carrier USS Enterprise; Rear Admiral Raymond Spruance (Jake Weber) who took over the Enterprise for the Battle of Midway; Best's fellow aviators Lt. Comm. Wade McClusky (Luke Evans), Lt. Comm. Eugene Lindsey (Darren Criss) and Lt. Comm. Jimmy Doolittle (Aaron Eckhart); cryptographer Commander Joseph Rochefort (Brennan Brown) and Aviation Machinist Mate Bruno Gaido (Nick Jonas).The side of the Japanese Imperial Army and their unique military culture were also given fair screen time in this film. Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto (Etsushi Toyokawa) of the Imperial Japanese Navy and the Commander in Chief of their combined fleet, was portrayed with calm and quiet dignity. We also get to meet other Japanese officers and their own brands of leadership Rear Admiral Tamon Yamaguchi (Tadanobu Asano) who commanded the Hiryu with nobility, and Vice Admiral Chuichi Nagumo (Jun Kunimura) whose controversial battle decisions had negative impact against the Japanese campaign.The execution of the critical battle scenes are the main draws to watch this film. Director Roland Emmerich will always be remembered as the man who brought us ""Independence Day"" (1996) and ""2012"" (2009). Of course, there are big explosions and massive destruction here as well. The massive scenes showing fiery exploding seacraft and aircraft were rendered with crisp cinematography and meticulous visual effects to create impressive screen spectacles. The aviation scenes, particularly the dive bomber runs by Dick Best, were excellently staged, shot and edited to elicit an exhilarating rush.For its 2 hours 18 minute run, the story of the crucial naval battles and the heroism of its real-life protagonists were front and center here in ""Midway."" There were no fictional characters or cheesy love stories like in the first ""Midway"" film or ""Pearl Harbor."" While seeing some popular young actors like Criss or Jonas can be distracting, the all-star cast generally rendered honor and respect to the heroes they portrayed. Focusing on soldiers of lesser rank allowed for some intimate personal drama in actual battle situations, perhaps with not much depth as possible. As this movie is rated PG, so do not expect to see graphic injuries at the level of ""Saving Private Ryan."""
I am a veteran and this was a hit. The special effects were good and I don't understand why people were saying it was too much. The characters were evenly played out in the movie and there was no stupid romance part that was in the last Pearl Harbor movie. It told the story amazingly and it dived right into what it's all about. You don't need too much character development to tell a story of four people during that time. It was such a great watch and I Definatley recommend it. It ranks up there as we were soldiers! It's been a long time a good war movie came out and this was it. And when you see other reviews about it's a disgrace to veterans don't listen to those reviews. Obviously they haven't been through tough times such as how these people lived. I was in live fire so I can compare. Enjoy the movie is amazing!
"Agree with other reviewer, this is the best war movie in a long time, it went through three historical events, attack on pearl harbor, doolittle Tokyo air raid and battle of midway linked together with a human story of a dive bomber pilot, and what a great history/story telling it was.
The beginning of the massive Enterprise aircraft carrier, shaking the theater with the Dolby sound has the feel of Star War IV Battle cruiser opening scene, and a tight story line and pace ensues. The CGI is the best, you don't see AT-6 Texan painted as Zero fighters, you don't see modern warships disguised as battle-hardened WW2 ones,from this point forward I predict we will see more movies with period-correct war machines. The movie has moments that make you sigh (dud torpedo that hit but didn't explode, bombs missed after pilot braved through clouds of flaks) and cheer (bulls-eyed on the giant Sun on the deck, and chain explosion of the littered ammos because of tactic confusions), this is Hollywood at its best in rare moments, no over lingering love story, no cliche stereotyped GIs, what you have are characters in a war trying to survive, trying to outsmart the other side, and trying but dying ... you can read about those three events before or after the movie, but for me, I enjoyed a great movie, finished till the credit ends and walked out feeling great, grateful and blessed as an American."
"Critics are trashing this film, I went into it skeptical. After, I'm not so sure why. They tell a simplified story of the events leading up to, and eventually the battle of midway. You get to see two sides of life, the Japanese and the American forces. The script is fine, acting is pretty good in my opinion as well (shout out to Dennis Quaid, he is a great salty kinda guy). CGI was not that bad, especially for fast paced scenes. Only complaint is it is a bit long, which I understand due to how much they wanted to include. But there were 2-3 times I thought it might end, but there were still a few minutes left. In the end, a solid war movie that, in my opinion, does a great job showing some brutality of war, in addition to brothership and slice of life of the time. A solid film to honor the brave men and women that died for a better future."
"Midway is well made thrown back to the historical war movie epics of the 1960s and 1970s, covering a wide spectrum of elements that made up a key moment in history. It's not a perfect film, but its one of the best of its type to be made in a good long while.What MIDWAY provides us with is an ensemble piece narrative story covering events leading up to the turning point in The War In The Pacific, which was the battle of Midway. To invest us in the characters we're shown a snapshot journey of each of their lives from just before the attack on Pearl Harbour in December 1941 up until June of 1942 where the Japanese and American naval forces would try and surprise each other in what would be the battle of the films title. It's no easy feat to present us with a vast range of uniformed characters in the military, and get the viewer invested in them emotionally but the actors here to do well to make each of their characters stand out so when the film reaches its key climax we understand who is who and what their role is in the conflict. While some of the dialogue is obvious and overstated it serves the job with character dialogue scenes acting as segways from one historical stepping stone to the next as we follow the events that led up to the battle.Before I delve into the main negative, I will say overall this is a great movie which could be really enhanced by an extended edition or extra running time if if there's more scenes that were cut out covering the battle of Midway itself - and if so PLEASE PUT THEM BACK IN A LONGER CUT - PEOPLE WILL BUY IT ON BLU-RAY! This is where the main problem with this film lies. Over half of its running time is dedicated to the raid on Pearl Harbour, The Doolittle Raid and the battles leading up to and including The Coral Sea, the latter of which is told pretty much in one scene and a single VFX shot (Good though it was) - Not an issue per say, as this film is not called 'The Battle of The Coral Sea' - and while some of these scenes give much context and required emotional threads for both characters and the younger audience members alike, others really didn't need to be seen in this film. It felt as if the events surrounding the Chinese assisting the Doolittle Raid survivors was probably a condition of some VFX funding tax break for the Asian based post-production budget. An allied radio report of the raid itself, perhaps being heard by the pilots of the American carriers was really all that was needed. Whatever the reason, these scenes add little to the key story or characters involved in the subsequent battle and even though they sign post the path that led to Midway, it's not something that couldn't have been covered in a single title card at the beginning of the film. The battle of Midway itself, while well realised, is told a little too quickly. The Japanese attack on USS Yorktown is again covered in a single VFX shot with one line of dialogue from an observing carrier when it could have been such a nail biting moment. The tension that is achieved in the original movie between the Naval Commanders on both sides making the tricky tactical decisions in the battle is a little compacted here. We see the last batch of Japanese pilots taking off but we don't see the outcome of this decision nor get a sense of the damage they do to the Americans. Time spent earlier in the movie building up to events at Midway would have been better spent covering the key events of the actual battle itself, which though nicely staged, feels a little rushed at times. Although a fistful of scenes give us the Japanese perspective they don't show would have been crucial moments of drama such as the belief that their single strike on the Yorktown gave way to believed rumours that two American carriers had been sunk, and the initial spotting of the American fleet by their pilots is not shown at all.That said the stakes of the climatic battle are well realised here and the CGI is NOT poor, nor distracting as others have claimed, it is extremely well done and is far more effective and real on the big screen. You forget your watching visual FX after a point, which one assumes, is the whole idea. Where the earlier Midway film failed in its visuals of the battle, here you're really put in the seat of the plunging dive bomber or on the deck of the carrier during the numerous actions. It is a visceral experience to see these sequences on the big screen and one that shouldn't be missed.Credit too must go to Casting Director ANDREA KENYON. It can't have been easy to get such a great ensemble of actors together for one picture (the scheduling must have been a nightmare) and the scale of the film certainly demands and receives a top quality line-up. Ed Skrein is appropriately cocky as pilot Dick Best, while Patrick Wilson adds appropriate gravitas as the intelligence officer whose warnings about an imminent Japanese attack were previously ignored. They're backed up by an engaging Woody Harrelson, Dennis Quaid and the criminally underused Mark Rolston, who are all excellent playing the senior officers, while the younger cast including Keean Johnson, Nick Jonas, Luke Kleintank and Daren Criss, all do well to make the most of their parts. Given their limited screen time, credit must also be given to the Japanese cast - It says a great deal that the scene where Rear Admiral Yamaguchi elects to go down with his ship is one of the most moving in the film and creates much sympathy for the Japanese navy who were against the war with the USA from the very beginning. (Their evil actions depicted elsewhere are not spared however ,with the execution of American POWs gruesomely depicted)Director Roland Emmerich, whilst having made some past turkeys, is an extremely competent film maker who can handle both scale, multiple characters and action sequences without them turning into an unwatchable 'what the hell is happening now' Micheal Bay snoozefest. We can tell what is happening to whom and there is always a sense of where things are taking place and why in relation to the story. Dialogue is functional to mediocre so while not a flawless film, I have no doubt that several scenes were cut to make sure the film hit a manageable running time. There is a huge thirst for well made historical epics set within this time peroid and a strongly urge both the film makers and the studio to release a longer version of the film on other formats, especially if it covers more aspects of the later battle. This will push what is already a good film to the next level."
"I've read several of the critical reviews of ""Midway""; they seem to reveal more about the cattiness of the reviewer than any understanding of the movie, or its message.
I am part of the growing legion of American moviegoers who have pretty much given up on Hollywierd having any clue how to convince me to actually care enough about any of their offerings to part with the price of admission. I can wait a few months till they show up free on Youtube to confirm my suspicions that I haven't wasted my money.
I made the rare exception this weekend to see ""Midway"", because I'm a history buff, and the previews I'd seen showed promise that the story would be properly told. That said, I went in with the full expectation that it might fail my already low expectations.
Happy to say that it far exceeded my best hopes. Roland Emmerich has put together a gripping storyline that manages to get in all the important elements of an epic story in 128 minutes. For the story of the American victory at Midway is an epic tale that every American should become familiar with.
Few Americans today can fathom what dire straits the US found itself in in 1942: Our battleships lay in twisted ruins on the bottom of Pearl Harbor; we had four aircraft carriers facing a Japanese navy with twelve, equipped with aircraft which were far superior to anything that was then available to American fliers; those aircraft were piloted by experienced men who had honed their craft in four years of war in China. We helplessly watched as thousands of American soldiers, sailors and Marines in the Pacific Islands and the Philippines were made captive, beyond the reach of our aid.
All the Japanese had to do was to concentrate on Midway, overwhelm our inferior naval and air forces, and Hawaii and the West Coast would be wholly at their mercy.
The essayist Matthew Arnold once said, ""Have something to say, and say it as clearly as you can. That is all anyone needs to know about style."" Emmerich follows his advice. No actors involved in ""Midway"" will be nominated for an Oscar. Which is another way of saying that there are no star turns which detract from telling the story. I will say that the actors are very believable in their roles; as the son of a Marine who fought in the Pacific, I found their portrayals pretty convincing.
I'm firmly of the opinion that CGI effects are overused to distract from thin or non-existent plotlines. I credit Emmerich for using them to reinforce an already strong narrative. To those critics who found them overpowering, I inquire: How in hell do you think the shock of modern warfare registered on the men who actually faced it at Pearl Harbor and Midway? They called it ""shell shock"" for a damned good reason."
I don't typically go to movies on the war but I am glad I went to Midway. Showed both sides (American/Japanese). All of the actors were terrific-especially Quaid and Layton!
"This remake of the original 1976 movie was much more historically correct. It was obvious that everyone involved researched and studied the history behind the greatest naval battle in history! Kudos to all the actors, directors and producers for making an entertaining and quality movie!"
"When I first saw the previews of this movie, I feared another ridiculous and distorted movie like the 2001 movie, Pearl Harbor. I was relieved it was not. It is amazing how many specific details of the early days of the Pacific War are crammed into this movie. So many that only those already familiar with the battles will be able to spot them all.Although I am a former Naval Aviator, kudos to the writers to giving the Marine Aviators and Army Air Corps their due credit in the battle of Midway, something the 1976 movie neglected. Only one minor disappointment in that the sacrifice of the three American Torpedo Bombing squadrons was underplayed.I suspect those not familiar with history will not be able to keep up with all the details portrayed, but outstanding job by Roland Emmerich for even trying.PS. To the dude below about the glaring historical accuracy, you are correct. Midway was reinforced with a detachment of B-26 bombers armed with torpedoes. One of the did make a suicide run at IJN Akagi, which prompted Admiral Nagumo to prepare for a second air attack on Midway Island, only to reverse his decision when one of his cruiser's scout plane's spotted one of the American task forces, all of which contributed to ordnance to be stacked all over the Akagi's hanger bay when LT Richard Best's single bomb detonated inside the Akagi, causing an inferno that doomed the ship."
"Really brackets the historical events prior to Midway well--especially from Enterprise's perspective. Nice inclusion of vignettes from the lead up, and battle itself. Some gloss over on the intel build up, but I expect that's due to runtime constraints.While this has the usual war film embellishments, I think it does well for tackling so much in the time it had--definitely worth a watch."
"The most impressive aspect of the film is the amazing cinematography and special effects (including sound) which surpass by a wide margin anything previously attained regarding era warships and naval aviation. You MUST see this in a Dolby equipped theater to get the full body rocking audio and visual experience. Don't settle for a normal theater.Without question, this is the best movie ever made about the crucial WW2 Battle of Midway which (closely following the American tactical defeat-strategic victory at the Battle of the Coral Sea) forever changed the course of the Pacific War. In fact it is the best movie about World War 2 naval and aviation warfare ever made in terms of visual and audio presentation and historical accuracy.As a serious albeit amateur historian, I can only offer kudos to the film's fidelity to the facts of the events as they unfolded. Yes, there is truncation of history necessary for translating these sorts of events to film. But the film's creators somehow manage to get right at least 80% of things involved in a very complicated sequence of battle events in a bit over two hours of action packed mind-blowing movie-magic.I was impressed by the film's steadfast adherence to the facts and actual events and its presentation of the tools of warfare. I might quibble with certain depictions of people and actions, but in the main they get it right. My fears that this might be another abortion like Disney's ""Pearl Harbor"" or star laden inaccurate version like the 1976 ""Midway"" were blown away by the fidelity of this effort. The special effects used to show the ships and planes in action are nothing short of marvelous. Bravo!The weakest aspect of the film are the handful of dramatic interludes of worried loved ones and troubled commanders and portrayals of some of the individuals involved, but even these are tolerable. I should also say that the film doesn't show as much gore as what really happens in combat so it doesn't have the accurate stomach turning scenes as present in ""Saving Private Ryan"". I didn't mind that.What drives this film are the action battle sequences showing the destructiveness of the tools of war at the time. They'll knock your socks off! The brief but breath-taking reenactment of the Pearl Harbor attack starts the film off on its roller coaster ride with sequences of ships and planes and people being blasted to smithereens from both the perspective of the fish in the barrel and the folks shooting at them. You see these events on both the micro and macro level. Thankfully, the movie doesn't treat the Japanese as mindless monkeys as so many World War 2 films do and it presents their dilemmas and derring-do quite fairly.The visual depiction of the planes, warships and weapons of the era appear to have been thoroughly researched and are presented more accurately, beautifully and forcefully than any other film about World War 2.But it's the action sequences that will have your eyes glued onto the screen and your ears begging for relief (in a good way) and thanking the folks from Dolby. I think many folks will enjoy this picture, especially history buffs.Don't believe the negative reviews from the professional reviewers. They're looking for auteur, drama, dialogue and art rather than history, audio-visual dynamism... and your own thrilling experience in the theater."
"I had high expectations for this movie, and they were absolutely MET and EXCEEDED.In my opinion, ""Midway"" is the best and most historically-accurate WWII movie of recent memory, and it's one of the few that actually highlights the air war in the Pacific. The writers seemed to recognize that simply recreating this momentous series of events was an amazing story in-and-of itself, without wasting time on unnecessary drama and distractions.You can tell that the writers, producers and actors all paid close attention to maintaining historical accuracy throughout the film. From Pearl Harbor to Midway, they captured many of the key interesting and critical moments along the way. They also showed both the American and Japanese perspectives in an insightful and respectful manner, which only adds to the complexity of the story.Also, the action scenes will have anyone (history lover or not!) on the edge of their seats the whole time! I loved every moment showing the SBD Dauntlesses and the processes of dive bombing, and I enjoyed their portrayal of the Doolittle raid.Finally, the casting was great. Each actor portrayed his or her real-life counterpart in a masterful and poignant way.In short, I can't recommend this movie enough. It's incredibly important to remember the courage, daring and skill of the men and women who fought in WWII, today and every day. This movie brings their sacrifices and skills to life."
Decided to watch this today and i was surprised at how well made this movie was. I was happy they didnt go the pearl harbor route and add a love story in there. It was told in a factual way and the the cinematography was amazing. How the critics messed this one up is beyond me maybe there not fans of the director but roland held back on the independence day humor and put a more serious mood into this movie and how critical this battle was and how it led up to this battle. Its worth the watch. He used factual accounts of individuals such as nimitz and halsey and picked out critical members of the battle who earned high honors during the battle. Roland did a great job directing this movie and did it with factual precision.
Far better than what I thought it would be. Tense War movie. I really enjoyed this movie which is based on true life events. Please don't think this movie is anything like the pearl harbour movie because it isn't.
"One of the few blockbuster war movies to give credit to the oft-maligned intelligence component of World War II, and yes I've read Layton's salty 1985 memoirs. If you like remarkably realistic battle scenes, this movie is for you. As an intelligence professional, I loved the scenes in ICPOA (Intelligence Center Pacific Ocean Area) although for the life of me I still don't completely understand the difference in Layton's role as Nimitz's intelligence chief and Joe Rochford's role as chief of Nimitz's intelligence center. I didn't know he wandered around in a bathrobe but I did know he got screwed by jealous Washington rivals and shipped off to command a drydock on the West Coast. Given that he and Layton were among the fifty (!!) Japanese linguists the Navy had, a shameful waste on many levels. And guess who replaced Rochford? One Commander Roscoe Hillenkoetter, surviving EXO of West Virginia who as naval attache in Paris in 1940 had watched the Germans march in to Paris. After the war, and a stint as captain of USS Missouri, he was appointed by Harry Truman as the first director of the CIA.This movie is like the world's greatest Trivial Pursuit for historians. look, there's CNO Admiral King giving Nimitz the bad news about his next assignment; look: John Ford with his signature round sunglasses madly filming the attack on Midway. Oh, no, that torpedo bounced off the hull of the Japanese warship: wait til the same thing happens at Midway and the torpedo squadron goes down in flames. And having seen MANY photos of Admiral Nimitz, a shout-out to Woody Harrelson, who looked and sounded just like a good ol' Texas boy."
This was a great flick fro beginning to end. Plane fight after plane fight. Great film. I don't understand the bad reviews I really dont. It was enjoyable and I certainly liked it.
"It was refreshing to see a bunch of new faces and few seasoned faces as well. The producers and directors did an awesome job of putting the effects together. Those of us who had parent who had experienced these events during their lifetime, I believe would think this movie was realistic.in the AMC theatre that we saw this is, it was the most attended that I have ever seen since the movie Titantic.Thank you for Shanghai Ruyi whom I supposed was a big help to Liongate. Chinese movie makes began in the 1900's and now with their excellent cinematographers and directors they are really competing with American film makers. I hope that my movie China Station can get the same kind of talent that was on this movie! Blessings to cast, crew and producers."
"Midway was an excellent movie that depicts the events leading up to the battle of Midway and the battle itself.
It is fairly quick paced with enough historical background character introductions to leave the viewer invested, even if we already know the outcome. The family and buddy scenes are not lengthy, and add just the right amount of the human element.
The movie covers the events from before Pearl Harbor, the attack on pearl Harbor, the US raid on the Marianas islands, Doolittle's raid, the battle of Coral Sea, the battle of Midway and the intelligence, strategy, of both the US and IJN navies. Though none of the events is overly detailed it is enough for the average historian to see all the ""easter eggs"" and the non-historian left informed and intrested.
While the movie covers a lot of historical ground it doesn't get overly detailed on each event, even the Midway battle itself. What it does do is provides the viewer the overall tension, concerns and apprehensions of the mood of he US durring this time in history.
Midway does leave out certain historical events. It didn't cover the PBYs search, the B-17 raids on the IJN carriers, it didn't include Jimmy Thatch, or the two attacks on the Yorktown in detail.
But, and I must stress this fact, what it did cover was accurate (with the exception of the US torpedo planes carrying bombs on wing hard mounts).
For the first time in a movie it covers the air raids on the IJN carriers from Midway itself, including thr B-26 Marauders, but not the TBF avengers. It included the Nautilus Gato class firing on the IJN taskforce and the reason the Japanese left behind the destroyer which was later followed by the US SBDs that led them to the IJN carries.
The CGI was adequate for visual effects, and the detail of the Yorktown class carriers and even the IJN carriers was incredibly accurate.
Midway focuses on several key individuals to be the protagonist rather than a PBS style docudrama.
Midway also pays attention to detail about the age of the sailors, the types of aircraft, and weaponry aboard ships.
Midway does feel like it needs the director's cut and would do better as a three hour movie as it felt a little rushed at times.
Bottom line, if you're into WWII and history you'll like this move, it's a go see."
"I just had an unstoppable urge to register and leave my rate. After watching Joker I left cinema speechless, astonished, angry and demotivated how pathetic the movie was. After Midway, I left the movie theather inspired, happy and curious to read more detail about the battle the very same day. Best wishes to American soldiers and veterans! Cheers from Poland."
"The movie was well done. The actors were engaging, the stories leading up to the battle were interesting and that battle itself was exciting to watch. Watch the original Midway. That had big stars but it was lazy filmmaking. That movie took scenes from Tora Tora Tora for the attack on Midway. The movie was enjoyable and a testament to those men who gave their lives to turn the tide during WW2."
"The events of December 7th 1941 left an indelible mark on the psyche of America and became a date that truly has lived in infamy. Though historians, authors, and filmmakers have attempted to analyze the events during and leading to the attack on Pearl Harbor; there is still a great deal of interest about the attack and the aftermath.While Pearl Harbor was for many the opening shots of the U.S. entry into World War II; some would say that the stage was set earlier when the United States attempted to curtail what they saw as an aggressive and Imperialistic Japan by placing restrictions on their vital resources such as oil and the tonnage of their Navy.In the new film ""Midway"" we are given a glimpse into this when four years before the attack, when Edwin Layton (Patrick Wilson) meets with Admiral Nagumo (Jun Kunimura) who lets him know that hardline factions in his government have been buoyed by their invasion of China and will do what is needed to make sure the vital oil that is supplied by the U.S. remains constant.
Flash forward to the day of the attack and Layton who has warned that an attack was possible at Pearl Harbor is seeing his worst predictions come true. In the aftermath he is assigned to Admiral Nimitz (Woody Harrelson); who has been given the thankless task of taking charge of what is left of the Pacific Fleet and finding a way to stop the Japanese fleet.The U.S. finds themselves outnumbered, outgunned, and waging war with ships and planes that are inferior to the Japanese but they must find a way to overcome the great obstacles before them and defeat a relentless enemy.
Layton and a team of code breakers are convinced the Japanese intend to attack the island of Midway and go all in to set a trap with the goal of destroying the enemy carriers so the U.S. can gain an aerial advantage in the Pacific.With a strong cast which features Luke Evans, Dennis Quaid, Mandy Moore, Aaron Eckhart, Nick Jonas and a fine supporting cast, Director Roland Emmerich has given audiences a gripping war movie that despite the impressive visual effects; never loses site of the fact that this is a story of real people who found themselves in pivotal moments of history.The film also shows how the Japanese commanders had differing views of the Americans they fought. Some considered them to lack braveness while others admired their tenacity and were grateful that they had what they saw as inferior and outdated planes to attack them in.The film also does a great job showing the Doolittle Raid and how what from a military standpoint caused minor damage yet was a huge psychological boost as Japan believed they were immune from attack yet the American forces found a way to bomb Tokyo by the impossible task of using land based bombers off a carrier.The film is a great mix of human drama that shows not only the terrible toll of war but how a group of extraordinary individuals gave their all.4.5 stars out of 5"
"Finally there is a WW2 movie with the right balance of modern effects and good storytelling. I've always preferred the straightforward stories in Tora Tora Tora and A Bridge Too Far over the newer gory angst filled war movies and those which deal with obscure insignificant incidents. Unlike Bay's Pearl Harbor or the older Midway movie there is no wasted time on silly romances. Also the dragginess of Eastwood and the gore of Spielberg are not present here.The screenplay is clear and comprehensive from pre Pearl Harbor to the decisive day everything is clearly explained. Doolittle deserves mention. Good history lesson for some folks nowadays who seem to forget which country was defending themselves against those who waged aggressive wars! Slower moments are not dull as they are used to explain strategy, training and the role of intelligence.The air battle scenes and dive bombing scenes are thrilling yet clear. You can still see who is who. You are really put right into the center of things. Superb exciting cinematography without looking fake or too CGI.The casting is brilliant. Using distinctive famous actors to portray the various heroes helps the viewer remember who is who and build up sympathy for whether they make it or not. Ed Skrein usually the anti hero type role. Here he plays the cocky pilot and his eventual vulnerability is touching. Luke Evans is convincing as another hero pilot. Patrick Wilson is perfect as the intelligence officer who helped get it right. The older actors like Denis Quaid and Aaron Eckhart are well cast too and Woody usually a goofball is fine. Actors usually don't associate with historic roles like Darren Criss and Jonas are surprisingly right. Mandy Moore looks pretty and suitable in her WW2 getup. Should do more roles from this period. The Japanese naval officers are distinctive enough to differentiate.A truly international effort it took a German director, Chinese producers, an American writer and great British and American cast to make the best WW2 movie in decades."
Great movie! Watched it on Veterans' Day. I am so thankful for the men who fought for freedom. This movie is a tribute to them and our great country. It also emphasized America's focus after Pearl Harbor to show the strength of the Navy despite devastation.
"Not Pear Harbor, which is very refreshing. Very close to accurate which is awesome!"
"Rating 4.0/10
I had high hopes for ""midway"" war between America and Japan, unfortunetly this movie goes to war of the bored. With the epic status that this movie was advertised with, it was a supreme disappointment. You will willingly sit through this movie but when it's over you'll feel like you wasted two hours. The action and special effect was okay. But the movie is somewhat claustrophobic. The acting was okay even if at times the script seemed daunted. In the end, If i had to describe midway in one word it would be disappointing."
"Please just go and see, don't be fooled at 6.8."
"It's at least a 8.5-9...
And I'm not even really into war movies.
Midway was straight to the point. Never dull and quite intense.
Not to much character development or romantic crap, which worked out nicely.
Good acting.
Very pleased to see in theaters!"
"Midway is not really a remake, but a telling of the story from the eyes of the men on the Enterprise during the critical early days of World War II. It doesn't try to cover everything.
Whether it's Slim Townsend wrestling a wayward torpedo on the deck or Bruno Guido dueling a Betty, the events depicted really happened. Not to burst  bubble, but McCluskey did drop a bomb. Max Leslie oFGf the Yorktown squadron was the squadron leader who lost his bomb.
It's the first movie at Midway that correctly depicted the warships as they appeared in the war and not a tacky new carrier fill in for example. I feel it was well researched, accurate and the action kept me on the edge of my seat. A great movie."
A bit Hollywood but a good movie. Much better than the embarrassment of the movie Pearl Harbor.
"First, the cast was great, especially Woody Harrelson as Chester Nimitz. The Battle scenes and the movie itself, were far superior to the 76 version, and they left out the lame love story. The two biggest errors were: Wade McCluskey loses his bomb due to an electrical arming error in his dauntless (he was also a dauntless pilot, but they did Hollywood it up a bit), and they never once showed an American fighter, which is a glaring omission. The F4F Wildcat was the fleet fighter at the time. Both it and the horrible Brewster Buffalo (flying from Midway) should have been present. The torpedo hitting a Japanese ship and failing was totally true, in fact, one broke up and floated, enabling Japanese sailors to use it to be rescued. This was thanks to the penny pinching of the US government before the war. Some authors I'll suggest are, Prange, Lord and Symonds if anyone wants to know more."
I LOVED this movie. Kept me on the edge of my seat from the first moment.
"Seeing the trailers and early critics reviews, I expected a movie similar the 2001 Pearl Harbor- a film dominated by the sappy ""love triangle"".
""Midway"" while not perfect, did not fall into the same trap. Overall, the film focuses on the battles from the attack on Pearl Harbor through Midway.The best parts of the movie are the battle scenes, which in the end save the movie. The special effects are very good, although some are over the top, like the laser-like machine gun fire and powerful some over the top explosions.The film would have been better without the omnipresent loud background music that over powered the dialog. The acting was decent, but the scenes switched rapidly from one to the next, so few individual scenes lasted more than a couple of minutes. This lead to little character development. War movie cliches in the dialog were frequent.The film would have been better had it focused solely on the Battle of Midway- the intelligence effort to discover the Japanese attack plans, the preparations for the defense of Midway, the deployment of the U.S. naval forces, the actual battle.In the end it was decent entertainment; saved by the battle scenes. Not a war movie at the level of quality as ""Dunkirk"", but not as disappointing as ""Pearl Harbor""."
As a military history buff I loved the movie. Very realistic to me. It showed real people making history. My father and my three uncles served in World War 2 and what sacrifice it took to keep us free.
"My husband and I are both retired Navy, this brilliant film brought to light the story of the battle of Midway Island, and a little of the Pearl Harbor attack. This film was perfectly cast, amazing screenplay, special effects are OSCAR worthy completely..
Looking forward to purchasing the DVD.."
"Absolutely awesome, griping and fist pounding. You know the answers, but this is the truth.."
"If you're a Veteran, this will make you proud. If you're not, then you're probably comparing this to Star Wars or The Avengers. This is a good movie meant to give you an understanding of what it meant to be an American Sailor/Pilot back when anything state-of-the-art was coming out of Japan."
A movie that portrayed the real war and behind the Midway Battle!
"The story line is clear and concise, the three threads are in line. The history is reproduced. The decisive battle at Midway is the turning point of the Pacific battlefield... the visual effects of air combat and dive bombing are super and shocking! American and Japanese military personnel are both professional and courageous, though serving opposite purposes.Epic level! On the Veterans Day, just an additional way to pay tribute to our US soldiers!"
"Out of all the battles of World War II that have been portrayed on the big - and small - screen, the Battle of Midway has been the among the most difficult to adapt. The battle itself consisted of a complex series of events spread out over hundreds of miles of ocean and spanning a period of several days. There are the technical challenges of depicting naval and aerial combat. And there was also a considerable amount of prologue leading up to the Battle of Midway involving episodes occurring around the Asia-Pacific theater.Any attempt to depict the Battle of Midway in a film setting is therefore going to face all of these challenges, and more. But all in all, Director Roland Emmerich does a fair job in balancing the history with dramatic interpretation.
The strongest parts of this film were the battle sequences, particularly those involving the actual battle of Midway. It's interesting that Emmerich chose to focus more specifically on the USS Enterprise and particularly on the dive bombers of ""Bombing 6,"" and I think that this approach actually worked well. Unlike the 1976 version, some of the actual pilots of Bombing 6 (particularly Richard ""Dick"" Best and Wade McClusky) are portrayed extensively - and for the most part sensitively - in this version.The Japanese perspective is also largely portrayed respectfully in this film. One particularly moving scene involved the scuttling of the Hiryu and Rear Admiral Yamaguchi's decision to go down with his flagship.All of this being said, this version of the Midway Battle suffers from a number of issues. In particular, the movie drags at the beginning and then feels rushed at the end. I'm not sure if this movie really needed to depict Pearl Harbor, the Marshall Islands raid, and the Doolittle Raid in the detail that it did. And some of the actual Battle scenes felt rushed, with important details omitted (e.g. the contributions of the PBY Catalina search planes, which get a lot more mention in the 1976 version than this one).Generally speaking, the acting in this movie was good, although you can tell the actors who were really settling into their characters from the ones ""phoning it in.""In terms of historical accuracy, I did not detect any glaring errors or omissions. I could tell that certain episodes received special mention (perhaps due to the producers involved in this film). The Marshall Islands are not ""high"" islands like Tahiti or Hawai'i but low lying coral atolls like Midway. And as mentioned previously, certain scenes from the actual Battle of Midway were omitted or felt rushed.
But overall, I enjoyed this film version of the Battle of Midway. To some degree, this version is more historically accurate than the 1976 version. There was quite a bit of CGI, but that's to be expected from a war film covering such an epic battle (and CGI is better than recycled war movie footage). And thankfully, this is not the ""sequel"" to Pearl Harbor that I was afraid this movie would be. If anything, this is the way they should've made Pearl Harbor, with all the romantic triangle story baloney minimized or thrown out.
A Solid 8/10 (especially for the actual battle scenes)"
"Knowing the story behind some of the more familiar names, like Nimitz and Halsey, itxwas great to see the stories behind other men intimately involved in the greatest Naval battle. A reminder on this Veterans day weekend what heroism and sacrifice means. The CGI was good and brought the battle to life."
This is one heck of a story. The brave men that fought that battle-wow. It was actually better than I thought it was going to be. Thank you to all the veterans who sacrificed their lives for our freedom. It was very understandable and the timeline and explanations were a very good part. The flying of the planes and the CGI was terrific. Amazing overall movie.
"Amazing cinematography and casting. Midway is a must see.
How often do you see a movie that ends in audience applause and truly deserves it?"
Don't like this movie. Unbelievable action packed movie with spectacular amazing battles. Great cast though Skreins nasal voice is distracting. Ignore any detractors who say the movie doesn't honor the men who fought in this battle. How could it not when they're mostly shown to be unbelievably brave. What pathetic losers. If there's some embellishment or inaccuracies who cares. All real life movies have that. Sissy critics didn't like this but loved Dunkirk where you couldn't name one single character or care about them. That was one full movie. This is hands down one of the best WWII movies ever made. My wife loved it even more than me. Must see.
I was genuinely amazed at how well done this was. Visually stunning. Excellently acted. It covered so many nuances and really brought home the hazards faced by the men who fought in WW2. Interactions on the home front with wives and children were also wonderfully portrayed. These men were heroes and the movie captured that. The only possible complaint is that it covered so much material it could easily have benefitted from being longer.
"Excellent movie, I was thoroughly entertained from start to finish. Highly recommend anyone watch this as soon as possible"
"This is a good movie and historically accurate. I would have preferred more Midway battle lead up but that would likely drag the movie down. Knowing what I know I would have added about 5 minutes of movie to clarify a few things: the significance of Nautilus, who they guy in the ocean is after he is shot down, etc. The movie flowed and used backstories to tie the action together. The millennial critics don't like the movie because it shows the realities of war and how a few people made a difference. In other words - America is a good place. These critics hate America and ignore the truth so they nitpick and complain about too many characters and the language of the period. This is a good movie."
"Not much drama and love story to tell, this movie focuses on the big picture of the war. Pretty tight and powerful. The special effect is also impressive.Not made for the audiences who would only enjoy little story centering on one or two characters. This is a history movie for history fans.It is a pity that the story on Japanese attack on Yorktown is missing. Would've made the battle more intense and interacting."
"Intelligence officer Edwin Layton (Patrick Wilson) warns that a Japanese attack is imminent, but his advice is disregarded and the Japanese use their carrier fleet to attack Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941. Admiral Chester Nimitz (Woody Harrelson) swiftly assumes command of the heavily weakened US Pacific Fleet. After the Doolittle air raid on Tokyo & Honshu 4.5 months later, events lead up to the Battle of Midway on June 4-7, 1942. Ed Skrein plays cocky pilot Dick Best while Dennis Quaid is on hand as carrier commander William ""Bull"" Halsey.""Midway"" (2019) tackles the Battle of Midway and events leading up to it without throwing in a dramatic fictional story, like the love triangle of ""Pearl Harbor"" (2001). While I loved ""Pearl Harbor"" and proudly stand by it, ""Midway"" chooses to stick to the facts and is thrilling from beginning to end. The main cast members are all real-life figures and there's a tribute to each at the close.This is superior to the 1976 movie because Roland Emmerich had the CGI technology to pull off the battle scenes which take place in & above the Pacific Ocean near the atoll of Midway, which is located a little over a thousand miles west of Hawaii. The flick successfully takes the viewer right into the midst of the fight on the water, in the air and under the water. It's exciting, horrific and revelatory.The film runs almost 2 hours and 18 minutes.GRADE: A-"
"Midway, a very accurate depiction of the battle that turned the tide in the Pacific in the first year of the United States involvement in WW2, stirs the soul in illustrating the sacrifices of thousands of young Americans turning the powerful Japanese tide.
Ignore all those who say the CGI were amateurish. Pushing technology to its limits, the special effect experts working on the movie convincingly portrayed how close to realistic the historic series of events appeared. Short of getting antique WW2 planes and naval carriers, with would be impossible today, the magic of computer-generated images made this film drench in heroics virtually unmatched in aviation history.
The science fiction films of Star Wars, et al, cannot come close to the real life experiences of these brave airmen. Midway should be required viewing to all high schoolers who either fail to appreciate the ultimate sacrifices these brave naval and air men took after Pearl Harbor, or are ignorant through the failings of today's education to understand what it took for all of us to have the freedoms we enjoy today. Midway, the movie, serves as a rewarding memoir to those men."
"The film covered quite a lot of history in a couple of hours. Not cliched. Lots of death but a minimum of gore. Other reviewers will give a more detailed look. Congrats to the writing/directing team as both American and Japanese are honored and respected. And a nod to the Chinese money guys whose country suffered greatly under Japanese control. One stat stood out, though. Is it true that 250,000 Chinese were killed for helping Doolittle and his men get to safety after the Tokyo raid."
Just saw this today. All I can say is wow. Historically accurate. The battle scenes were some of the best I've seen in a movie. Real American heroes. On this Veteran's Day I felt proud and honored that people like this existed and still exist.
"First, I'll agree that the filmmakers got a lot of details right: The timing of the U.S. attacks when the Japanese were caught in the rearming process. The poor performance of the Devastator TBD. Faulty torpedoes. The politics of the Japanese military. The fast turn-around getting Yorktown out to sea again. And lots more.But the errors, embellishments and omissions were glaring: The Marshal Islands attack was ridiculously inflated. The Kamikaze hit on Enterprise during that battle (complete with Nick Jonas saving the day) never took place. The complete absence of American fighter planes on the American carriers. American attackers going in and facing anti aircraft fire without having first been jumped by Zeroes, and the missing dogfights via F4F fighter escorts. SBDs blowing Zeros out of the sky. Taking the time to depict John Ford as a brave movie maker on Midway, yet not showing Marine Fighter Squadron 221, flying antiquated equipment, going out to meet the incoming Japanese attackers against overwhelming odds and pretty much getting slaughtered. Yorktown's involvement in the battle reduced to one scene where she is burning, depicted from afar. The Nautilus getting depth-charged U-571 style. The ships in both fleets in such tight formations, it's more like a photo op than a battle formation.So many worthwhile details that could have been made right in the same screening length, if they would have simply ditched the goofy Doolittle sequence. I love Aaron Eckhart, great actor, but his scenes in China had no place in a movie called ""Midway,"" if the price was cutting out major elements of the Midway battle.Maybe I'm being picky, but when they go out of their way to glorify John Ford, while leaving out a squadron of Marine fighter pilots that sacrificed themselves so valiantly, it just strikes me as typical Hollywood b.s."
"Yes, you could just write this off as a proper CGI-fest - BUT - it has been done with a very commendable eye to the detail. The flimsiness of the aircraft, and of the ships for that matter, are conveyed effectively. You do get a sense of the mortality of sailors from both sides and a little of the dignity of the proceedings too. Ed Skrein does come across as a bit of a gung-ho hero, but without the puerile ""Ye Ha!"" type of nonsense that we see more commonly now in almost every movie which centres around the achievements of the US military. Perhaps because it is based on real people and events, it is a more respectful tribute to their accomplishments. Needs a big screen - will look dreadfully man-made on telly."
"Pretty bad CGI and terrible acting from some actors including the main character. Sound effects are brilliant in the other hand.All in all not a good movie, but an interesting war-flick."
"I advise all of you to watch this film .... But unfortunately the green screen uses was clearly too much lots of cinematic unrealistic scenes
.
But i can say that i enjoyed it as a cinematic documentary movie
.
It explained what happened during the midway war in interesting scenario"
"As someone very knowledgeable about the subject, I was somewhat disappointed. Whether it was the wrinkled uniforms, the painful dialogue, the over-the-top dramatics and exaggerated explosions (hey, it's Emmerich!)... it was clear the film was not made for people like me who know the details and the characters very well.The rating depends greatly on the target audience. It's clear this film was made for a younger audience, and as such, it does a very good job of conveying the history quite accurately. It's a lot to take on with a 2:20 movie (complete with a 6-month summary of events leading up to the title battle) and it does a fine job of that.Correct history of this great nation tragically just isn't taught anymore, so I heartily applaud any effort to do so. I just wonder if younger audiences have any desire to learn it. So if I'm rating from that perspective, it jumps up a few points.I just wish a little more care with the details and script had been taken to leave the older audience satisfied from our knowledge level."
"Just like the critics got The Joker wrong they also missed the boat on this one! Very fast paced, moving, and exciting. I found myself immersed in this historical drama. This movie made me proud of my Naval vet status and my Grandfathers naval service in WW2. Outstanding!"
I don't believe the reviews I'm seeing. Cookie-cutter war movie? Dialogue isn't engaging? Go back to starbucks and get your 10 hours of sleep before film class. This movie is historically accurate and brought some of the actual veterans to tears. Casting was great. Was pleasantly surprised by Nick Jonas's performance. And the action scenes kept me on the edge of my seat. It's not out to win awards. They're trying to tell a story and do the veterans and the battle itself justice which i think they did wonderfully. Not much lovey dubby content.
A war movie based on historical events. The fact that they tied in the attack on Pearl Harbor and the Doolittle Raid leading up to the battle of Midway made this movie my top war movie based on history. Way to go!
"Don't pay attention to the people who rate this less than a 6, they must have some other issue because this movie was excellent. As far as Hollywood, sure it was Hollywoodish, but mainly just in the special effects. The expressions and 99% of the dialogue was well done in true to the time period. While the characters were Hollywood stars, the planet portrayed the actual people flawlessly.The story moves at a quick pace and they do a good job building many of the characters and assuming you have some intelligence to know with Admirals Nimitz and Halsey as well as Yamamoto and Genda on the Japanese side.Well worth the watch!!"
"Excellent movie in all respects! I can't remember the last time I heard applause at the end of a movie, but I did today."
"Just came back from the cinema and am still wowed by this film. It's a nice blend of quiet scenes where we get to know the characters and intense war scenes. Try not to get a high hartbeat when you're in the seat of a dive bomber, going down fast towards a Japanese carrier while being greeted by a hailstorm of bullets and grenades. The courage these pilotes had is beyond belief. I was on the edge of my seat. This is one of the best war movies to date and it has been kept true to the real story and people. I was afraid it would go the route of Pearl Harbour but luckily they stayed away from cheesy scenes."
"First I'd like to start out saying I am the type of person that can spend all day in a WW2 museum and feel like I need to go back the next day, so my review is from someone who knew almost everything about the Battle of Midway going in.Midway is an authentic and historically accurate WW2 movie that opted to follow characters based on real life sailors and aviators instead of creating fictional ones. The movie gets off to a good start before dragging in the middle. There are a few too many characters and it jumps around a lot for the casual viewer to keep up with but history buffs like myself won't have as difficult of a time with it.However, once we get to the actual Battle of Midway the movie really picks up and is a thrill the rest of the way. The action sequences are very well done and the heroism of both sides is adequately depicted without going over the top.Overall, I would say this is a must see in theaters for someone that has a passion for history. For the more casual viewer it is an entertaining movie with some flaws regarding pacing and a few too many characters to keep up with. Because of the attention to detail and respect for history I'm giving this movie a 9/10. I will absolutely be watching this again in the near future."
"My wife and I went to to see this picture last night and immediately upon leaving were perplexed at the low rating this had received. Enjoyed from start to finish. Good pace no yawning great drama, developed the characters and felt I learned more of the pacific conflict of the Second World War. We were both amused at our cinema with 8 theatres in using a regular sized one as opposed to the two giant seated ones. I asked an attendant about this and they said they should be moving Midway into the larger seated Theater as the crowds are bigger than they thought. This might be because of the Remembrance Day weekend and many people are paying tribute to our veterans. Upon arriving at home after the movie I googled all of the characters to learn more about them. Great flick would highly recommend seeing this movie."
"This is NOT a remake of the 1976 Midway, but is a fresh take on the people who really were instrumental in the success of the US Pacific Fleet following Pearl Harbor. Where the first film focused on the strategic side; The planning and mental chess game played by military leaders -- this one is geared more towards the people who actually carried out the plans and engaged the enemy. It is more of an action piece than a cerebral 'behind the scenes' what-really-happened film.First the Good: Acting was great, though nothing Oscar-worthy. The effects were fantastic as to be expected. It stayed fairly true to the actual history of what really transpired as told by the survivors. Well-paced, nothing too dragged out, but not too rushed either.The Bad: The writers obviously tried to use the language that people from that era would really use, but it doesn't equate well to today. The result is that some of the dialogue comes across as cheesy.I would have liked to see more of the actual processes the Navy took to locate the Japanese fleet and a little more on how they came to the conclusions they came too when making strategic decisions. But I cannot fault the film for being made to pander to the highest denominator.All in all in was an enjoyable movie to watch and I have the greatest respect for the real people that sacrificed so much to get America the victory in the Pacific."
"I hated that this movie was so cheesy! They took a great battle victory and made it about special effects. The story was over shadowed by the director's need to make the movie all about the visual effects and cocky attitudes. Every American knows that our fighting men are brave and stead fast in their duties. We did not need to see this farce, and they should have just told the store. I had to go home and watch the 1976 Midway movie to get this one out of my head."
"Jeez all the critics, just enjoy the effects, go easy on the cheesy diaogue
Everyones too critical these days!"
"While impressed with some of the CGI visuals, the overall storytelling of this event in history just felt too Hollywood. The scope of what laid before them and the true bravery of the men who fought that day seemed lost in all the visuals.
The importance of how the intelligence gathering before the fighting was handled initially, then eventually was also poorly presented. They are some excellent documentaries on Midway, suggest you track them down.."
"I'm just coming from the cinema, Midway is a worth to see movie, but the filmmakers used a bit too much CGI, sometimes you feel like watching a Medal of Honor game trailer."
"Nothing over the top like Hollywood can be. Genuine, real, and fascinating if you like anything about history."
I honestly expected this movie to be like Pearl Harbor and be full of inaccurate history and unnecessary characters and stories. I enjoyed every moment of the movie and didn't find myself lost or bored at all. The history in the movie is for the most part very accurate as well. This is one I am glad I went and watched and will buy the Blu-ray when it comes out.
"I had a feeling that this movie wouldn't disappoint me. And it was much better than I anticipated! It's straight forward, gets to the point without wasting time on any insignificant side-plots.
Instead it shows us the attack on Pearl, which I thought would be just a very quick introduction, and then the Doolittle and Marshall Islands raids before the actual battle of Midway. I couldn't ask for more action after all this.
Although the VFX of M.Bay's Pearl Harbor have aged well, this movie still gave us jaw-dropping battle scenes that feel huge, with a fair amount of screen time for the Japanese side. The Japanese fleet was gorgeous and I loved every shot of their ships.
'Midway' earned a place in my top favourite WW2 movies, along 'My Way', 'Cross of Iron', 'Thin Red Line' and 'Battle of Britain'."
"Abundant, not-quite-realistic computer-generated images make Midway look more like a video game than a depiction of real-life events. The overuse of subpar effects is the most dominant - but hardly the only - problem dogging this film. Epic war stories are difficult to tell without focusing on a few characters. This film unsuccessfully juggles too many plot threads and too many characters to keep an emotional anchor to the simulated events unfolding. Woody Harrelson is outstanding, but other cast members cannot overcome the limitations of the material and the challenges of acting on computer-generated sets."
"Thank GOODNESS for a movie that simply tells an historic story, and tells it well. No lousy love story. No needless drama. It's just straightforward story telling as a movie such as this should be."
This was an excellent retelling of incredible heroics.
"So my boys (9) liked it... especially the action sequences. I on the other hand didn't. Some good stars but all lacking any sense of believable performance, with a script that lacked narrative, coherence or direction just lots of cliches and other words. Given the Historic event and the heroism associated with it, just how Emmerich managed to produce something so uninspiring and lifeless is beyond me. The back and forth between the front and the home is laughable. Cardboard cut out Japanese characters and superficial un-engaging American heroes were boring, the action sequences overblown and exaggerated up-to and including planes flying through wave tips and the wreckage of other planes only to emerge unscathed, combined to stretch credibility to beyond breaking point. 2hrs and 18 mins of my life that I will never get back."
Overdone special effects. The story was historically accurate but the plot was pretty boring. Maybe they tried to cover too much time in one movie. The 1976 Midway was much better
"If you want to see good war movies, watch 1977 ""A Bridge Too Far"" and 1969 ""Battle of Britain."" By contrast, this movie is simply rubbish. Also poor choice of writer and director.""A Bridge Too Far"" had way better explanation of the overall situation through skillful use of exposition within the first half hour, and they did it with very good acting and dialogues that expertly differentiated all the major players. ""Midway"" by comparison is like having a kindergartner write the script and a manic preteen direct the movie.The aerial combat scenes in ""Battle of Britain"" are probably the best ever done on screen. And they did not have any CGI. The big air battle towards the end of that movie had more tension and realism that put all the fake and unrealistic plane scenes in ""Midway"" to cartoonish shame. Heck, even the ensemble cast of pilots in BoB were more interesting and memorable.Both ""A Bridge Too Far"" and ""Battle of Britain"" cost about the same as ""Midway"" in today's dollars. Both also had an ensemble cast of well-known and very good actors. Sadly, ""Midway"" seems to have wasted all of its money on really bad-looking CGIs and also failed to have the same quality of actors as in 1969 or 1977. Probably all the good actors read the script and immediately saw how dumb it was.A quick note about how this 2019 version compares with the 1976 movie: Both are equally bad. A few examples: A complete disregard for the order of battle, which was of critical importance in the actual battle. The several air attacks from Midway Island were never shown. This is a deep disrespect for the men who died in these crucial assaults that made possible the final outcome. Also, the older version used historically inaccurate footage, while the newer version had inexcusable inaccurate CGI version of aircraft and ordnance.If you enjoy history and in particular WW2 history, then skip this dumb movie."
"Sorry to disappoint all those who felt this was a great movie, but it doesn't compare either dramatically or historically accurate as the 1976 movie version of the same battle. It seems to be only a version stemming from a book written by the lead code-breaker in an attempt to beat his own drum ... Attempts to decry its better than Pearly Harbor is lost due to the horrible movie PH was ... It places its main heroics on the Edwin Layton (intelligence) and Dick Best (bomber pilot) instead of the more historically accurate focus on John Waldron (squad commander not portrayed in the movie) who's instincts actually led to the discovery of the Japanese fleet ... The portrayal of pilot Wade McClusky correctly showed his discovery of a solo Japanese destroyer which he followed to eventually catch up with the fleet ... The movie also did a terrible job of setting up the strategic battle plans both from the American and the Japanese points of view ... It failed to emphasize two major elements of the battle - 1) After Pearl Harbor, the Japanese thought it had damaged all the US carriers, 2) Admiral Nagumo's hesitating twice when preparing his carrier's planes first to be configured for an air attack, then changing for a land attack, only to change back for the air - which lost all time to counterattack the US - which destroyed not only his carrier but the majority of the Japanese fleet ... Lastly, while including Doolittle's Raiders, it did an inadequate job of reflecting on their heroics of bombing Tokyo knowing they didn't have enough fuel to return to any carrier or American base but left to crash into the ocean hoping to be picked up ... While this was not definitively part of the battle of Midway it contributed to the Japanese defensives and air support being incapable of proving what it needed for Midway."
"This atrocious movie was nothing but CGI.
Anyone who was unaware of the events of the title battle and Pearl Harbor would have no more idea of what actually happened after seeing the film than he or she had before watching it. Almost every important step was either glossed over or not included at all. The pathetic script focused instead on a few main characters, their individual combat action, and almost nothing else. What an insult this movie is to the brave sailors and avaiators who fought and won this pivotal battle, which is the single most important one in the entire history of the U. S. Navy. Some have compared it favorably to the 1976 film with Fonda, Ford, Heston, Holbrook, Mitchum, et al; that is beyond absurd. I gave it two stars only because the cgi was pretty good, but the way they chose to tell the story would require negative stars to rate fairly. Blech!"
"I'm not sure what others believe constitute a good movie but this is far from it. The opening credits highlighted the Chinese producers/influences of this film and makes sense as the movie trudges along. The overall story-telling and lineage of the movie are very disjointed and fractured. It feels like they were trying to recreate the magic of Dunkirk but didn't have a clue how to implement that strategy. There are also scenes that have no place in the movie or add zero value,if anything they create more confusion as to what this movie is really about.
Moving on from the choppy story-telling, the character's are super one-dimensional and are in now way representative of members in the military. The lead character is your basic cowboy/maverick embodied in how others may view us or our military members. The only thing that saves the horrible character development is Woody Harrelson's portrayal of Nimitz.
One shining light in this whole mess of a film is the action scenes. If there is one thing they got right, it was this. We like our intense explosions and in-your-face camera shots as they zoom across the screen but this is even watered down by the cheap feel of the CGI.
See at your own risk and be sure to know the history of the Pacific campaign in WWII before seeing this movie!"
"This movie is like Pearl Harbor (the Affleck/Hartnett one) but with a lot less corniness and glamor, and a tighter focus on the challenges faced by the armed forces in the Pacific in the aftermath of December 7. The battle scenes are more gripping than any I've ever seen in the big screen. A few times I found myself wringing my hands so hard that they hurt. This is a very straightforward war movie - one that illustrates the sacrifice of war veterans like few others."
Occasionally the critics get it wrong. I've seen the original Midway several times and this version focuses on different aspects of the same story. I found it very enjoyable and the actors/actresses did a fine job.
"This is what Pearl Harbor should have been like. Straight up war movie telling the events. I know they had to put fictional filler events in there for story purposes, but the war isn't a backdrop to a love story."
Such a great movie!! Super informative! Will wait for the next one!
"This movie had my heart pounding and my eyes tearing during those air raid scenes. The fight scenes with dive bombers were so intense and realistic compared to all the other ""same old same old robot alien comic book battles.""
Real people, Real lives, Real story. Go see it!! You wont be disappointed in watching Real humble brave everyday guys do the impossible"
"This movie kept my attention from start to finish. I especially thought Patrick Wilson was brilliant as LCDR Layton, lead intelligence officer for Admiral Nimitz who accurately assessed the Japanese fleet's intent to take the Midway Islands. Most people today don't understand what a pivotal battle this was in the Pacific Theater because had the US lost at Midway, the Japanese would have controlled the Pacific for 10 years or more, and would've completely changed the complexion of WWII. Only a little too much CGI kept me from awarding a perfect 10. Grade: A-."
"The critics are right in that the movie is a little shallow in terms of plot and character development ... but the need to fill in the story of events leading to Midway in order to educate a 21st audience meant there is too little screen time to accomplish address those deficiencies. The end result is still a rousing drama despite knowing the forgone conclusions. The only things that detracted me were the little jabs against the Japanese demanded by the Chinese producers of the movie, so transparently added to the story line to further the real grievances the Chinese people still have against Japanese aggression. But really, the war is long over and those guilty of atrocities are long dead or surely will be."
"I think an interesting aspect of this historical event (Midway) is how we (US) were the underdogs, not only because of the losses at Pearl Harbor, but because the war machine wasn't in great shape. It's just one small part of the War and one perspective (a Hollywood one), but it does do the job of letting viewers feel more and reflect more on those events, and pause to consider great men and how fortunate our country is. I remember watching the old version as a child and feeling awe. This new version left me with that feeling and more, green screen action and misplaced cinematic music notwithstanding."
"This movie has some of the best cinematography, and visuals ever made wo question, the angles are fantastic. I'm actually surprised the America haters in Hollywood made this, this should win big time awards but it wont because it does not meet the social justice qualifications it actually has men that are men and act like it. Go see it and support this flick it's very good."
"Very good movie,by telling the history of naval battles since pearl harbor until midway
And I think the acting roll for woody herrelson is excellent when I watch the movie I has get feeling that he is an excatlly admiral Chester Nimitz, and of course I can speak how wonderful roll for Patrick Wilson and Dennis quaid"
"Not familiar with the details or the art of war used in the battle of Midway but I will definitely be checking it out after watching this film. After watching this film I can't even imagine how all those people felt in the midst of such a battle. Seems like something terrifying and that feeling of watching those men in battle is what makes me think it is a good war film. It seems to go into detail regarding the occurrences of the battle and the ones that lead to it with almost all of the main characters having really existed (unlike the character of Ben Affleck in Pear Harbour for example).
On the other hand, the dialogue at some point seems a little cartoonish with characters saying or even behaving like what I would see in a cartoon or anime. It's normal that in cinema you often see people not behaving or talking like you see in real life but the film seemed to exaggerate at times.
The CGI are sufficient to transmit the feeling but not nearly enough for a film with a battle of this scale and historical importance lol. At times it seemed like the characters were looking at a screen with a movie playing (especially during the Pearl Harbour bombing scene).
But all in all, I recommend it for people who like war and/or historical movies."
"Midway has starpower and an absurd amount of naval and aerial combat. Unless you absolutely love planes, WWII, Nick Jonas, or battleships, this is just going to be an okay film."
"Midway is an historically accurate, intense, and exciting portrayal of one of the most important battles of WWII. They do a nice job of giving the back story so those not familiar with the history can understand the battle in its historical context. The plot is fast paced and at times riveting. It was a pleasure to sit through a movie of over two hours that kept your attention the whole time and didn't lag. No looking at your watch in this one.While there is some Hollywood bending of the facts, overall the movie is very historically accurate, much more so than many war movies, and close enough to the truth that people with no knowledge of the battle will leave with a pretty good understanding of what actually transpired. The CG is very good, perhaps overdone in places but that is the nature of movies today. The ships and planes are quite accurate and only the rivet counters among us will quibble over the inaccuracies; none of which detract from the story.I'm not a Woody Harrelson fan, but he does a really nice job in this movie as does Dennis Quaid.Good flick. Two thumbs up, worth seeing."
"This movie is really good, but I need more drama. Here you can see a lot of action only. Thats why 7."
"Bottom line: if you like historical dramas, you are likely to like this film. If you don't, avoid and save yourself several hours.Spoilers are minor (if you know your history).For intents and purposes, this film does do justice (for the most part) of the account of the Battle of Midway. This is a very fast paced film with little character development. In this case, it really does not need it as the director concentrated on McClusky and Best. This fine but in many ways it may not be needed. Harrelson does a decent job as Nimitz and Quaid did very well as Halsey.As stated above, this a very fast paced film which starts with the reason why the US carriers were not at Pearl on 7 Dec 41, then moves quickly through some other actions to include the Marshalls, Dolittle Raid, Coral Sea and then on to Midway. Considering the amount of action in this film, I feel the Dolittle Rain could have been omitted and the scenes from China should also have been absent. That said, considering there was a Chinese production company putting money into this film, I think directors and writers were forced into this. The main reason I feel the Dolittle Raid should have been eliminated was there was A LOT omitted about the planning from the Japanese side and US side that was very important and the ""fog of war"" issues that dogged Nagumo during the battle itself. These issues really could have helped the understanding of the decisions the commander made during the battle.There is on BIG issue I took with the film. During the first attacks on the Japanese carriers, a B-25 was hit and nearly hit Nagumo's carrier, which the pilot was trying to hit the carrier because he could not return to base. The film portrayed Nagumo reactions to the apparent attempt by the American pilot to ram the carrier as a coincidence saying ""Americans are not that brave"". In reality, Nagumos writings indicate that incident shook him to this core and made him reassess US forces as whole. This film did not show that.All that said, this film is very much so worth watching."
"I will start off by saying that the visuals & sounds are incredible on this movie, you have got to watch it in iMAX to appreciate the full meaning of the movie.The movie to most people might look like some talking followed by some flying around, but it is much more than that, you have got to realise what the film is telling you, people do not get that back then there was no internet or super computers to decode messages & transcripts, we solely relied on these brave people back then to decode these messages from the enemy & literally gamble our entire fleet of ships & planes on these messages, just let that sink in for a while, because of that the film keeps you really hooked when they are talking about where to attacked to guess where the enemy are going to attack next.Now the visuals / action part of the film is really well done, again just think what planes they are in, what equipment they have to hand, they had to win no matter what, the scale of the ships & the planes are superb, especially when it shows the Japan flagship carrier, there is some great flying in the sky when they try to evade each other, the dive parts of the film are really epic, it shows a plane literally diving nose down to a enemy ship trying to get a bomb on them, a few times they miss & it literally makes you go ""Ahhhhh!"", its got you on such a edge you are literally wanting them to win & cheer them on.Overall this is one of the better war films out there, good story & great visuals you cant go wrong.

"This review will be short as many of the previous reviewers have done an excellent job extolling the strengths of this film. Like most, I am a fan of the 1976 version, but really enjoyed how this film tied in Pearl Harbor while injecting just the right amount of Japanese Navy perspective/actions. I am a retired Naval Aviator with a Father and 3 Uncles who fought in the Pacific during WWII. I saw the movie with a retired 3 Star Army General who has published a number of critically accepted books on the art of war......and we both loved this movie. I provide the resume solely to note that we were critical of the films accuracy as well as the outstanding acting/writing/effects. Like Tora Tora Tora, I would not be surprised to see this movie gain status as a war classic with time."
"Since practically the dawn of cinema, there has been something about war films that have captured the attention of filmmakers and the public alike. Perhaps due to it taking place amid Hollywood's Golden Age, World War II especially has earned something of a prime spot. Midway, the latest film from Rolland Emmerich, proves that interest is still very much alive.In looking over Emmerich's filmography, there are usually three things one can be confident about going in knowing. The first is that he can assemble an excellent cast, and Midway is no exception to that. To tell the story of a tide-turning battle and the man who fought it, he's assembled one that takes in a wide range. There are the comparatively fresh faces of Ed Skrein and Luke Evans as the lead characters, two naval aviators who take viewers into the heat of battle. Elsewhere, established character actors like Patrick Wilson take us into the back rooms, as do the likes of Dennis Quaid and Woody Harrelson playing Admirals Halsey and Nimitz, respectively, showing the strategies been laid out at the upper levels of command. The Japanese side of the cast is equally steadfast, lead by Etsushi Toyokawa as Admiral Yamamoto. Meanwhile, the civilian side of the war comes from Mandy Moore's character, the wife of Skrien's pilot, though it is something the film doesn't give much time toward portraying. On the whole, though, they do an excellent job bringing the history to life sincerely.The second point of confidence is that an Emmerich film will be a special effects feast. Midway, too, scores on that point. From the attack on Pearl Harbor that comes a short way into the film to the Doolittle raid and the climactic ait attacks during the titular battle, the film does everything in its power to make viewers feel like they're flying alongside these men. Something which the film does with some fine CGI work that creates everything from early war Hawaii, to the ships and planes involved. Combined with all the other tricks of the trade, from the editing of Adam Wolfe to the score from frequent Emmerich collaborators Thomas Wander and Harald Kloser, the result is some of the finest aerial dogfights you're likely to see anytime soon.The final thing on our Emmerich checklist regards the script. As has been the case throughout his career, but especially in the last decade or so, he's a director with a habit of getting ones full of interesting ideas but often cliched or merely functional dialogue. Midway, though based around historical events, does suffer from some of these faults as well, especially where its dialogue is concerned though the actors do their best with it, helping to mitigate the worst of it.On the other hand, it's the historical elements that make Midway stand out. In presenting what is essentially a Cliff Notes version of the early Pacific War, Emmerich and writer Wes Tooke pack a largely accurate history lesson inside an action movie. Viewers get to see battles going down, the decisions leading up to them, and what it was like to face life and death during them. It allows the film to cover a lot of ground in a mere138 minutes, something which isn't always to its advantage (as the short-shifting of things like the Doolittle Raid and an underutilized Aaron Eckhart can attest). Despite that, it's hard not to think of it as the best script he's had since at least 2012 and maybe even longer ago than that.Indeed, one might go so far as to call it Emmerich's best film since that 2009 outing. It has all the ingredients of his better work, as well as some of the flaws, and tells a fascinating real-life story to boot. Along the way, it also proves one adage to still be true: that truth can be just as compelling, and stranger, than fiction."
"Liked the movie. Did not like the veiled, and inconsistent, criticism of Leyton. He, nor Kimmell was responsible for Pearl Harbor. This is totally on FDR and Washington. If they, with FDR's concurrence, had not ignored Leyton's intelligence then Kimmell would have received and then made (different) preparations.This policy, that intelligence had to be ""approved"" by Washington, was in an around about way, stated by Nimitz when he told Leyton ""If you think it's Midway, you need to get Washington to agree"".Leyton was always upstanding and outstanding, same for Kimmell and his family and today's descendants (I am not one). FDR, never had use for him."
"The title of this review about does it. GUNG HO mindlesslessness. Dennis Quad's character arc as Halsey is that he gets the shingles. Harrelson as Nimitz learns to trust his intel officers. and Ed Skrein hits the screen in a ridiculous rendition of a NY(?) accent that softens somewhat as his lines become fewer and fewer. It's basically a live action cartoon rather than a detailed accounting.For the people who are going to scream that I'm unpatriotic or know nothing about film making; I worked in film and television for 20 years, my uncle was B-17 pilot in Europe (later becoming a General in the Air Force Reserves), a cousin who served with the marines in the Pacific, my father was an F-86 pilot during Korea and a US Ambassador, we have a West Point grad in the family, a Navy Captain and many friends who served and still do. So yes, Veterans Day means a lot.Be well all."
"I can't believe how anyone would call this an excellent / worth to see WW2 movie. Not arguing the historical background of the battle but how Emmerich is turning the events into Independence Day in the Pacific is a disgrace.The intentional deadstick Landing on the Carrier would have been the right moment to leave the cinema. It would have saved me 2 hours of my life I will never get back. I could go on for hours ranting about this terrible movie but I will stop wasting more time on this utter crap.Kids, if you want to watch realistic war movies go and see tora tora tora or Battle of Britain.Avoid this mess at all cost."
"This film is an absolute mess. Screenplay is all over the place - so difficult to follow events. Characters are blank and shallow. Computer games look more realistic than this picture - effects are good from far but far from good. Film may have some historical value but from the cinematography point of view it sucks and I hope the credits start with ""sorry for what you've witnessed"". That I wouldn't know as I walked out after nearly 2 hours in the cinema. I'd love to see film telling Midway story but not as terrible as this one."
"This film is your standard, cookie-cutter war flick with way too many repetitive action sequences that all look the same after awhile. The dialogue isn't captivating, and the connection between the audience and the characters is lacking. Some characters have significant scenes, and then don't show up again for what seems like forever. The CGI is okay, but overdone and more practical effects would have made it feel more real."
"As usual, liberal critics who hate America and nationalism bashed this movie. I went in wanting to hate it completely, I had a discounted ticket and just wanted to get out to the theater because I'm working a very stressful job now. Ed Skrein did an amazing job and Roland Emmerich did an amazing job recreating 1940s America and the Navy. Many directors just choose to hire today's flavor of the day actors and won't even make them adopt period-accurate hair styles and personalities. Even Saving Private Ryan was pretty bad about that, with soldiers talking like they were from the modern day, haircuts that the actors wear everyday, there was just little effort put into recreating the period.I was pleasantly surprised at the battle scenes. From what I've read of the actual Midway battle, they got many of the details that I remembered fairly accurate. I'm no expert, but at no point was there any head-scratching moment like you saw in ""The King"" or ""Outlaw King"" where they had something ridiculous happen like the King of France trying to fight the King of England 1v1 and getting killed by some ordinary soldiers after slipping in the mud, lol! To make matters worse, that's a Netflix movie, not something commercially released in theaters! I think if this movie was that ridiculous, it would have FDR in one of the dive bombers or something, good lord.I will definitely be buying this on home video when it is released. I am impressed. Do not listen to the critics."
"The CGI is smooth..wish the movie in 3D format, so you will feel more at the war. Woody as C.W Nimitz, really match. The dog fight has a good scene even it was made from CGI. I thought Dolittle will mention the name of two guys from the Pearl Harbour, so it will like, Midway as a part of Pearl Harbour. Anyway, welldone,Roland. You make me feel as part of that movies. First time i saw the Yamato's ship.. welldone, guys..ððð"
"Extremely poor acting from Ed Skreen who makes a mockery of his character. The few well-known names have little to add but generic poses and postures. The script and dialog were absolutely awful. Actors constantly have to explain things that supposedly happened before but weren't shown. Breaking rule #1 of filmmaking: show, don't tell.Flabbergasted why this film has 10/10 ratings. You've got to be kidding me. By the way, was this a pro-China propaganda movie? I don't believe Roland Emmerich had anything to do with this. That's got to be a ""ok, put my name on it, but I'm too busy to even look at it""."
"In terms of the Spirit and realism of WWII the characters were real and loyal to the spirits and souls they represented. They say that great men, and women, rise to their best when when times are at their worst. That was certainly true for those involved during the Battle of Midway.Still, the folks responsible for making the movie, the CGIs, made one big mistake. During the opening scenes of the battle of Midway one sees a large flight of two engine bombers going after the Japanese carriers. Problem is that Midway never had any two engine bombers. They only, ever, had the larger and heavier, four engine B-17 bombers. And, they were awfully happy to have them. The two engine bombers were B-25s just as were flown from the carriers when Tokyo was bombed. No B-17 ever took off from a carrier and no B-25 ever took off from Midway.Also, Dan McClusky did not follow a Japanese destroyer back to the Japanese fleet. He made an educated guess that turned out to be right. God was with him that day.Finally everyone should know that the name of the downed flyer who floated around in his life vest watching the big show was Ensign George Gay. He survived the war.I know these things because my 100 year old father-in-law flew bombers for the Army Air Force . He ended up asan Aircraft Commander of a B-29 who flew 35 combat missions over the Empire."
"Nice movie it's not a spoiler at all ignore studio views if you like historic WW movies it's a good movie every one knows about the history of pearl Harbour.
Good to see this Epic Mid way battle on big screen"
"I saw the original when it came out in 1976 and now this one which I felt like I was watching a video game with their cheap CGI rather than a movie. On the plus side, there was no Matt Garth, not ""I'm in love with a Japanese woman"" junk and the Japanese spoke, well, Japanese but that was about the only redeeming value. And just like the movie Pearl Harbor, they went to a brief clip of Yamamoto uttering the line ""I fear that all we have done was to awaken a sleeping giant......."" and just like Pearl Harbor, the audience who has little clue of the history of the Pearl Harbor attack, do not know why he would've said such a thing or even thought it since it's still debatable if he actually said that line in real life or something similar. In Tora! Tora! Tora!, the audience knew exactly why such a line would've been said. The flying sequences were downright ridiculous with planes flying so low that they flew in between the battleships and 20 feet off the ground and down a street and in between buildings, trees and telephone poles or the way Dick Best would land his plane on the carrier. I just wish these movies would focus more on the historical accuracies rather than focus completely on dazzling us with their CGI. At least this wasn't a romance movie in which a war inconvenienced them and Benn Affleck taking to the skies during the Pearl Harbor attack, and taking part in the Doolittle Raid, after coming back from England of course where he defeated the German Luftwaffe!"
"How could anyone tell this story and not mention Cook Clealand , callsign ""Cookie"" and Ensign George Gay who was shot down and watched the entire battle from the water. Cook sank the last Japanese carrier by diving on it and blowing off the entire stern. I knew them. Spoke with them... Got the stories first hand. I am a Navy pilot and the false carrier landings mock the skill of Naval Aviation."
Not near as good as the 1976 all star Midway movie. Some parts were different and it was hard to follow. I felt like I wasted my money.
Great movie. Better story. Thought they did a great job kept it entertaining and not too Hollywood.
Great War and love story. Brought tears several times.
"Finally a movie about ww2 with no stupid subplot. Show us the battles, the tactics, the carnage, make it as big as it was, with cgi nothing is holding you back. You cannot make up a story more interesting than the real deal, so please please don't try. (Saving private Ryan is a prime example of a moronic plot in a ww2 setting.) The cgi has been criticised, I cannot see why. They are great and necessary, because there are not a fleet of veteran warplanes and -ships laying around to blow up. I hold one star back because they held back on the blood and guts, which needs to be there, because they are in war. War is not a sport, it is awful, and should be shown that way. This is a true war movie about the war itself. I do not care if the lines are sparse and cheesy, ww2 is not primarily remembered for its dialogues but for the total chaos which swept around the globe and left a wake of death and destruction in a scale never seen before or since."
"Definitely worth seeing. If you don't know the history beforehand ; don't read it up until afterwards, to avoid too many spoilers."
"This movie gives the viewer an edge of your seat experience as the attack on Pearl Harbor unfolds and then it delves into the importance of the ever changing dynamics of intelligence and counterintelligence ,who wins the cat and mouse game.Overiding all of this though is the bravery and sacrifice of men on both sides , their courage and sacrifice in battle is and was nothing less than astonishing....the relatively small theatre i saw this in(not far from where Doolittle trained) stod and applauded at the end !"
"The critic consensus is quite gloomy, painting the film as poorly executed and at times, slow. What it really is, is an almost lovingly accurate retelling of the entire story... including the motivations and actions leading up to Pearl Harbor, the lives and stories of some of the incredible heroes, and even some aspects of political climate on the Japanese side (which I can personally testify are quite correct). The critics seem to be dismayed that the special effects don't take center stage and that the explosions and action are not more fast-paced, but this is a movie about history and real people, not the latest installment in that horrid Transformers franchise. Those interested in feeling the tension and motivations of the actual people and even their families and getting a true picture of some of the incredible heroism, skill, and luck that made Midway the turning point in the Pacific War, instead of the prelude to the invasion of our West Coast, should really enjoy this."
I like watching this movie in 4DX thearter more bacause I feel like I was a pilot in a dive bomber aircraft.
"It's not Pearl Harbor. There's no crazy love triangle. Pearl Harbor was attacked, the department of the navy struggled to out plan and outplay the Japanese superior fighting force. Watch the movie. Learn the history. This is a must watch."
"This movie is history. It is not a statement on social Justice or equal rights for anybody. If you wanna dip your toe back in time when all the action took place at the hands of men and big metal machines then this is your movie. The battle scenes are incredible. In fact, the movie is just one long battle scene. Detail was not sacrificed for special of facts. You really feel like you are in the plane or on the boat. Anyone intrested in World War II should see this film. Roland Emmerich crafted a surprisingly well done tribute to both the American and Japanese soldiers who fought this horrendous war."
"I highly recommend this movie.
I saw it twice. If you can see it at the AMC In Dolby cinema that would be the best."
"While I don't doubt there are some mild inaccuracies in this film, it does a wonderful job of showing the courage of the men involved, and the high role fate, bad decisions and chance played in our history. I am not normally a big historical war movie fan, but this was an exceptionally good film that really highlights how close our history came to being much different.Incredibly well done, and full of great moments, it is a surprisingly good story that covers the characters that form the core of this story, and gives some good insight into the key events and how important they were. Note the importance China had in this story that is almost unknown here.Very popcorn-worthy, and highly recommended."
"I didn't expect much when I went to see this movie on Veterans Day, but I was pleasantly surprised with the acting, the cinematography, and the screenplay. I'm a historian, albeit not a World War II one. Nonetheless, I'm well versed in the era, and the movie did a good job looking at real-life individuals as well as fictional ones as supporting characters in a great narrative. The balance to the storytelling was good, too, giving insight into the Japanese mindset of the time period. There is really only one scene-other than the bombing of Pearl Harbor, of course-where the audience truly can lose respect for the Japanese side of the story. That balance is key to making a good film these days. Who knew Dennis Quaid and Woody Harrelson still had it in them, either? Nicely done by the director to bring out those key performances. The cinematography of the air battles is pretty intense, putting the viewer right in the cockpit insanity of the situation. This is a longer movie, yet it never feels that way, because the screenplay/editing is pretty good. Highly recommend!"
"I liked the way the film showed the fighter's camaraderie, fears, and courage (in action). Made me want to learn more about my grandpa's story fighting in the war."
"I thought this movie was very good.
The critics righting bad on this one have it all wrong.
This one is worth the money. You will not be disappointed."
"This movie was a boiler-plate but satisfactory action movie, though weighed down by a poorly written, terribly constructed, and woodenly acted script, with some dialogue so clunky, I could almost see the words land on the ground with a thud as soon as they left the actors' mouths. It's filled with a cavalcade of young, nubile Hollywood hunks (Nick Jonas, Ed Skrein, Keean Johnson, Darrin Criss), as well as a smattering of grizzly veterans (Dennis Quaid, Woody Harrelson) and an openly gay actor (Luke Evans) successfully playing against type, and while it was just this side of jingoistic, it didn't demonize the Japanese as much as it could have. We probably enjoyed it more than we might have, having just watched the episode in the Netflix WWII docuseries about the battle. Definitely not the best war movie I've ever seen, but enjoyable enough so as not to be completely wretched (damning with faint praise, I know)."
Overall a solid movie. Does get a little long and drawn out at times. Occasionally doesn't explain everything going on well so prior knowledge of the events make the movie far more enjoyable.
"One good thing about this movie is that it has a great cast which each important character has its own fair share of time and it sticks to the facts pretty well. From the start to finish, there isn't much dull moments and there is always something heroic actions and building up characters which is important for the later scenes.There is a balance scenes and moments between Americans and the Japanese which is quite a good thing as isn't biased on any side. The movie kinda have many great historic moments alongside with the CGI scenes not the best as practical effect from Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, but it's still pretty impressive on some of the scenes.However the score of the movie does lack a little, and it just needs a little more punch and more dramatic score to match up with those battle moments, just a bit lack of tense in the music design.Overall not bad for this movie. Great time if you wanna learn more about this great historical moments of WW2. Worth a shot !"
"Absolutely a great well told terrifically acted movie. How can these knuckleheads critics bash this film. I'm so tired of transformers and kid animation and X-Men London has Fallen crap . Here is our history not 100 percent accurate but pretty darn close and my local paper had 2 stars keeping people away. I haven't been to a movie since Bohemian Rhapsody because it has been a very dry year for movies with substance. Entertaining from start to finish, I truly think the scenes they used in trailers don't do the realism of Midway any favors and make it look too much like Pearl Harbor the only scenes I thought were too much were the dive bombing flack shots . I liked the Japanese side being shown and in the proper language. The intelligence chess game both countries played was terrific. Plus the Doolittle raid and what they did to the Chinese for helping them. Well add this to Bo Rhap, Hostiles and Greatest Showman that the critics and their self agendas and or kick backs totally don't have a clue and why our society has no attention span and sense of history. They come out with another transformer movie and give it 4 stars and tell everybody how great it is I will rest my case."
"I guess Dennis Quaid, seeing his future as just an esurrance spokesman wanted to go out and prove he could be part of a movie worse than Jaws 3. I went in with expectations so low, I figured I'd have to be pleasantly surprised, but with acting worse than Daytime Soaps, ludicrous action scenes, and annoying a-hole characters, I was actually happy when the Japanese killed them, which I didn't think could ever be possible. This movie is a cliff note version of early WWII naval action made for video gamers with Attention Deficit Disorder with too many faults to mention. Terrible movie from the opening flight scene to the last cornball line. The only reason I didn't walk out of my empty theater, is that I wanted to see if the next scene could possibly be worse, and here, the director didn't fail. Crap building on crap that Hercules couldn't shovel. Purely an absolute waste of time. A complete joke."
"Greetings again from the darkness. Japan's World War II goal was to devastate the United States Navy fleet in the South Pacific, thereby securing the area as their own and crippling the U.S. military beyond hope. The December 7, 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor was the first step and the most infamous. Over the next few months, what followed were the Raid on Tokyo (April 1942), Battle of Coral Sea (May 1942) and the Battle of Midway (June 1942). Stating that these battles changed the war is not an understatement, as the Imperial Japanese Navy had previously been viewed as superior (especially after the destruction at Pearl Harbor). Director Roland Emmerich (THE PATRIOT, INDEPENDENCE DAY) has never met a war or explosion or special effect he didn't like, so we know going in that, given the subject matter and the filmmaker, the screen will be filled with action.Emmerich co-wrote the script with Wes Tooke (his first feature script), and as with many WWII movies, it acts as a history lesson on a war that changed the world. This one focuses on naval strategy and particularly on the individuals who defined courage and heroism ... many names we recognize from history books. The contrast between Japanese military leaders and United States military leaders is on full display, and it's no surprise that the Japanese leaders are mostly portrayed as cold and calculating, while the U.S. leaders come across as more humanistic and resourceful. Pride is evident on both sides - it's just displayed differently.The players are crucial to the story. Woody Harrelson plays Admiral Chester Nimitz, Dennis Quaid is Vice Admiral ""Bull"" Halsey (commander of aircraft carrier USS Enterprise), Patrick Wilson is Intelligence Officer Lieutenant Commander Edwin Layton, Jake Weber is Rear Admiral Raymond Spruance, Luke Evans is Lieutenant Commander Wade McClusky, Brennan Brown plays Joseph Rochefort (leader of the code breaker team), and Aaron Eckhart is Lieutenant Colonel Jimmy Doolittle, the extraordinary pilot who led the Raid on Tokyo in April 1942. On the Japanese side, Tadanabu Asano plays Rear Admiral Yamaguchi (commander of the aircraft carrier Hiryu), Jun Kunimura is Admiral Nagumo (he of questionable battle decisions), and Enushi Toyokawa plays Admiral Yamamoto, the most dignified and influential of the Japanese leaders.Much of the story is told from the perspective of naval pilot Lieutenant Dick Best (Ed Skrein, DEADPOOL). While personal stories and challenges faced by individuals makes for a relatable story for viewers, there is something about this particular actor that comes across as awkward and difficult to bond with. There is no doubting the character and courage of Dick Best as a pilot; however, Skrein's performance is flat out annoying and distracting. The dive bombing missions are breathtaking and thrilling, but overall the liberal use of green screen for effects detracts from the realistic looks we've come to expect for war movies.Mandy Moore as Anne Best, and Nick Jonas as a mechanic, are cast for relatability by viewers, but the value in the film comes from an easy-to-follow description of the contrasting strategies of the two militaries. It's also a reminder that the ""big"" story of WWII is comprised of many individual stories of people ... people who were brave and heroic in a time of need. So ignore the cheesy affects, unrealistic dialogue, and irritating performances, and instead take in the work and actions of those who saved the world."
"Terrible script, sub-par acting and horrible CGI, also circa 80% of the movie was CGI... I mean come on, they could've tried to get like one real boat and take it out to sea.The Japanese commanders were a positive note in the movie.Midway isn't the worst movie ever made, but it comes very close to being the worst."
Wow it's pretty much Independence Day 2 mixed in with WW2 planes and battleships .... characters that go nowhere .......cgi planes that operate like Star Wars space ships ...... and the uniforms that are so wrinkled you will wonder when the iron was invented ......Ronold mc Donald' sombody should tell him to stop directing these big loud messes ( he's never going to top Spielberg )1 Star ..... and that's for the popcorn I ate
"Great action with good (not great) historical perspective. Good CGI and pretty good acting. But this is not for the younger crowd as they really don't give a rat about what the greatest generation sacrificed to keep this country from being a Japanese protectorate are a part of Germany. Sad, really. A 21 year old kid back then and a 21 year old kid now days. Watch for the China references when the credits roll - it's more than a little disconcerting."
"It's a hollow, vacuous and impersonal dramatisation of an integral Pacific battle that ultimately makes Michael Bay's Pearl Harbour a comparative masterpiece! Seriously, what did you expect from the man who directed 2012 and Universal Soldier?At least Pearl Harbour had panache. Midway is a soulless experience that lacks even the faintest flicker of a visual flair. Viewers are taken through the events of December 1941 as a means to explain how it led up to the Battle of Midway between America and Japan in June 1942.On paper at least, Roland Emmerich, as the master of disaster, was probably the best man to handle and choreograph the carnage of Midway. However, he relies on a jarring overuse of shoddy Chinese CGI that desperately lacks the practical authenticity of Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk. I realise however, that due to the sheer scale of destruction that occurred at Midway, a minimal use of CGI would have proved virtually impossible. But it didn't have to look so cheap and distracting.The effects however, were not nearly as distracting as Nick Jonas or likewise, Woody Harrelson's wig. Characters are threadbare and underdeveloped. Ed Skrein (Deadpool) is oddly miscast as Lt. Dick Best (Dick Best, I mean really?), a steely do-or-die squadron leader with a dubious and unconvincing New Jersey accent.Patrick Wilson, Dennis Quaid and Mandy Moore are all fine in their thankless roles but it's the majority of the other characters, including Dick Best (stop sniggering!), that are annoying and cliched caricatures that are high on the fumes of American patriotism and gung-ho jingoism. Not only that but the dialogue is conventional and expositional at best and toe curling at its worst.It's not all terrible though! Firstly, the runtime is mercilessly shorter than Pearl Harbour whilst some of the action is, on occasions, quite exciting. It's also, for the most part, historically accurate but it was the sensitive portrayal of the Japanese that surprised me most. Unlike their American onscreen adversaries, they are not caricatures of themselves.But none of that is not nearly enough to outweigh the criticisms, which is a shame because Midway is an important story of WW2 that deserves to be told, just like Dunkirk, D-Day, Stalingrad and the Battle of the Bulge. Emmerich was not the right man to tell this story.3.5/10"
"This is the worst movie that I can currently remember watching. 0 character development, cheesy closeup shots, scenes with no context. (They're hunting ducks, They're at a ball, they're at pearl harbor, they're at a bar, they're on a plane.) It's comical how this movie jumps from terrible cgi firefights but are then magically teleported safely to the next scene. I honestly found myself laughing in disbelief."
"I really was hoping for a rousing retelling of this important turning point of a battle. But I was highly distracted by the clunky dialogue, the slow manner in which the actors spoke their lines, the one-person-speaks-at-a-time approach and the crappy editing of the non action sequences. This is not the actors' fault but rather the director and the editor who are to blame. Who talks like that in real life? Some of the dialogue sequences were making me laugh because they were so cringe-worthy. This, for me, was the biggest reason for not rating this movie higher than a five. What kept me from rating it lower were the effects. Oh, one more thing; were irons and ironing boards not around during this time period? Not one character had a pressed uniform. I laughed as I typed that. Now that you know, however, try to keep a straight face when you see the American uniforms. You've been warned."
One of the worst movies I've seen in a long long time. The acting is atrocious. The CGI is laughable. I actually laughed out loud several times at the cliched dialog. We left after only 30 minutes because we just couldn't take anymore. My husband is a veteran and this movie was so poorly done it just made him mad.
"I'm genuinely shocked at all the 10/10 reviews here - we must have seen different films, as I found Midway a bit of a mixed bag to say the least! It's in a very similar league to Michael Bay's Pearl Harbor. Amazing action sequences of planes attacking ships (reminiscent of Star Wars space battles - a credit to George Lucas for setting the standard), but the rest of it is pretty duff - I guess I shouldn't have expected too much more from action director Roland Emmerich.A lot of the time, it felt like I was watching a Commando-style comic book (""Take that, boche!""). All the characters were muscular and had prominent chiselled chins. The script was pretty awful. One of the main characters was called Dick Best (at the end it was revealed he was real), a gum-chewing maverick pilot, and so there were lines like, ""It's because of men like Dick Best that we'll win this war!"", or ""Goddammit Dick Best!!"" As well as a comic book feel, it came across as a propaganda war film. It was unbelievably full of cliche; I think the worst might have been when Dick Best flew his dive bomber the length of the Japanese carrier just above the deck to drop his bomb right through the very centre of the red sun painted on the deck, while snarling ""This one's for Pearl Harbor!"" One of the consequences of this cliche was that it made it hard to care about any of the characters. There was only one line I enjoyed: Woody Harrelson saying something about a man in fuzzy slippers leading a bunch of tuba players to crack the Japanese codes.It followed a potted history of the war in the Pacific from Pearl Harbor, through the Doolittle raid (including a sequence where Doolittle is in China), Coral Sea, and then to a longer sequence about the Battle of Midway, all in 2hrs 20 mins, so quite a pace of events. I don't understand why a film called ""Midway"" needed to cram all this in.Lots of things irked me. For instance, during the Pearl Harbor attack, I couldn't understand why the Japanese fighters kept strafing perfectly between the US battleships, instead of strafing the actual ships. Or, after Doolittle bails out in China, he hooked up with some Chinese guerrillas, and as they leave a village it is subjected to a raid by Japanese bombers. ""But there's no installations here!!"" cries out Doolittle in melodramatic anguish, and one of the Chinese peasants replies to him in English something like ""They're not bombing installations, they're bombing the people!"" Yet 10 mins earlier we watched Doolittle flying over densely populated Tokyo merrily dropping bombs everywhere.The portrayal of the Japanese was pretty poor. It was interesting that an attempt was made to show the Japanese side, but it was half-hearted and entirely served the purposes of exposition. Whenever we switched to a Japanese scene, the soundtrack helpfully signalled it with Japanese traditional music (no reciprocal traditional American music for the American scenes). There are no named Japanese characters apart from the Japanese admirals making their fateful decisions, though there are some hapless sailors saying things like ""This place is a tinderbox"" as they reload planes.Worth seeing for the drama of aircraft diving through flak to bomb ships (and bringing to mind what must have been the incredible bravery of the aircrew), but the rest of the drama is pretty terrible. On reflection, it's actually almost indistinguishable from Pearl Harbor."
"Ho-hum is as good a description as any for this totally superfluous remake. When the cgi calls attention to itself and compares unfavourably with the 'special effects' of entries like In Which We Serve released three quarters of a century ago you know the script is strictly from hunger. Unfortunately the overall feel is of a group of students in their last year of film school being provided with cameras, raw stock, an editing suite, and given their heads. Certainly worth a look but equally certainly not more than one."
"I quite enjoyed Midway: it is actually a solid, very watchable movie, professionally crafted, rich with spectacular scenes.
Point is, it also is a very, very conventional movie; Midway is not able to propose one single fresh, surprising scene - let alone concept - apart from the usual orgy of CGI. The movie proposes such an unlikely quantity of incredible heroic acts to make heroism a commodity. The actors performances are also quite professional, but they are terribly retro, vintage...Midway actually could have been a phenomenal ""colossal movie"" of the 50' or 60's.
So, I enjoyed it today and I am sure I will have forgotten it tomorrow..."
"First I would recommend you watch a documentary beforehand explaining exactly what the battle of Midway was all about, and why that tiny little island was so important. The movie will not break it down very well for you.
The special effects were very good and will keep your heart pounding.I would give this film a much higher score if the main character could act his way out of a paper bag. British guy trying to sound like an American smartass. I could not relate to him at all. Besides his horrible fake accent the guy couldn't portray emotion. It was terrible and cast a long shadow over otherwise superb supporting actors."
"I pretty like story telling with such straight way.War is cruel as always,love the peace,remember all the heros,that's all."
"Midway works fine for what it is --- a direct account of events leading up to and including the famous sea and air battle. It is much like ""Tora! Tora! Tora!"" in its approach, and is far superior to ""Pearl Harbor."" Both the Americans and the Japanese are depicted respectfully, while not ignoring Japanese atrocities. It's a good balance, and accurate.For my taste, the heavy reliance on CGI had weak moments (especially the Pearl Harbor"" sequence), but the action surrounding the battle of Midway itself is done quite well. My wife was leaning forward in her seat, fully engaged in the life or death struggle. One cannot help but come away with enormous respect for the young flyers who faced almost certain death to cripple the Japanese navy at a dire moment."
"This movie was very well done, the acting was very decent, the script was respectful of the content it was covering and quite suspenseful and the effects were very decent.It may not be in line with some of the classic movies but its an extremely competent and well produced movie which is a genuine spectacle at the cinema.Well worth viewing I would say."
"What a missed opportunity! On one hand this movie has a great set up: a huge event that's easy to bring to film in a setting that's still somewhat overlooked when it comes to WW2 movies. It even manages to avoid the typical Pearl Harbor pitfalls and doesn't really bother with romantic subplots getting in the way of the main story. It's also a giant CGI fest that turns out pretty good. Mostly.On the other hand...acting is bad. Like. Really bad. The first act in particular is horrible. The story is jumping all over the place, trying to make us care about way too many characters. The main character even manages to be an utterly unlikable Dick (pun intended) that walks around like he's the best thing the US has to offer. CGI also looks fake as hell in the first act. It's the sort of thing that'll pop up on an episode of the How Did This Get Made podcast.Things sort of pick up in the second and third act with some impressive big fights but the story keeps on jumping around like it listened to Kriss Kross too much. The end is, of course, a giant Murica F Yeah eruption that had people during my viewing shaking their heads.
That might seem harsh, but maybe that's because there are the building blocks of a perfectly fine movie scattered all over the place. Better editing and storytelling would've made this movie genuinely good instead of mediocre.Not that it isnt enjoyable so it's not a total warning to skip it. It's just... Meh."
"I saw ""Midway"", starring Ed Skrein-Alita:Battle Angel, Deadpool; Patrick Wilson-Aquaman, Watchmen; Mandy Moore-This Is Us_tv, 47 Meters Down and Luke Evans-the Fast & Furious movies, The Three Musketeers_2011.
This movie is based on real life events that happened in the Pacific Ocean during 1941. It starts with the Pearl Harbor attack by Japan and continues through to the battle of Midway. It shows both sides of the conflicts-the American Fleet vs the Japanese Navy-but leans heavily on the Americans' struggles, of course. Ed plays a top pilot with Mandy as his concerned wife. Patrick is the head of military intelligence for the U.S. and Luke is another pilot. There are several good cameos-I remember seeing Woody Harrelson, Dennis Quaid, Aaron Eckhart and Nick Jonas-and lots of excellent battle scenes. During the end credits, the real people the actors are portraying are shown and you learn what happened to them after Midway. If you are a WW2 fan/buff, you should enjoy this one.
It's rated ""PG-13"" for war violence, language and smoking and has a running time of 2 hours & 18 minutes.
It's not one that I would buy on DVD-once was enough-but it would be a good rental."
"From top to bottom its a fantastic film on a great portion of the war. They, along with historians, dont oversrate how pivotal Midway was for the Pacific theatre and WWII in general. The cast is absolutely stacked and not one of them is there to steal the show, everyone is pushing the story forward and making it an excellent overall picture.On a side note the CGI is stunning in this, it feels like you're seeing a documentary but in high definition.If you like war films or the greatest generation, its a must watch."
"Basically a good movie but a bit drawn out in places with too much detail about their homelife and not enough detail about the planning, scouting raids etc. The expanse of the south pacific and the number of young men who were away from home for the first time doesn't come across either."
"This film is more of a caricature of a war film than it is a decent depiction of the most important naval battle of all time. Not even Dennis Quaid, Woody Harrelson, and Aaron Eckhardt could bring life to the completely dead script. On top of that, the CGI (which the film relies on heavily) is some of the worst I've seen in this decade. I literally started falling asleep in the climactic Midway sequence. Two thumbs down!"
"I suppose the millennial generation needs it's own version of films which were made 40 years ago in an attempt to improve it.Lots of cost-cutting is evident, too much CGI that looks fake. I'll take the 1976 version, especially the extended version which has the Coral Sea scenes. This one is a money waster, suitable for DVD."
"First Hit: Besides being too long, I didn't like and couldn't engage with the main character Dick Best (Ed Skrein).As portrayed here, Best was a pilot that liked breaking the rules, thought highly of himself and his skills, and eventually, his arrogance, depicted as bravery, helped to win the war over Japan at Midway.I don't know what it was, but if another actor played Best, I might have engaged more with this character. Actors from another time who would have made this role work would be Steve McQueen or Paul Newman. These guys had a way of being edgy but likable.There are other issues with this film that stood out as well. There were whole sections that were supposed to color the background but seemed needless. Additionally, the strategic planning of the attack on Midway became muddled.On a positive note, many of the action scenes were well choreographed and exciting to watch.This film is about how the battle of Midway became the turning point of the Pacific War between the United States and Japan. Early on, we see Pearl Harbor being bombed. This was particularly effective and was well depicted with the surprise and the panic that set in after the attack.The US goal was to hit back at Japan in a way that would have them rethink their choice to attach the United States.The key players in this story are Best, Lieutenant Commander Edwin T. Layton (Patrick Wilson), who was an intelligence officer, and Admiral Chester W. Nimitz (Woody Harrelson). Layton had developed data, with a team of intelligence analysts, that gave him a hunch that the Pearl Harbor attack was coming. Nimitz had heard about Layton's ideas and after his assignment to head the Pacific Fleet, he told Layton to bring him information that would allow his decimated fleet to execute a surprise counterattack.Midway was that surprise attack. In addition to this story, there were side stories. One was about Vice Admiral William ""Bull"" Halsey (Dennis Quaid), who was the on-boat commander of the aircraft carrier leading the fleet. He had a horrible case of shingles, which eventually put him out of commission. There was also a story about Lieutenant Colonel Jimmy Doolittle (Aaron Eckhart) who first bombed Japan, and because the way the mission worked out, he and his entire squadron had to ditch their planes because they ran out of fuel.There are also sweet scenes with Best and his wife Anne (Mandy Moore), one of the few who understood and embraced her husband's erratic intensity. There are also depictions of Japanese ship commanders and Admirals, which are brief and attempt to show the ignorance of and blind devotion to the war effort as commanded by their emperor.Skrein was not likable as Best. What I don't know was it Skrein or his character I didn't like or want to champion. Eckart, in the bombing of Japan side story, was solid as Doolittle. Wilson was excellent as the intelligence officer Layton. The scene where he is pressed for the details on the theory of a Midway attack by the Japanese was powerful. Harrelson gave a strong performance as Nimitz. His belief in his team, especially Layton, was well executed. Quaid was good as Halsey, a ""bull"" of a man. Moore was excellent as the trusting and understanding wife of the film's wildcard character. Wes Tooke wrote a meandering script that seemed to take in too many stories. Roland Emmerich had an excellent eye for many of the action scenes, but the story seemed to take too large a bite.Overall: Because I couldn't get into the main character, the film fell flat."
"Midway (3 out of 5 stars).Midway is a fair war film delivered by Roland Emmerich who makes films that are big blockbuster action movies. Midway is not a great war movie or a great film in general. It delivers on plenty of action sequences with aerial combat. Realistically it is no Dunkirk with the realism on the practical stunts than having actors sit in a stage production with all visual effects. The visual effects are decent. The script lacks in delivering characters that stands out. The story was okay about the Battle of Midway. Roland Emmerich's focuses on building the action suspense but not leaving any satisfaction in the end. I feel like this film does make Michael Bay's Pearl Harbor feeling like a masterpiece when it comes to a story with a forced love story, better action and aerial combat that puts you on the edge of your seat, and the emotional impact you have with the victims and soldiers that was under attack.What worked great with Midway? Well for a war film, Roland Emmerich does pack a punch with having a lot action in it. The cinematography was good and making you feel like you are with the pilots in the fighter planes. The opening sequence with Pearl Harbor being attacked tried to set the tone of the film. It was not as powerful like Michael Bay's Pearl Harbor. The rest of the film focuses on Dick (Ed Skrein) flying in the air, and getting into a lot of aerial combat with the Japanese. Dick is a cowboy, and cocky personality who flies and living on the edge when he is dive bombing. Evantually, the action sequences with aerial scenes do get repetitive. Dick and his other fighters flying high and dive bombing into a Japanese carrier. Hoping their missiles hit their ships.The film has a great cast ensemble. Sadly, none of the actors have room to develop their characters. Ed Skrein, Woody Harrelson, Patrick Wilson, Luke Evans, Mandy Moore, Nick Jonas, and Aaron Eckhart. None of the characters have a characterization which makes them standout. The script lacks in delivering actual people who went through these events. Instead, the film makes every character forgettable.The plot about the battle of Midway is a great feature to be brought onto film. After Pearl Harbor, Americans sent out several carriers to aid in Midway. Which American fighter pilots were trying to stop the Japanese carriers from beginning another attack. The movie lacks in delivering an emotional story when it is too focused on bringing flat characters from one set piece to another. Then, having the repetitive aerial battle throughout the two hour time frame.Overall, Midway is a fair war film. It delivers a lot of action and aerial combat. The visual effects are a little decent. The actors are forgettable with their characters from a shallow script. The story is lacking emotional depth with the characters."
"Went into this wanting to give the movie every chance, surely the CGI would look epic on the big screen? No, it doesn't. It looks at best like a Monday afternoon TV movie. The acting? Some big names, surely that'll be fine? NOPE. The guy playing Dick Best is almost chewing the scenery he hams it up so much, Woody Harrelson as Nimitz? Really? This is a truly terrible movie, but I heartily recommend it, It's so bad it's good."
"War is hell a wise person once said, and in many ways we the general public have no idea what it was like on those battlegrounds where so many sacrificed so much. Fortunately for many of us, the movies have offered a glimpse into the world, opening our eyes to the world that cares little of its soldiers in regards to decency and humane treatment. Many of these films are often about the action, and while not as prominent as they once were back in the day, they still offer some intense views of history. Past this introduction, this weekend, yet another historical remake is flying in to make a landing, in hopes of wowing the group once more with its depiction of the great war. Robbie K here with yet another review as we look into:Movie: Midway (2019)
LIKES:The Modern Technology Prowess
Multiple Aspect providing different viewpoints
The Intensity Of Some War Scenes
The Decent Acting
The Intelligence AspectDISLIKES:Disjointed Plot
Too many Perspectives
The Semi Forced Love Story
The Choppiness of the scenes
Semi-sloppy use of big names
The Action ScenesSUMMARY:Modern technology allows us to make things more realistic and engaging, and should in theory lead to better fights. In a way Midway accomplishes this by bringing the chaos with speaker booming effects, special effects that light up the screen, and dances with planes that once relied on plywood models. It is certainly the selling points of the trailers and should appeal to the modern audiences expectations as realism and style come together. This film though took a different approach compared to the previous theaters of war, not focusing so much on the action from America by itself, but instead dividing the focus between both parties involved. This dynamic is impressive to see because it helps show the strategy involved in something you have only read about in a history textbook, allowing for a different appreciation of the tactics in war. In fact, my favorite aspect, as well as my good buddy, both agreed that seeing the intelligence component involved with determining how to fight the Pacific campaign. Much of the film is dedicated to showing how codes were cracked, departments coordinated, and risks were taken to determine the best places to strike and this new perspective was very strongly placed. When the battles did finally occur, there are several moments where you get pulled into the intensity, feeling like you are part of the squad and in the cockpit during this operation. Nice editing on these parts, and quite an adrenaline rush at the times it works. Finally, the acting is not an issues in this film, as all personalities of war are brought in and everyone executes there roles quite well when they are on stage. I'm not saying Academy Award Level, but it's believable and appropriate for this film's approach.For all its worth though, there are several limitations for this reviewer that make the film a little less impressive compared to its predecessors. For one thing, the film feels disjointed, as our time hops and evolution of war occur a little too frequently to necessarily keep track of everything. All the pesrpectives, while again interesting, also have too much going on, leading to breaking up a lot of scenes just as they start cooking with gas. The result is a rather contained movie that struggles to find the approach it wants, with choppy scenes that sort of scatter the coordination rather than unite it. This is especially true for the romance story they try to put in here, which was unnecessary giving the presentation and could have been left out. Throw in several attempts at character development, the potential bonds that can form between a number of characters, and even the squad mates themselves and you again get sort of piece meal presentations that did not achieve what Pearl Harbor did long ago. Once more, this reviewer feels part of this is due to how many big names they have, trying to get the most out of the big price tags that come with them. Midway's crew acts just fine, but there were so many missed elements and character interactions that I feel many of these people were unnecessary. Certainly they were able to point out all the contributions they did, but to deny the full fledged chemistry and quality, well that was the disappointment for me. Finally, the action scenes. An action junky like me always crave for cohesive battle scenes that utilize their groups well, something that the early war movies, and even some films like Saving Private Ryan knew how to do. In this one, all the perspectives and heroes were scattered that the action scenes felt again very sloppy and short, chopped up moments that ended too fast or how long it took to start. Again realistically it accomplishes the portrayal, but at this point and with what the trailers built up... I wanted more out of a modern day, technological behemoth like this one looked to be.The VERDICT:Let's wrap it up then shall we? Midway accomplishes the idea of putting modern faces in traditional stories, and this theater of wars proves that trying new things does not always come together for this reviewer. Sure, the technological advantages are good and all the actors recruited do their parts to bring the group of heroes to life and retell the legacies of men who faced the demons of war. I'll also again give them props for focusing a lot on the strategy and intelligence required to pull off the miracle that we did. However, all of these perspectives and approaches to the story made for what looked like a difficulty to focus on the story they wanted to tell. The result is again a disjointed movie that struggles to bring A games to any perspective, and relies on B and C graded stories. Your truly would have loved a little more action to come together, as the trailers promised, but at least the intelligence parts work together to make for an engaging plot. For special effects it qualifies for a theater visit, but outside of that, hold this one for home viewing instead.My scores are:Drama/War/History/Action: 6.5
Movie Overall: 6.0"
"Midway was one of the best movies i have ever seen the acting was incredible and the graphics and the movie was just great and I always love the WWII Stories and i was not reluctant going in to this one because the trailers were great and they didn't disappoint me and they didn't miss anything everything was accurate nothing was made up. 10/10, would not be suprised if it wins an Oscar."
"For quite some time I haven't left the cinema with the bitter taste of disappointment. Until today!
This time Hollywood nailed it - the combination of incredible computer effects, great actors, following the real WWII story events and showing how it went for both sides simply made this movie one hell of a good entertainment.It makes you think - that the only war that should exist in this world should be in the movies!Go and watch it.

"I've taken my share of WW2 history but I never had to study the battle of Midway. So I walked into this fairly fresh and one of the more pleasant surprises was the more balanced look this movie presented. There's no confusing which side the movie is on but humanizing the antagonists always helps the drama sink in a little deeper and it helps sell how devastating this period of WW2 was. The actors playing the Japanese command (e.g. Etsushi Toyokawa and Tadanobu Asano) are given a lot of material to chew on and they succeed in getting you to at least look at their side of things. You still get the elements of cheering on the Americans (which is what most of the movie going public wants to see) but a bigger picture point of view is a unique element for Midway.Midway boasts a surprisingly large cast, its not full of a lot of A-list actors, but you've seen all these people working in mid-large budget releases or in some well reviewed TV dramas. Leading the cast is charming but unfortunately miscast Ed Skrein. He's normally playing a villain and I was intrigued to see him go a different direction. He's working hard here but he doesn't seem to fit what this movie is going for. It doesn't help that his accent is pretty rough, hopefully he'll bounce back. Woody Harrelson is the type of performer who can elevate substandard material but he's not putting much into his interpretation of Nimitz. Nick Jonas is fine as Bruno, he's a better actor than I thought he would be but considering his background in music, he's hard to buy as a tough guy type. Much like Harrelson, there's a lot of workmanlike effort put in here (Luke Evans, Mandy Moore, Aaron Eckhart come to mind). That doesn't make the acting bad, they're all performers that are easy to like, the acting just isn't something to write home about in Midway. I'd credit Patrick Wilson and Dennis Quaid for being the most effective (even if Quaid just growls through 90% of his scenes, at least he's good at it?).Emmerich has a more varied career as a director than you would think, but his main claim to fame is his big budget disaster flicks. You don't get those opportunities without knowing how to use special effects to deliver the goods on some action scenes (the overall quality of the movies... that's a different story). The movie didn't start well, I found the attack on Pearl Harbour to be underwhelming when it came to the action but there was plenty of movie still left to go. The scenes with Skrein's character in a dogfight or manoeuvring to dive bomb enemy ships were pretty intense and they really play up the chaotic nature of the battle. Everything is covered in smoke, shrapnel, or fire and it serves as another reminder that war is h#!! The movie delivered the thrills more regularly as it went on and by the end, I got what I wanted out of Midway.Midway falls into a category of movie that's tough to write about. Its hard to make pointed arguments or have poignant opinions about a mediocre movie. The really good ones and the really bad ones are the easiest to write about, its the movies that leave you shrugging your shoulders when you leave the theatre that really stall your creative impulses. This is a tough genre to stand out in too, there's so many great war movies, you really have bring something shocking or affecting to the table to grab the public's attention. Emmerich's ability to work with CGI and experience shooting big set pieces keep this movie afloat. Providing more context by showing the situation from both sides is also a nice bonus to Midway. But conversely there's the cliche dialogue, the middle of the road acting and the long running time dragging it down. I'm not shocked that Midway has surprised in theatres but I could have waited for Netflix and had a similar experience viewing it. The big action scenes are cool but nothing screamed ""I had to see this in a theatre!"" If I hadn't seen this with a good friend, I would have called it a disappointment. Its hard to recommend Midway with being over 2.25 hours long but I wouldn't stop you from checking it out. I'd avoid paying full price and just catch it on your preferred streaming service."
"This film deserves way more recognition than Dunkirk and a grade higher than 6.. The amount of tension, music and cockiness is way off the charts with this one. Lots of well known actors, well written and the pictures and effects are outstanding.
It depicts with accurace how much was sacrificed during the war."
"Engaging from the very beginning. For those who go to the movie to be entertained, this is terrific. If you are going for some kind of cerebral character endeavor you may find it but for me it is a great action movie that keeps you on edge from battle to battle. A really great film"
"I saw this movie on Veterans Day with my two sons. It was a good history lesson for me, and them. On the way home we talked about what the men in these battles experienced; they took off on their missions knowing very well there was a not-remote chance they wouldn't make it back. Yet they did what they had to do. I'm glad I saw it."
"This is an excellent, solid depiction of the WWII battle of Midway and the background surrounding it from both the American perspective and the Japanese. Excellent acting, which I expected from a cast like that, vivid graphics and great story. Plus, no smarmy love story and even better, NO POLITICS. How often do we get to see a picture like this without a political agenda? So refreshing."
"I'd give 10 except for casting. Regardless, everyone should see this blockbuster! My knock is on Woody Harrelson being cast as Admiral Chester Nimitz. This didn't seem the type of role for him given his prior filmography; however his physical likeness was close enough. Every time I saw Woody I expected some kind of goofiness to come out of this film, but he kinda proved some versatility here. Still... Anyhow, a truer tribute to those who fought, died, yet won this crucial battle in the Pacific. Anything below an 8 rating on this film is placed on ""ignore""..."
"No political agenda, no cheesy romance, just an account of what happened. It feels like your grandpa telling you stories about the war that people know very little about nowadays. When Veterans Day/remembrance day became a shopping day, at least somebody remembered the real heroes (as opposed to super heroes) and their heroic actions during the war."
"Was impressed by the film, which turned out to be better than I expected, certainly better than the 1976 ""Midway"" and vastly better than Michael Bay's ""Pearl Harbor"", which I consider to be a cartoon. You get a good history lesson on the first six months of the Pacific war, the portrayal of the intelligence efforts to set the stage for the battle is well done, the acting is decent for this kind of epic movie, and the CGI effects are excellent. Some of the battle scenes are actually terrifying, even though you know how events are going to turn out. Is it a perfect movie? Of course not, some of the inevitable war movie cliches crop up, and some facts get fudged, such as where the actions of U.S. fighter planes in the battle, as noted by others, are completely omitted, but still a good, respectable effort."
"The movie had a lot to cover in it's depiction of the Battle of Midway.
Short and sweet I thought it was an excellent movie. Great special effects and good story lines."
"Pretty gripping retell of an incredible battle that more citizens of the US need to know. Aside from the incredible battle scenes, the tension and grueling pressure of leadership placed on the shoulders of the military leaders on both sides adds great flavor to this epic film. You can't but help feel the strain on the wives of the pilots as well. Mandy Moore does an incredible job. I saw this in a theater sitting near silver haired veterans that were on the USS Yorktown, and USS Hornet. Grateful to all who have served!"
"Went in expecting a version of ""Pearl Harbor"" minus the romance. Went out wondering, perhaps alongside the romance, the editing dept. got snip-happy and hacked the film apart, only to have to tape it all back together again without much attention. Hard to follow even with BIG PRINT on the screen, as more often then not, those scenes were on the vast Pacific, not much to help the audience; planes, ships, submarines were suddenly one place before appearing/disappearing with little comprehension/logic.When the main actor, playing the role of Dick Best is unlikeable due to a fifties actor mockery, all brash, every word delivered from the side of his mouth, more hammed than all of Easter, yet none of the underlying charisma, can't invest much emotion. Nick Jonas matched in over-stated cheese'mo. Woody Harrelson was doing his best Bruce Willis impression, making that same Bruce face - no real effort at acting, a semi-smile leaking out of every shot. Real shame as I love Woody.Squeezed in a subplot about bombing Tokyo, with even a tighter fit, landing in China and squeezing in a scene that would get it onto the Chinese big screen. Unnatural.Code breakers bit could have been interesting. Editing could have made sense and not assumed the audience would fill in the blanks as would fans of Pacific military engagements.No reason a movie, a re-make, which was shooting for historic accuracy, couldn't have been well played on the big screen. Does an actor; director; producer ever sit back and watch the final product and sink into their chair and whisper, ""WTF, that's not how I imagined it would come out?"""
This movie makes no sense. You have to look it up to understand what the plot is. Worst movie of the year
"What did I really expect from a film by Roland Emmerich! But this does take some doing even by his standards, which is very hit or miss to say the least.This film is cheese and cheese on top of more cheese on top of more cheese on top of more cheese............I can keep going all day.............on top of more cheese on top of..... you get the point. I know there is a certain style to his films but this one right from the get go was just plain wrong. This is nothing against the actors in this film who are all desperately doing there best to not laugh with this ludicrous dialogue and the endless stereotypes of the Americans and Japanese........why?Yes i will give the film this, that the CGI and action scenes are visually great and if that is all you want to see I completely understand why you'd love this film. However I believe that the film does in some way try to take itself seriously which it obviously misses by a long long way.Overall I didn't enjoy myself its not good...........its pretty bad 30% out of 100, I simply cant be taken away from the awful clunky dialogue............it sticks out too much for me to not notice it all the time. Great CGI and action but that doesn't make up for it. I would also like to apologise to the film ""Pearl Harbour""..........I'm sorry for being so critical of you all these years saying how cheesy and cliche you are and that you are a bad film........nothing could come possibly close. Well something hasn't come close...........its been overtaken by miles!! Say hello ""Midway"""
Best movie portraying the events of the Midway battle! Special effects were very good and looked so real.
"I will sum up this movie: while aerial-combat (air-ground and air-air, simultaneously), cheesy dialogues between US pilots.
So pretty much the whole movies goes like that."
"MIDWAY is a thrilling cinematic experience! Luke Evans, Patrick Wilson, Ed Skrein, Nick Jonas, Dennis Quaid, Mandy Moore, and Woody Harrelson are all present in one movie. Painstaking research is done for this movie, as it is based on a true story. The movie puts you in the action of sky warfare. This war film perfectly blends action and drama. We experience the thrilling but deadly dogfights and the sorrowful ramifications of casualties on both Americans and Japanese. The panoramic shots of the Pacific Ocean, tactical airplane battles, and the chemistry of the actors are the stars of the show. Wicked action sequences, inspiring heroes, based on a true story, this is a must-watch! #MidwayMovie"
"I went to see this movie first with my school's military history club and then again with my navy veteran grandfather, and we were all very impressed with the historical accuracy, especially in the finer details. However, a movie cannot be built on accuracy alone, and the acting in this movie is also superb. The storytelling is throrough but not dry, and the length of the film is almost perfect, with the film spending adequate time on the Pearl Harbor attack, the Doolittle Raid, and finally Midway, with lots of interlude details in between. There was a brief narrative about Doolittle's escape through China, which was well done but I thought out of place in a movie about a naval battle in the middle of the Pacific. Overall, I highly recommend this movie as a movie to see with a friend, with family, or alone."
"Roland Emmerich takes the action to the Pacific in Midway. When years earlier as Naval attachÃ¨ to Japan, Patrick Wilson's Edwin Layton's advice is ignored by his bosses, and the Japanese had a free shot to take out Pearl Harbor in December 7 1941. And as we know the neutral US then entered WW2. But new Commander of the Fleet Admiral Chester Nimitz, played by Woody Harrelson, is prepared to listen to Layton, the man who tried to warn Washington, and his code-breaking intelligence staff, in the future. Interestingly a band from one of the sunken Pearl Harbor ships increased the code-breaking team. Their knowledge of music useful in identifying patterns in the intel they picked up. Fascinating. And with Brennan Brown's Joseph Rochefort in charge of the code-breaking team, it felt like The Man In The High Castle alumni with Luke Kleintank. This time on the same team.Midway wasn't the beginning of WW2, not for Europe anyway!, and it wasn't the end, but I watched a tv programme a while ago that showed how unprepared the US was at the time. Their torpedoes failing even to blow when hitting a Japanese ship. And Japan had a commanding Naval fleet that dwarfed the US. That would rapidly change over the course of the war. But the US had oil, which the Japanese did not have. And fortunately the Pearl Harbor tankers were not hit.Of the men that will win this battle, Ed Skrein's Dick Best is a maverick in the air. A pilot who practises by cutting off his engine to see if he can still make it. His co-pilot is none too happy about the practise runs! Best's friend was killed at Pearl Harbor and we know he will take his plane to the wire. Much to the chagrin of his superior officer Luke Evans's Wade McCluskey. And Dick's daredevil exploits are what's kept him from promotion. His gutsy dive-bombing will be much needed. And Admiral Nimitz hopes there are more like him when they go after the Japanese Fleet. With pal Clarence Dickinson played by Luke Kleintank, this is an all star cast of sailors and airmen. Dennis Quaid is Admiral William 'Bull' Halsey of the USS Enterprise. I do hope the Star Trek USS Enterprise was named after his ship. And the courageous Nick Jonas as Bruno Gaido, firing a stationary plane's gun at a dive-bombing Japanese plane, to keep his Brothers-in-Arms safe. What a star, and he gets promoted for his services by Halsey. And then walks the plank. All of them heroes and all mentioned at the end of Midway with flying colours.With Midway Island picked up as the Japanese next target by our former tuba players, god love em; to win the battle was crucial for the US, if it were to fall, Hawaii would be next and then the West coast of the US. But back in Tokyo the Japanese are unaware that their messages are being decoded, and the enemy are crossing the Pacific Ocean to be ready for them. But Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, played by Etsushi Toyokawa, we met him at the beginning in peacetime with Layton, knows they have woken the beast that is the USA.I wasn't so sure about the Doolittle Raid on Tokyo led by Aaron Eckhart, the Japanese reprisals against the occupied Chinese seemed too high a price to pay for a few bombs on Tokyo. The end credits said that Nimitz did get to sail into Tokyo Bay on the USS Missouri to accept the Japanese surrender. Far more satisfying.A fun bit of real life trivia was John Ford actually filming at Midway and got more than he could ever have hoped for with his live action filming. And what a feat of engineering when the USS Yorktown holed out after Pearl Harbor, sailed to war in 72 hours. It wasn't just airmen that won this battle.And Roland Emmerich definitely brings the battle to life, and while I wouldn't turn on the tv to watch an old war film, I thought Midway was fantastic. Very exciting with an excellent cast. I'm not going to pretend that it all seemed like a blur at times, because to the guys on the ground it probably was too. War happens at a ferocious pace and I didn't think Emmrich let anything get in the way of telling the story. The CGI special effects were well done and the photography and sound was breathtaking. I cannot recommend Midway highly enough."
"I have found Time after Time to not listen to critics, and once again this has proven to be true. A nice saying about this movie is it is a historical movie that is not try to push a political agenda. It tells a story leading up to and the Battle of Midway. Well worth seeing this movie."
"If you're looking for an exciting movie this one does the job. There's moments you're gonna have so much feelings at the same time. The VFX is not the best but the acting is really great with legends like Woody Harrelson and Dennis Quaid delivering some good boomer humor. It leaves you with a lot to process and learn if you're not aware of all the events before the battle of Midway. Also I'm very glad the movie portrays the suffering and consequences of war from all perspectives, it's always fair that we all acknowledge that."
"Not sure why I see reviews less than 8...this was a great film and the critics are off! Well written, nice to see collaboration between Japan and US on this film.....a lot of junk movies out there....finally one that keeps your eyes glued to the screen from start to finish!"
"I won't rehash what many, many people have already said. It's an excellent reminder of those before us that gave something than the current generations are not capable of doing. The only thought I have would have been to see a little bit about the Aleutian Islands decoy invasion and how the navy went at them the next day but that would have made it a 3 hour movie. I would have gone, I this movie is that good!"
"Wow what a great war movie from the first 10 minutes until the last 5 i was at the edge of my seat,
I also like how there was no real love story and they decided to keep it about the story and less about the woman love interest
and the plane fights were out of this wold to me it almost look very real that even thou cgi was used it didn't feel like it
also the cgi was outstanding and even with so many characters you grow with them through out the only one that compares to this would be saving private Ryan as much as I like that movie this I found better
And unlike pearl harbor 2001 this did that scene way way way better making more engaging I would recommend this to anyone who is a history buff and who likes war movies"
"This movie is a national, heroic, historical, and the most important not have any agenda related to (Bl*ck Race)"
This movie was much better than Pearl Harbor because less of the romance in a war movie. The fight scenes were great and historical event were well done. Not really sure why there would be a bad review of truthful events but I would see this movie again.
"As a WWII History buff, I found this movie entertaining and accurate. The movie ""Pearl Harbor"" pales in comparison. I took my sons to see this movie to learn, and they came home eager to learn more."
"This is an action packed movie from the start and remember, its a war movie! Go find the largest screen you can and take it in."
"If you liked Top Gun, you will like this. A balanced telling of the story of the Battle of Midway, seen from both sides. Fantastic flying sequences and a decent script. If you like planes and are interested in the Pacific war in WW2 then this is worth seeing, on the biggest screen you can."
"I am usually a big fan of war films so I was excited to see Midway and I have to say I really enjoyed the experience of watching this film. The premise of the film sees after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbour a group of US Forces have to predict the Japanese next attack and hit them first. Ed Skrein plays the main character in this film and I thought he did a really good job in the film, usually he has been known as a good supporting actor but he steps up here and I thought did a good job in the lead. I cared about his character and he was a protagonist that was easy to sympathise with along with a huge cast of good performances. Patrick Wilson plays a big character in this film as the head of intelligence and I thought he did a really good job, you just see how the pressure is affecting him throughout the movie and he was an interesting character in this film. Luke Evans is one of my favourite actors and he does a really good job in the film, Skrein and him have some tension in the film but you can tell their is respect there and you do still care about his character. Woody Harrelson and Aaron Eckhart have smaller roles in this film and they both fit their roles well. Alos a shout out to the Japanese actors who do really good work with the material that is given. The story is your usual War film and does a good job of making you care about the American heroes and their plight. However, I felt like for a part the film tries to make this film from a bit of a balanced perspective between the US and Japan but then the film moves away from it and makes the Japanese seem evil and The US as the conquering heroes which I thought was a missed opportunity. The script has some really good drama in it and a nice use of humour to flesh out the characters, I also liked how their was a strong use of Japanese as it actually made sense for the film. The style is visually pretty stunning, the battle scenes look absolutley brilliant and they will keep your eyes on the screen. But I felt like this film had a bit of a pacing issue keeping you fully invested in the whole of the film, including the film going a bit longer then was unneccessary. Overall this is a great tribute to the real life events and a great action film that is worth a watch."
Excellent cinematography. Battlefield described with detail. Hats off to the direction.
"It is so amazing to learn about the history in film!! The fighting scene are so real, fantastic directing. The best part of the film, these characters are true heroes in the war. Love the update of these heroes at the end of the film."
I was incredibly impressed by the attention to detail and historical accuracy. The director proved his knowledge and respect for the source material and all those men who fought and died that day.
"I was Ver happy seeing all my childhood heroes come to life - USS Enterprise , Yorktown etc good balance between the Japanese and American sides . I will watch it again ."
I loved this movie after I saw it lots of Action thank you to all who fought in World War 2 it shows how Allies turned the tide of the war !
"If you like war films I suggest you go and see this.It is an old fashioned film with heroes and great action scenes.It would be easy and pointless to be too critical of this film.If you know the director's work you will know what to expect but it is actually a lot better than you might remember.
He gets good performances from the cast.
The film looks great ,being stationed in Pearl Harbor prior to the attack looks like great fun.There seems to be several historical errors in the films but they are not obvious to most viewers who are not geeks.I do get annoyed when characters say things like INTEL and INCOMING because I am sure nobody used these phrases in 1941.As a British person very interested in WW2 it amazes me that anybody can make a film about the Pearl Harbor attack without mentioning the Royal Navy's attack on the Italian navy in Tatanto harbour in November 1940.The Japanese naval attache in Italy made a full report to the Japanese Navy about the attack and they used the information while planning the Pearl Harbor attack.To sum up then an old fashioned story worth seeing at the cinema."
"Historical films are always difficult to pull off, because history doesn't always fit into a nice Hollywood mold. This is a time period I've always been fascinated by, and Midway is a battle I've read extensively about over the years. So for me, it was important that the story be told accurately, and not munged up with fake characters and story in order to give some star screen time.Is the story accurate? Fundamentally yes. While there was some very minor conflation of supporting events, mostly for time, everything that unfolded is true, and I don't think there is anything shown that flat out did not happen (like in Pearl Harbor).I thought the CGI work overall was excellent. It added to the story in the right way, and it was amazing to see them bring the Enterprise, Hornet, and Yorktown back to life. It was incredible to see those classic Dauntless's, Devastators, Mitchells, Zeros, Kates, and Marauders in the air again. I know some folks will quibble over aircraft insignia and the like, but the story is still intact.I highly recommend seeing this movie. See it for the history, the story, and for the appreciation of the Greatest Generation. One thing that is undeniable, is that those guys had balls the size of coconuts."
"The last movie take on PEARL HARBOR (2001) was largely spoiled by a soapy love story. There's only one wife featured in Midway and she's just there as a token Woman Who Waits For Her Husband's Return. What Roland Emmerich gives us this time is a solid chunk of naval history, superbly illustrated by the GGI effects he used so thrillingly in INDEPENDENCE DAY and THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW.With lengthy scenes of both the Japanese and American battle planning, the movie shows how the Japanese superiority after the 'infamous' damage they inflicted on the US navy at Pearl Harbor was overcome, mostly thanks to radio intercepts and code-breaking by the guys at Naval Intelligence (sorry, ladies).Back stories are minimal, in keeping with the documentary style of the film. Woody Harrelson and Randy Quaid give un-showy performances as key admirals and all the fighter pilots play as a team, much as they would have in wartime, with nobody pushing for extra screen time. Good to see Luke Evans on solid form; he reminds me increasingly of the young Richard Harris, and I hope he has an equally substantial career ahead of him.The CGI bombing at Pearl Harbor and out in the Pacific is nothing less than awesome. Here and there the aerial combat scenes (and camera-shots behind ordnance) give off a PlayStation flavor, but overall MIDWAY does eloquent justice to a turning-point moment in 20th-century history."
"Tense, gripping drama based on actual events.This movie follows the Battle of Midway from both the American perspective, and from the Japanese Navy side, how the Americans overcame incredible odds, and how this was a critical turning point in ww2.I kept thinking the dilemma youngsters' face nowadays is no more than 'should I get a Samsung or an Apple', and 'where's my safe space'.Compare that with what the typical ww2 youngsters were facing, 'will I survive this bombing raid!', or 'will I manage to pull out from this aerial dive!'Amazing special effects. Also amazingly a 12A certificate in UK, so thankfully kids could watch. See actual photos of the heroes during the end credits. The lack of the nuclear strikes stopped me awarding a maximum 10, but still highly recommended."
"Student of history here and one who is familiar with much World War II, having built the Nichimo 1:200 Yamato (for the second time) last year. The books, Lord and Prange, are the Bibles of the battle and this film took pages and turned to screen intact and with respect. Harrelson was amazingly good as Nimitz too, did not think he had it in him. The rest of the cast - some well known, Quaid and Eckhart, and others new worked excellently ..... and the Japanese view was square solid too. Special Effects , CGI of course - were on par with the best though the Japanese films THE ETERNAL ZERO and THE ADMIRAL are just as good. Recommend these two films for a solid trio. We do not go back to the emotional slop of PEARL HARBOR or the accurate and very very dull TORA of so many years ago. But the one rare film where people CLAP at the end of it and sometimes you want cheer. Waves the flag without politics. A time and people to be proud of and render honor to. This film does precisely that."
"Just saw Midway. Costume designers failed on men wearing the Navy uniforms.Most don't fit and looked wrinkled with pocket flaps turned up. None of them would ever pass inspection. However, the Japanese uniforms looked perfect. What gives?"
Why it only has 6.2  puzzles me. It should be at 10. It's a Great True Story. Great acting great filming and great direction.
"When I heard a Midway movie was being made I could barely contain my excitement, when I heard Emmerich was directing it I started to control my expectations. However, this movie surprised me in a very good way. While the characters are a bit flat and Hollywood does indeed come through here and there, the pros heavily outweigh the cons. The movie is historically accurate, and does very well in capturing the defining moments leading up to, and during the battle of Midway. What shocked me the most though was how tragically beautiful this movie was. Emmerich gets very creative with his shots, especially during the battle sequences, and it pays of massively. If you would have told me before I saw this movie that it's one of the most hauntingly beautiful war movies I've ever seen I probably would have laughed in your face, but it is. This is without a doubt a movie worth seeing, and a must see if you're anything of a history nerd. This is definitely a film you should see on the big screen to get the full experience."
"What makes this a good war movie are the action sequences which gives the viewer a realistic sense of the suicidal horror of air combat and the bravery of those engaged in it. Overall, the acting was solid and the script moved at a brisk pace. I probably would've focused more on the intelligence angle as I believed the pilots were a bit hammy in their performances at times. The balance with the Japanese forces was interesting and gave a perspective of the battle that reinforced its importance to both sides. Excellent choice for Veterans Day."
"Great film if you like war type films, some great action scenes & a decent story, it is definitely worth watching as I enjoyed it but don't expect a film like Pearl Harbor as it was nowhere near as good but still stood on it's own."
"I left entertained and I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. I plan on seeing it again tomorrow as well as this weekend.I think people do not know the difference between a ""documentary"" and ""based on a true story"". There are things that were glossed over or exaggerated but for the most part, pretty close to the actual events. I thought the action scenes were well done as well as the acting. There is one scene that felt a bit cheesy (not sure if it's the same scene people seem to be upset with) but it's a movie, not that big of deal.
My one issue is that some points of interest in the movie could have been elaborated more. If someone is going into this not knowing a lot of the battle, I can see why you may be confused. Overall, if you are a WWII guy, definitely a must see."
"Historians classify the battle of Midway in 1942 as the turning point of World War II in the Pacific. Since invading Manchuria in 1931, the Japanese had been on a roll. This runaway success lost momentum on June 7th, just six months after their surprise attack on December 7th devastated Pearl Harbor. The earliest movie about Midway appeared in September 1942. Renowned Hollywood director John Ford lensed battlefield footage of the Midway attack for an 18-minute documentary. Indeed, Ford filmed the bombs as they fell! Later, director Henry Hathaway's ""Wing and A Prayer"" (1944) was the first Hollywood feature-length film about this landmark battle. Audiences would have to wait until 1976, when Universal Pictures released director Jack Smight's ""Midway,"" starring Charlton Heston, Henry Fonda, James Coburn, and Glenn Ford to commemorate this extraordinary victory. Ironically, German director Roland Emmerich's ""Midway"" qualifies as the best version of the battle. Apart from Ford's documentary, no movie about the Midway victory has bristled with the amount of historical content as Emmerich's film. Mind you, no movie can ever claim to be 100 percent authentic. For example, the U.S. carrier-based planes were the wrong color, and the decks of Japanese flattops weren't painted the color yellow. Nevertheless, Emmerich's epic clearly tops anything done about this Japanese defeat. Every character is based on an actual individual. Virtually every line of dialogue contains material about the battle. Hampered by an inadequate budget, Emmerich and freshman scenarist Wes Tooke have done a commendable job of depicting the clash from both American and Japanese perspectives.Unfortunately, this ambitious depiction is as comprehensive as most armchair admirals would probably prefer. Of course, money dictates everything in Hollywood. Reportedly, the most expensive independent film in history, ""Midway"" boasted a budget of a $100 million, but it wasn't adequate to cover the whole fracas. Comparably, ""Midway"" (1976) relied chiefly on recycled war movie footage and vintage newsreels spliced into star-studded command post scenes to recreate a fight which Universal Pictures could hardly have afforded on its relatively modest budget. Meantime, Emmerich's dramatization created authentic-looking, computer-generated imagery to immortalize this seemingly implausible American triumph. Three U.S. Navy aircraft carriers participated at Midway. Emmerich concentrates on the U.S.S. Hornet and the U.S.S. Enterprise, but he relegates the U.S.S. Yorktown to the periphery. Furthermore, the film omits one of Midway's greatest heroes: Lieutenant Commander John C. Waldron, who led a squadron of 15 Douglas TBD-1 Devastator torpedo planes from the Hornet. Tragically, the Japanese slaughtered Waldron's squadron. One of Waldron's fliers--Ensign George Gay--survived this catastrophe. Ditching in the ocean, Gay had a ringside seat to watch his compatriots sink a Japanese aircraft carrier.In ""Midway,"" Emmerich intersperses scenes of the codebreakers at Pearl Harbor with scenes aboard the aircraft carriers Hornet and Enterprise. After the debacle of Pearl Harbor, President Roosevelt orders Admiral Chester Nimitz (Woody Harrelson of ""Zombieland"") to destroy the Japanese Imperial Navy and take the U.S. Navy into Tokyo Bay. Nimitz relies on Lieutenant Commander Edwin T. Layton (Patrick Wilson of ""The Conjuring"") and Navy Intelligence cryptologists. They intercepted enemy radio messages and then predicted where they thought the Japanese might strike. Meantime, the film shifts from war councils to a rivalry between Navy aviators Wade McClusky (Luke Evans of ""Dracula Untold"") and Richard 'Dick' Best (Ed Skrein of ""Deadpool""), who commanded two bomb squadrons. Back at Pearl Harbor, Best's wife Ana (Mandy Moore of ""47 Meters Down"") worries about her husband.Otherwise, ""Midway"" ranks as an old-fashioned World War II epic like ""The Longest Day"" (1962), the D-Day classic featuring a star-studded cast headlined by John Wayne. The battle of Midway is reminiscent of the desperate attack on the Death Star in George Lucas' classic sci-fi saga ""Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope"" (1977). Lucas patterned ""Star Wars"" in some respects on several World War II era battles. At the time of this Pacific War battle, the U.S. Navy was struggling for survival against a clearly superior enemy that had out-numbered, out-gunned, and out-fought them. If you reviewed the battle on paper, the Japanese enjoyed an overwhelming edge. The Japanese were forged in fire and seasoned by experience, something their American adversaries lacked. Our planes couldn't match the legendary Japanese Zero fighter planes. These Zeroes descended in swarms onto the American pilots and shot them to ribbons. Just as Pearl Harbor had been a military intelligence failure for America, the Japanese underestimated not only the American fighting spirit but also our unwillingness to capitulate. Early in ""Midway,"" Japanese Admiral Yamamoto describes the U.S. as ""a sleeping giant"" waiting to be awakened. Yamamoto knew Japan couldn't survive a drawn-out war with America and its industrial superiority. Therefore, he planned Midway as a stroke to destroy what remained of the U.S. Navy fleet anchored at Pearl Harbor.Unlike ""Midway"" (1976), Emmerich and Took have put the famous battle into the context of World War II. Layton chats with Yamamoto before the Japanese created the ""Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere."" Later, the Japanese attack Pearl Harbor without warning and sink the battleship U.S.S. Arizona. Best loses a beloved Annapolis roommate. Meanwhile, Admiral William F. Halsey (Dennis Quaid of ""Wyatt Earp""), suffers from a mysterious skin ailment, and Nimitz packs him off to the hospital. He replaces Halsey with Admiral Raymond Spruance (Jake Webber of ""Meet Joe Black"") who distinguishes himself, despite his lack of knowledge about aircraft carriers. The combat aerial scenes are breathtaking, especially when we are looking over a tail assembly of an American SBD Dauntless dive bomber before it plunges from several thousand feet to bomb a Japanese carrier. Clocking in at two hours and 18 minutes, ""Midway"" teems with fascinating details. For example, U.S. torpedoes were unreliable. Often, they bounced harmlessly off the hulls of Japanese ships without exploding. War movie buffs, military veterans, and historians are going to salute ""Midway"" for its factual approach and its meticulous reenactment."
"I was immediately drawn to this movie from the trailer. I like war movies. I love learning about events that happened that I was never taught or mentioned in school. Furthermore, I love to learn about events on that side of the world(not just with America but with things that happened in China/Japan/Indonesia and so on that we're never taught in the west).One of the more notable things to mention about this movie is how it's not politically driven. The director/writers set out to make a re-enactment of an event that not many people know about unless you're in the military. I'll admit that some of the character stories aren't the most interesting but there had to be something there to get the audience interested and to propel the movie along.Unlike some of the other war movies, I like how this movie tied the opposing side in. Usually we hear and see it from one side(America's side). It's critical that when we learn about history that we learn about all sides and perspectives.If you like war movies, you'll love this movie. It doesn't waste anytime ramping up the action. They even include(while very little) some of the Japanese invasion of China in this movie. Can the West please start giving us some films about history in the East? ... because we definitely aren't going to be taught about it in school.We all obviously know how WW2 turned out but this movie gave me the feeling that it really could've went either way. Both sides in this movie were making strategic moves without GPS and many other things.Definitely see this movie if you like these kinds of movies."
"Although there already exists a film about this battle, released in 1976 starring Charlton Heston and Henry Fonda, the new one is actually better. All the major characters in the new film are historical, whereas the character played by Heston is fictional, and the earlier film has a totally unnecessary inter-racial romantic sub-plot. The old film began by showing the Doolittle raid, but the new one starts in Japan in 1937 at a dinner party hosted by Admiral Yamamoto (Etsushi Toyokawa) and attended by Assistant Naval Attache Lieutenant-Commander Edwin Layton (Patrick Wilson) in which they discuss the possibility of a war between their two countries. It then fast forwards to the attack on Pearl Harbor and the Doolittle raid. (Doolittle himself is played by Aaron Eckhart.) The film actually focuses on Navy pilot Lieutenant Dick Best (Ed Skrein), who was one of the dive bombers who took out the Japanese aircraft carriers during the battle, and his wife Ann (Mandy Moore). Admirals Halsey and Nimitz are played by Dennis Quaid and Woody Harrelson, respectively, but Admiral Spruance (Jake Weber), who actually commanded the U.S. Navy forces during the battle, is given a rather short shrift. Of course, in the original film they actually had to fly real planes and use models to represent ships, but now they can use CGI, which is excellent. On the other hand, the characterizations seemed clichÃ©d, and the film makers felt obligated to insert frequent info dumps."
"Midway is an above average war film that surprisingly gives a balanced account from both sides. Patrick Wilson, Woody Harrelson and Luke Evans give really good performances. The music by Harald Kloser and Thomas Wanker is excellent and there are genuinely thrilling moments in the third act. What brings it down is the CG, which whilst good enough for the most part has moments of looking bad and cheap throughout, as well as Ed Skrein's weak performance and awful accent. Still much better than Michael Bay's Pearl Harbor."
Commonly I avoid to watch war and history type movie.. but after watching this really impress me.
"I like movies with a bit of history, and this delivers. The CGI is not massively overbearing, and you get the Japanese side as well. The two flaws are the main character. This is a real person, but it was so gung ho that if it had been a woman we would have all been complaining about another Mary Sue. But he did achieve what is portrayed in the film, so maybe it is the fault of the second flaw - the dialogue. Its so clunky I'm surprised it didn't sink the ships. In the end I started watching the film for the editing, the lighting and the sound, all of which are excellent. So if you are interested in the art of film making , this is also worth a watch."
"Not perfect but good and intense storyteling of important second world war events. Some cliches, some second rate animations but all In all this is a movie worth seeing."
Wow what an amazing film definitely go to the cinemas and go watch it ðð!!!!
"I will give this a 7 as a big compliment to the tech crew behind this movie. The visuals are amazing! You can't say the same for Ed Skrein. Bad and lame acting. He tried but failed miserably. I really don't understand what they see in this guy. Anyway, I think everything else aside from the bad actors' performances was pretty good although I prefer Pearl Harbor by a long shot."
"This IMHO is a much better outing in so far as covering the actual battle as apposed to Pearl Harbor. That being said it glossed over so much of the meat and bones of the battle in favor of added drama, (love store and such). I'm not against such things just not a fan of covering a half a year on a 1 day battle. While Layton's arc is excusable as the code breakers journey. The motivation for the Enterprise pilots could have been done in flashbacks as opposed to a nearly full retelling of Pearl Harbor yet again. The Doolittle Raid did motivate the Japanese to push for an engagement that would expose our Air craft Carriers but again to much time wasted on ANOTHER Battle. All that aside I liked the movie and it's cast immensely and thought some of the revelations quite interesting. The special effects while generally good IMHO could have been better. They were to clean and glossy they lacked a tactile feel of having been real. While I can recommend this film as fun just don't expect high art or a sense of wow after the fact."
"The action sequences and cinematography were excellent. The writing... not so much.
I appreciate the effort to remain accurate. However, the dialogue was cringey and not a reflection of how actual people talk. It made it hard to really build a connection with the characters.
I've heard others say that this should have been a series; to allow more time to tell the story. I can't say I disagree because it definitely felt rushed.
Overall I liked it. It's not going to win any Oscars, but you'll have a good time."
"Midway.... an entertaining film. I did enjoy learning about the famous battle and the courage of the soldiers who put their lives on the line. Movie was pretty well done... although the script seemed pretty weak with a lot of the dialogue sounded cheesy.I also felt that the pacing of the movie was off. Things just felt rushed. Sections that were big parts of the movie just were done so quickly. The film just felt like it was rushing and we were never let to feel the moment or power of a scene. It was just rushed on to the next scene.The score was pretty boring. For such an important event.. the music and score is so important. I felt the score was not good and didn't help the movie very much.Movie could have been a lot better with better attention to the script, better editing and score. The actors were doing the best with what they were given."
"If there's one thing Hollywood does well is CGI. I wanted to see Midway because I thought that after 43 years they would've figured out a way to explain the story better than the 1976 version, but they didn't. The screenplay was pretty close the original with the ""enhancements "" of super realistic battle scenes and a love story (required in all Reenactment films now). Maybe I'm just not bright enough to understand the complexity of this critical WWII battle, or maybe they couldn't figure out how to tell it clearly in 2 hours."
"Some cringy acting and a script that could have been better...seems like the actors are dull. Another point is it doesnt have a consistent and fluid story...it jumps around to much to cover aspects outside of Midway...with the actual focus on Midway being towards the last 30 mins of the film...its like they didnt know what to do so they filled in more parts outside the main premise of the movie to add time to it. Also why is a Chinese company in control of a film like this?...It had the potential to be great but just turned out average...not bad but not great. I would say it's worth seeing. Just sad to see an overuse of obvious CGI, dull acting, and cringy dialogue at some points. A Chinese owned film company isn't going to do justice to distinguish the sacrifice of American armed forces during WW2. Pearl Harbor is a better movie."
"I should not add any justification to this $chlock's existence, but since Hollyweird created it I feel compelled, so here goes. I don't know when the producers, directors, screen geniuses in Tarnished Tinsel Town are going to figure out that they have no talent whatsoever for historical dramas of this nature, but I hope it occurs in the next 1,000 year or so. Anyway, this film is everything I expected: Typical, Boring, Lame, Formulaic Tripe . . . and the cast, the plotting, and the dialogue can only be described as Terrible. But hey, what do I know? People are bored, and $chlock sells. Bottom line: You'd be better off watching one of the YouBoob video documentaries on this event and spending the money on lottery tickets!"
So why would you dedicate it to Japanese soldiers? They were just as bad if not worse than than the Nazis on so many level. Why America finds it necessary to treat the Japanese empire with respect is beyond me.
"I only watched the trailer (so far) and i'm not very impressed with the cgi. The models aren't the problem it's the physics and the lightning that make it look bad. I know you should never judge a book by its cover and that's the same for a trailer of the movie. I'm gonna watch the movie and see how it is, maybe the story is great if so i will let the overuse and mistakes of the cgi slip."
"Great action scenes, good timeline not to long or too short. On the whole good performances by the cast. The only thing I found missing was an emotional connection to make it epic. The film was perhaps a little to centred around dickie to few true upset for many of the other characters passing throughout. As an action though the best war film in a while could have tweaked the drama and emotion a little more on top of this though."
"This could have been and epic movie, with some great action sequences and out of this world CGI effects. But SADLY its NOT!!! Ronald Emrich picked up the most complex war world 2 battle to make a movie with and have disappointed. The story did not have a connection of what is happening when apart from the citations on the screen with dates each time letting us know the time frame of the battles. The characters were poorly built and did not make any impact on the audience. So when someone died the audience did not feel for that person as they never connected. Poor use of CGI made it even worse where you can actually tell the things in the background are not close to real. Lot of action sequences but not connected to each other at all. There was no suspense building around the war as everything kind of fell apart. There were more american planes that went down in the movie and still somehow we managed a victory. The sense of pride was missing, all the characters somehow just did their part and went home. This was not even close to Pearl Harbor let alone Saving Private Ryan. Truly disappointed and out of words."
"Wow! The greatest sea battle movie ever made. Can't understand how anyone could complain about anything. Being extremely familiar with the history of events, I didn't expect Hollywood to come close to accuracy, but I was pleasantly surprised. Acting and SFX were as good as it gets. Before seeing the movie, I had read a few complaints about the CG. Now I'm wondering why? The special effects were truly excellent, never seen better. No film before has ever provided a movie-goer with such a realistic naval aviator perpective of attacking an enemy ship. The movie highlights the complexity of war, the risks, importance of military intelligence, and the heroic actions of the American military. No movie is perfect, but this is as close as it gets. I see plenty of pointless, fictional, meaningless movies--some are enjoyable to watch (especially sci-fi), but they are no comparison to the real-life story of Midway, which will go down as one of the greatest war movies ever made. See it now on the big screen! And celebrate the warriors who turned the tide of war in the Pacific in 1943!"
"Such a great movie, story, and tribute to an epic battle in history. Well done. Extremely entertaining."
The story of Battle of Midway during the World War II in 1942 has been very effectively conveyed on the big screen this time by Roland Emmerich. He is back again lifting up a few notches higher from his recent films nearly back to his best.The graphics have been used very well and apt to the storyline. Film's screenplay is tight holding the audience throughout the length of the film. Its a very good war film without pushing all the nationalistic feelings that some others have done in the past giving a fairly balanced view from both American and Japanese perspective.Ed Skrein and Patrick Wilson have portrayed very well and so has Nick Jonas.Well worth watching this one.
"Unlike many productions from Hollywood now days, this movie stuck to the facts. It probably did a better telling of the story than the 1976 version of ""Midway"". The actors and Director deserve a big congratulation on this production. It is well worth watching and learning about this pivotal Battle of World War II, often considered one of six most important naval battles in history.Their interpretation of the men and women who fought and lived through this event was very well done. There were no hollywood prima donnas among the actors or their protral of the real men and women who lived this event. Unlike Hollywood's previous retelling of a crucial battle in World War II (""Pearl Harbor"" which was a poor attempt of remaking ""Tora! Tora! Tora!"") this movie did not try to romanticize the story, but to tell it in a factual way.This movie is well worth watching. You can actually learn from it."
"This movie obviously wasn't the greatest war film ever. It's a very stylish and action driven film. It wants to entertain you, and it will if you let it. A lot of reviews are angry that it's an unnecessary remake, but really the first Midway from the 1970's really isn't that great. Don't act like it's some kind of untouchable masterpiece. I'd go as far as to say I'd rather watch this version because it's at least more fun to watch. Then again, I didn't walk into this movie expecting an amazing deep movie. I came to see a dramatic retelling of a famous battle and to be entertained. And in the end that's what you get. If you're looking for the most accurate depiction of Midway go read about it."
"All things considered, this was a pretty good genre flick. The story was elementary, men in war. With not a lot of needless psychiatric expose, Basic in the ""guys caught in a maelstrom, with no choice but to do as they're trained to do""vein. Not a lot of soul searching or wrestling with the deadly, dangerous task at hand. If you're looking for ""Platoon"" keep looking. This is more in the vein of ""Private Ryan"" without the nervous tremors.The dialog for the most part exists only to advance the story. Some of the dialogue is reduced to period piece, Gung Ho, rubbish, but it's not important to the narrative.The effects were adequate for the settings. There is the slight feel of computer combat flight sim to much of it. A lot of exploding airplanes and ships and a blizzard of anti-aircraft fire. A cacophony of explosions. Perhaps a little overcooked, but, hey, it's Hollywood and everyone was having fun.The cast was interesting. Harrelson was adequate as Nimitz as was Quaid as Halsey. Neither had a big stretch to make. Patrick Wilson as Ed Layton was underwhelming. Frankly, I thought he was not nerdy enough for his role. The rest of the cast did their part. The story was the star in this picture. Except for Ed Skrein, who absolutely nailed the role of Dick Best. A lot has been said about his accent with some of the Corporate critics calling him out for his ""Jersey"" accent. Let me tell you, the accent was absolutely perfect. Perfect to a point where, being a native of New Jersey, I guessed the location of Best's actual home within 10 miles, only on the basis of Skrein's acting. Best was from Bayonne, NJ, but I didn't know that until I looked it up, I had guessed Newark. And then to learn Skrien is a Brit, well, Bravo, sir, well done."
"Horrendously done picture.
Disrespectful of the era, disrespectful of the events and most importantly -- disrespectful of the living participants of the events"
"The Battle of Midway was a clash between the American fleet and the Imperial Japanese Navy which marked a pivotal turning point in the Pacific during WWII.When you see that a film is directed by the man who bought us Independence Day and White House Down, you know that the film isn't going to be very subtle, or have the greatest script in the world.But at least it could pass two hours without causing too much concern.And this is what the film exactly is, nothing to be too concerned about. It tries to compete with other WWII films released in the past 20 years, but emulates them, rather than try to supersede them, which in all fairness, is a plus point with this film.What we have is your token WWII characters we have seen depicted on film since the fifties, melded with CGI that isn't too bad, but nothing we haven't seen before.It's not saying much, but Skrein has never been this good in a film before (just besting 'If Beale Street Could Talk' but he's only in that for a hot minute), as the central character, Dick Best (insert joke here.....).He's the Maverick of the film, a misunderstood cowboy who grumbles at rules, and then listens to them begrudgingly, we've all seen this character a thousand times before, and you can see what his outcome will be from a periscope.Then we have Harrelson, in his most restraint role ever, he may as well be wearing a stars and stripes suit, he is the epitome of flag waving, just call him Mr. All American.Wilson has the sixth sense with the bloke who played Mr. Dresden in the orange Wednesday adverts. Ten years ago, this would have been played by Kevin Spacey, and the role would have been so much meatier. But Wilson is quite watchable whenever he is on screen.Eckhart pops in for a couple of minutes as the hard as nails Doolittle, and like his characters name, he has very little to do, other than land a plane, and run off.Evans is the Iceman to Skreins Maverick, and although Evans is good, in the actual film, his character is given little to do.Then there is the star of the show, Dennis Quaid, who literally grizzles and chew scenery whenever he appears. He is hilarious for all the wrong reasons, and clearly awful, but I couldn't help but get excited whenever he appeared on screen.As for the rest of the film, it's just your atypical 'people discussing tactics around a table film, intercut with familiar action set pieces'.It's not a terrible film by any means, there is just no cause for concern with this film, and unlike WWII, it's pretty harmless."
"Like other reviewers already pointed out this movie is more like a documentary in cinematic style, its entertaining enough for a one-time watch but after i left the cinema i didnt had the urge to spent another thought on it. It has some great actionscenes and some not so great actionscenes, the pearlharbor-movie from 2001 in many regards looks still better than this. If you have nothing better to do this movie is okay to kill some time but its definetly not a must-see."
"Absolute garbage.,Just like video game, ,Cheesy dialogue ,bland characters.thats all I have to say."
Useless 2 hours film that only focuses on an America- Japan war during WW2. You'll be yawning though out the film duration.
"The scores in here make me laugh sometimes. 10/10? 9/10? It's not even a 5!!
ClichÃ©d in every way. Awful script (that's being kind). Caricatures of Characters. Has anyone heard the term ""Show don't tell""? Geez Austin Powers' Basil Exposition wouldn't get a part in this movie for being too vague.
For all those that did enjoy this tripe I'd like to apologise for using so many big French words."
"Awful graphics, uninspiring and dull dialogue, over the top action sequences, skimmed over 3 major Pacific battles when it should've focused on just Midway (hey that's why the movie's called Midway right?) Only redeeming feature is that it's mostly historically accurate. Wait to stream this movie."
If you wanted a movie about what the Japanese did to America and the horrors they perpetrated ... that the Japanese would like then this is your movie! Horrible. Acting was average script was disjointed and sometimes pointless. Movie starts with blaming the USA for causing Pearl Harbor! Without CGI there is no movie and the CGI was not really that good.
"Movies take a lot of work to get right. High quality writing can be undermined by poor acting. Conversely, poor writing can hamstring otherwise good performances.Rarely do those two things complement one another as perfectly as the do in Midway.Both writing and acting were so bad that they somehow worked as a force multiplier on each other. The combined effect in this movie yielded a maelstrom of suck that was so powerful we could feel wind rushing in beneath the theater doors.This movie was about genuine American heroes from the greatest generation and I am grateful for them. The studio probably assumed patriotism would be enough to keep this vessel afloat but it just wasn't good enough.Lots of cool 'splosions and stuff but even they weren't enough to right this ship. Watch it streaming if included in your entertainment package but don't go out of your way beyond that."
I went to this movie yesterday and it was just about what I expected. The special effects were over the top but it missed the mark on the details. They could have spent a few bucks on a real Navy technical advisor. The navy of the mid part of last century was much different than it is today. Enlisted people were not allowed to socialize with officers. In the Navy you always wear something on your head is you are outdoors and take it off when indoors. Smoking is not allowed on the flight line. The flick is awash with goofs like this. In all the movie is pretty good but I liked the 76 version much better. I guess I'm just an ole salt that believes in the Old Navy.
"So we all know about the heroes of world war 2.
We all heard about the valor of combat and how many lives where lost.
War was bad for all sides in wartime. A war fueled by a few individual madmen with dreams about ruling the world.In a historical moment in time where the battle for the pacific turned tide into the favor of allied forces vs the axis.
Did you ever hear about soldiers, marines, pilots go to war without fear in their hearts and talking to their brothers in arms about it?
This movie seems to counter all possible realistic emotion with Gung-Ho GI-Joe arrogant bravado and bullet proof invisible shields with 1000's of 50 cal bullets zipping past their flight trajectory.How can you possible mess this up so bad with such a scala of great actors by giving them a shallow script which makes a serious historical part of humanity look like i'ts ment to be and cool?Stop putting bad information into people's brains by changing historical facts with lame movies while fueling your war propaganda machine.
Because that's all that this movie seems to be good for.That's all i have to say about this flick.Story: Lame, shallow, unrealistic.
Music: Nothing special.
Sound FX: Good but lacked some 7.1 depth.
Choreography: Great
Directing: Good
Screenplay: Lame, predictable overacting with stereotype roles."
"Let's start with the good stuff - the cgi and POV action shots were amazing .The bad stuff - the script was awful :( the main protagonist was a stereotypical American hero but it was an annoying characterisation and rather being drawn to the character you end up disliking the character altogether.For a chinese financed film there was little mention of the shocking 11 million deaths as a result of WW2 at the hands of the Japanese. It did mention the 250,000 killed for helping the American army pilots escape .Was it better than the most recent Pearl Harbour film ? YesWhat was enlightening was that the film was dedicated to both sides who fought at midway both the Americans and Japanese and like Tora! Tora! It attempted to show both sides . It gave sympathy to those who die for ones country whether that country acts right or wrong .Is it worth watching ? - YesDon't expect too muchPad.A 5/10"
"Last line on the screen before the credits ""This film is dedicated to the American and Japanese soldiers who fought at Midway"" WHAT? You mean the ones that killed many of our servicemen in Pearl Harbor? Or the number of American soldiers killed in the South Pacific during this same war? Or was it the ones that tortured and killed innocents during this same war? What about the one they showed in this movie where a Japanese commander tied an anchor around an American soldier and threw him overboard to drown? Those soldiers?Film is entertaining but dishonoring Americans that gave their lives for our freedoms is NOT ok.Oh and for good measure....Woody Harrelson as Admiral Nimitz? I like Woody in some of his parts but this is WAY off base. Not good.Gave it 5 start for entertainment value but a 0 for everything else. Roland Emmerich needs to stick to movies like The day after tomorrow or 2012."
"For a movie with a lot of action, I was a little bored.This is helmed by disaster movie director Roland Emmerich. He is a guy who found his voice in the 90's, and this movie kind of feels like it was made during that decade. The execution is too light for its own good. I don't mean this in a complimentary way. Dialogue is undercooked and at times cliched. I felt like a lot of good actors were wasted here. There is a lot of quick jumping from scene-to-scene. Yes, I know this is one of those war movies that look at many players, but even by the standards of these types of films, the scenes often don't hold weight.Also, this movie feels kind of odd for today. More recent war movies have tried to look at the more realistic and darker elements of the subject and the human toll and psychology of it all. Not that this movie isn't about human sacrifice, but this tries to be more of a crowdpleaser like the war films of yesteryear. It feels out of place in today's climate.Of course, I could just be jaded. If you want to see movie honoring those who died for our county, then this might be for you. The movie does a good job of laying out how the battle of Midway went down on both the American and Japanese fronts and evoking the old feel of wide-scale military battle films.Emmerich maintains his eye for action. The combat scenes are all done well. The computer graphics aren't the best; none of them look realistic enough. In Emmerich's defense, I give him credit for showing a lot of them during full daylight scenes, which is trickier than doing them during night or in grey/blue lighting. Also, props to hair and costumes in this.Overall, this is a movie that looks good enough but just doesn't stand out."
What better way to make a film celebrating the Americans victory at midway.But unfortunately this film repeats dive bombing like it's a dominoes pizza.

"Midway is not just the name of the place where a historic WWII sea battle took place between the Americans and the Japanese, it's also the point in this film where I realised I didn't know what was going on. Director Roland Emmerich (Godzilla, Independence Day, 2012) is obviously no slouch when it comes to action scenes, bringing us some truly astonishing battle sequences that provide much bang for your buck, but he struggles to tell his complex historical story with any coherence.As the movie cuts back and forth between the American and Japanese forces, with numerous ships, locations, characters, and much detailed wartime strategy to take in, it's easy to lose track of what's what and, more importantly, who is who, making it hard to feel anything when they meet their inevitable fate in a ball of flames and twisted metal (the most emotional part of the whole film comes right at the end when photos with captions show the real-life people who were instrumental in the battle).Of course, those who are watching, not for a history lesson or for heart-rending pathos, but for thrilling scenes of destruction and derring-do, are more than catered for with countless huge explosions, plenty of machine-gun fire and loads of impressive aerial combat. While most of this is realised through the use of CGI, it's well-handled and, for the most part, very convincing.5.5/10, rounded up to 6 for IMDb."
"Midway is a remake of the 1976 film of the same name. The film is directed by Roland Emmerich, the director of Independence Day and The Day After Tomorrow.In the film, the US Navy in Pearl Harbor has been attacked by Japan. Japan thought it had sunk the entire fleet, but the remaining aircraft carriers decided to take revenge on Japanese troops with a surprise attack. For this they need to locate the enemy forces without getting noticed. The Navy knows how to locate the Japanese around the Midway Island in the Pacific. Now, with espionage and war tactics, they have to outsmart the larger group of Japanese with their surprise attack. This is how the battle of Midway begins.This film is about famous events from the Second World War around the attack on Pearl Harbor. This event has previously been filmed in the original film from 1976 and in 2001 in the Pearl Harbor film directed by Michael Bay. Michael Bay unfortunately chose to fill his film with his own fictional version and a triangular relationship. Although he filled this film with a fictional and long-winded story, he managed to put in credible and entertaining action scenes with explosions. Roland Emmerich also tries to do this with this film only without the success that Michael Bay had. In Midway, both navy fleets always try to sink each other with surprise attacks. The problem is that as a viewer you get to see the scenes in which both navy fleets plan their surprise attacks and this only remains a surprise for the film characters. This makes the film a kind of predictable naval battle game for viewers and especially for viewers who are familiar with the history of this battle. After the umpteenth planning and attack scene, the film also feels a little repeatedly what makes the film more predictable and thus a bit more elaborate.Michael Bay managed to fill his film with exaggerated but credible explosions that he is familiar with. In his older films such as Independence Day, Roland Emmerich managed to make the explosions in the film more credible than he does nowadays in his films. He now chooses to place this in a more technical way in his films with CGI and a green screen.The cast consists of a group of famous actors such as Patrick Wilson, Luke Evans, Mandy Moore and Woody Harrelson. The problem is that most of their characters have not really been worked out, making it difficult for them to keep track of who exactly is and what he is doing during the film. Most characters you only recognize by the face of the actor who plays the character."
"There are war movies and there are war movies. Some say not to listen to the critics for this one. I should have listened to the critics (they watch a lot of movies and know what quality a movie could have been, instead of what it is - they're the connaisseurs). This movie has too many characters, a haphazard storyline, no character depth whatsoever and does not leave one with a feeling of awe, as good war movies should do. I had already forgotten about it as soon as I left the cinema. What does this movie have? A lot of well-known actors. A lot of actors. Actors with perfectly combed hair, even in the midst of battle. A lof of CGI. Dramatic music (which always enhances the movie: if it is a good movie, it becomes a great one, if it is a mediocre movie, it becomes even worse). What doesn't this movie have? Depth. A storyline that takes you into the story. A sense of identification with the characters. A sense of the reality of war. If you're looking for chewing gum chewing, too cool to be real soldiers, who perform superman like stunts and still survive, watch this movie. If you want many superficial characters, watch it. But if you want a story that takes you somewhere, leaves you baffled, AND has the visuals and music that amplify that story, watch Saving Private Ryan, Hacksaw Ridge, Black Hawk Down or even Dunkirk (a great less = more movie). But this movie is a disgrace to war movies and great storytelling."
"This movie looks absolutely stunning, but that's about it.
The writing is just very mediocre, the script consists of almost every movie clichÃ© and a million one-liners. The movie doesn't make you care for any the characters, so you'll feel nothing when some of them die.
This is also due the the acting being not so great overall.The writers tried to put way to many events in this movie. Most of the battle scenes have a very bad build up in terms of suspense and feel rushed.
They should've focussed on less action scenes so they could actually build up the tension more and let us care more for the characters."
"It is funny that they portray the filmmaker John Ford in this film. He was once quoted ""Never let the facts stand in the way of a good movie."" I didn't find this movie good or factual.I applaud the effort by Hollywood to make a film that honors the veterans of World War 2. However, they should have consulted some historians on this film."
"Roland Emmerich is not a name that inspires much faith for historical accuracy, but hey the Patriot was at least entertaining.This is not the Patriot.I noticed they were getting details wrong so I turned my brain off and just tried to enjoy the movie as a movie. That didn't go very well because it's not very good as a movie either.I don't know who thought it was a good idea to have one movie cover about seven months of history, but they need to be fired. This movie condenses the Attack on Pearl Harbor, the aftermath, the Raid on the Marshal Islands, the Doolittle Raid, the Battle of Coral Sea, and the Battle of Midway into one movie.I know who these guys are, however the audience must be so confused as characters come and go with maybe a few minutes of screen time. Take the Pearl Harbor scene, we get this officer telling an enlisted sailor to set up deck chairs for the Sunday church service. The enlisted sailor says he's an atheist and I rolled my eyes figuring this kid will be a secondary characters learning about faith and god and stuff.... I was giving the movie too much credit. After the Attack on Pearl Harbor he has one more scene. You see it was the officer that was important because he was close friends with Lt. Cmd Dick Best, our main character and he needed to ask the kid what happened to his friend.Then the whole second act is basically everything that happened between Pearl Harbor and Midway, (that's December 1941 to June 1942). They have Admiral Halsey in this movie for some reason as a secondary character which was probably not a good idea because Halsey wasn't at Midway so I'm wondering why are we spending time with a character who won't matter in the freaking climax and leaving people don't know this wondering why this Admiral Spruance is joining us this late in the movie.It just goes on like this for 2 hours.Things I did like was the sound design and I really enjoyed seeing the CGI renditions of the real ships. I liked that I could look at ships and actually identify them by class. The battles mostly look fine, but I have problems with Pearl Harbor (but that's mostly nitpicking)... though the CGI during that scene did look odd. The acting was also fine, eventually I got used to some of the cheesy 1940s accents the actors were using.I don't hate this movie but if you know nothing about World War II this movie will not be fun because you'll be very confused. If you do know a lot about World War II you still won't like it because they abridge so many important events and people.Go see the 1970s version, it was a tighter and more accurate film."
"Following our naval hero ""Dick Best"" through some significant WWII moments seemed more like pro-war propaganda than true war. The screen was alive with star studded names and Captain America like bravery full of cliche dialogue and cowering cowards needing encouragement from the brave heroes we all have come to know through the annals of history. I couldn't help but snicker towards the end as my boyish comedic brain was firing on all cylinders as we watch ""Dick Best"" heroically drop a bomb on the last Japanese carrier exclaiming ""This is for Pearl Harbor!"" as he narrowly escapes the explosions and the seabed below. I was able to almost recite verbatim his speech to his cowering gunner who no longer wanted to fight that if he didn't do this he would regret it the rest of his life. Or the pure comedic moment another Pilot is grasping for bravery and asking Dick to turn in his wings only for Dick to promise to watch after the young pilot and be his wingman only in the very next scene to witness the scared, young pilot not even be able to get his plane off the deck of the carrier as Dick Best yells to abort!The special effects and battle scenes are entertaining and visually stunning on the newer screens with incredible sound systems. Our seats were rumbling the whole time but to expect anything more than a smash and grab job of a film would be putting yourself in a position of great disappointment."
"I would like to start by acknowledging that many of the reviews here are written by veterans or their family members. As a son of a US army soldier, I respect their views but respectfully disagree. My review is not about the accuracy of navy procedure or even the accuracy of the movie in general. If you want that, there are many others who have reviewed the movie on this basis. I am here to review this as what it is, a movie.Midway is a misguided mess. A movie that is supposedly a retelling of the decisive naval battle does not open strong. In fact, in the first scene, we are introduced to the main problem of this movie. Midways' editing is atrocious. One moment we are in 1930's japan, then the attack on pearl harbor. The way scenes are edited together is messy. A scene can come and go without any real relation to the scene preceding and proceeding. Because of this, the story comes off as choppy and we get long amounts of time where characters just disappear from the story only to pop up randomly later. This isn't helped by the fact that we are never introduced to characters outside of what I guess is our main protagonist, Lieutenant Richard ""Dick"" Best. I say this because, as I said before, there are large portions of screen-time he just disappears. Along with this, characters do not progress through the film. They pop up randomly having achieved something off screen since the time we last saw them. Best is a great example of this. Outside of his initial introduction, we see him do very little until the real battle.This is one of Midways greatest faults, the ""characters"" are poorly developed and get no screen-time to develop themselves out of what we as the viewer are introduced to them as. Best is introduced as a cocky smart-mouth who's one hell of a pilot. That is what he is. Nothing is done to develop him out of this and we learn nothing about him. This would have been fine in a 70's action movie. However, this is based on a real person. Someone who actually fought in the battle of Midway. Almost everyone suffers from this, a great example is Joseph Rochefort, the Chief Cryptanalyst during this time. He is given no introduction. Thrown onscreen and portrayed as an eccentric who is good at his job. He is given one scene and then disappears forever. All ""characters"" in this movie are nothing more than means to an end.This is all a fault of the overall narrative. Midways' storytelling is awful. ""Characters"" are thrown into the plot to only disappear and never be mentioned again. No regard is given to time as we fly down the timeline, sticking scenes that are sometimes months apart next to each other with no mention. Events like the bombing of Tokyo are thrown in with no concern, given a few scenes, then forgotten about and wrapped up in an ending memorial. What makes this worse is that we never stick with one story for more than a few scenes. The plot jumps around after every scene. Sometimes forgetting stories for long periods only to jump back with no real continuity. This is compounded by the fact that the dialogue sucks. It's cheesy, dated, and sometimes downright cringe-inducing.The real tragedy of Midway, however, is that underneath all of this there is a beautiful movie. The cinematography in this movie was fantastic. The attack on pearl harbor and the battle itself is magnificent. When we actually follow the planes into battle I found myself shocked by how well done the shots were.This is why I'm more disappointed with Midway than anything. Because once we get past the poor editing and story. We get what I consider a good battle scene. Once the plot actually slows down and follows the battle, we get a good movie. We still have the Cheesy dialog and overuse of poorly done CGI. However, the movie actually picks itself up and delivers us a great battle. We have callbacks to the original attack on pearl harbor and well-executed character moments. In fact, we have an amazingly-done scene of Best and his co-pilot as they prepare to go back out to find the final aircraft carrier. Along with this, the scene of the Japanese commander going down with his ship is a shining moment that shows the movie can have well-written scenes.This is the true tragedy of Midway. Underneath all the problems, we have brilliant cinematography and a potentially great third act. Because of everything else though, this is nothing more than what could have been. A movie that is dedicated to those who died in these battles and risked their lives in it can do better, and should. Like I said before. I'm not here to review this movie for its accuracy. I'm not here to pretend I understand what these men sacrificed. If you want that, there are other reviews that will tell you that. I'm only here to tell you of what could have been a good movie, and what we got. Would I recommend this? No."
"People are awful at reviews. A 6.9? Was that a typo? Because this is officially the greatest movie of all time. Looking at the reviews, I noticed it was very similar to ""12 Strong"", another movie that I loved. I had high hopes for this film, and it did not disappoint for one millisecond. This was one of the biggest conflicts in American history and I'm glad we have a movie that showcases it very accurately. My love for the United States has grown after watching this. I don't normally cry, but I got teary-eyed. The acting was superb, the plot was obviously incredible, and the attention to detail was impeccable. Argue all you want, but this is the movie to see for generations to come. What's that smell? Oh, it must be some Academy Awards!"
"Some cheesy lines but, over all relatively accurate and graphics better than the trailers looked."
"This film does an excellence job of telling the story of the first six months of the Pacific Theatre of WWII in just a bit over 2 hours. I especially liked the inclusion of the Doolittle Raid as the Japanese attack on Midway was an attempt at retaliation for the attack on Tokyo because it cause a considerable loss of face to Tojo the Japanese Army.There are no actors wasted on fictional characters and no nonsensical romances mucking up the film. The Japanese speak Japanese. Admiral Yamamoto's ability to speak English is also revealed. Thanks to CGI, the actual ships and planes that were used in the battles are accurately depicted, including those which are now at the bottom of the Pacific."
"As a student of history, whose interest was originally piqued as a kid by the 1976 version of Midway (which told a great story, with great actors, but was also one rolling anachronism with little attention to historical accuracy or detail), I was completely mesmerized.There are multiple histories written about the USS Enterprise (the CV-6 tragically sold for scrap in New Jersey in the early 1960s, after naval service equalled only by the USS Constitution); the Navy air groups that flew off of her; and the first seven months of the Pacific Theater of World War II - and it is apparent that Tooke and Emmerich have read all of them.The level of historical detail throughout - from the tension b/t the Japanese Army and Navy about the wisdom of going to war with the US, the hazards (and casualties) of early flight training in SBDs and Devastators, the Feb 1942 hit and run raids on the Marshall's and Gilbert's, the execution of 250,000 Chinese suspected to have hidden the Doolitle Raiders from the Japanese after bombing Tokyo - was remarkable, without even getting to the Midway battle scenes. And of course, I was impressed when they showed a doomed B-26 just miss wiping out the Akagi's bridge at the outset (history says the plane was flown by Herbert Mayes and a crew of 5 from Midway).I had to warm up to Woody Harrellson as Chester Nimitz, esp. when Henry Fonda was my previous point of reference, but by the end, I thought the casting was well done on both sides. Patrick Wilson was terrific playing Edwin Layton - Emmerich hit the nail on the head not inventing any stories to try and make the movie more interesting. The history of the time was the story, Layton was perfectly positioned to see it then, and this movie tells it really well.I could go on about this movie, but just ignore the critics (if you didn't grow up on this history, you'll never be able to appreciate the commitment to accuracy and detail that went into it) and just go see it. I'm grateful that someone finally got the story straight."
Best war movie I've seen in a long time! Kept me on me on the edge of my seat the entire movie.
"Every American needs to see this movie to be reminded of real heroes , real problems and what real patriots are"
"I guess I can report on the obvious efforts to make everything look so real, as many others have pointed, which would not add much to what was already stated.I would like to address the claim from someone that there was an 'obvious error' in having McCluskey not having lost his bomb (it was Max Leslie from the Yorktown, who is not portrayed in the movie, who lost his bomb due to a fault in the arming mechanism).The over-Hollywood things that caused the loss of one star is the dramatic dead stick landing of the last plane well after everyone else came back (I mean, come on, everyone took off at the same time, went to attack the same ship; coming back well after everyone else means he would have needed to stop somewhere...), the fact that Nimitz learned as a pleasant surprise the deception of having the enemy report on the loss of water processing capability on Midway (Nimitz was notified from the beginning, as he had to authorize the preparation of the fake report), and (probably an oversight that most everyone would have missed) the fact that a ship as large as an aircraft carrier exploding would still have the report come a second later than the flash, since sound is still propagating at, well, the speed of sound.On the (very very) positive plus side: the almost maniacally accurate depiction of the aircraft and ships, a selection of actors that is apparently not based on the star status of the actor but on the fact that, with the proper haircut, those actors are jaw-dropping doppelganger of the real historical figures. When I first heard Woody Harrelson would be portraying Chester Nimitz, I had doubts. But see the pictures? Holy smoke! That's HIM!That film should have been longer, there is so much that happened that is not shown (the amazing work of Yorktown's damage control crew, who managed to keep operational a ship that kept getting hit; the CAP fighters protecting the fleet and escorting the waves of attack planes, with their Thach Weave that helped balance the superior speed and maneuverability of the A6M Zero), but I assume a film long enough to do justice to all the action would reduce the number of showing per screen... Well, hopefully, there will be a 2 DVD edition some day..."
"Don't get me wrong. It's a great movie, and well worth a watch, but it lacks the emotional, visceral engagement of Dunkirk or Saving Private Ryan. I didn't feel vested enough in the characters. Their backstories were very thin. And there was little juxtaposition between the action and, well, anything else.Overall, a great CGI packed action movie but more popcorn flick than gut-wrencher."
I loved it. Very entertaining. Good acting. Great story.
An amazing historical film about the Battle of Midway! Everything was done well and the movie was emotionally capturing. I only wish the CGI to be little better.
Never expect before. So great action. Great to seen in theater.
OK am I too had a little bit too much CGI but that could be overlooked because of how historically accurate it was and quite literally the most important Naval engagement during the Pacific Theater of WW2
"This portrayal lacks the sense of the ebb and flow of the battle, especially when compared to that shown in the 1976 version. In fact, your time would be better spent getting that version on DVD and just fast-forwarding through every Charlton Heston/Edward Albert scene."
"Sorry, the computer graphics were terrible. It looked like an arcade video game and the acting was weak at best, save your money and pass."
"This movie feels like a scene that we see in a movie like on a tv or something. Literarly this movie cannot be any more cliche. You don't have to be cinephile to figure that out. All the bad actings, not shooting on location and using horrible green screen work, almost like buyed soundtracks... and the screenplay.. ahh those unnecessary scenes that don't serve the story at all. Not even mentioning the fact that the characters were so bad developed. I mean I didn't even remember who was who and what they did most of the time. Anyone saw Dunkirk before wouldn't give that movie more than 4 or 5. My rate is 3 just to respect the great cg work on action scenes."
"Absolute trash. They managed to make one of the most exciting moments in history a boring piece of garbage. I was expecting a tight account of the several coincidences, doubts, gambles and strategies that led to the outcome. Instead, I got an unwarranted focus on 2d-rendered characters I couldn't care less for. It's hard to understand the real dynamics of Midway watching this film. Other shortcomings: 1) ClichÃ©s, such as pilots questioning their commanders orders in their face and doing ""rebel"" things, as if this was ""Top Gun"". 2) Terrible choice of starting the story from Pearl Harbour. Because of this, the script is cramped and many scenes are rushed. The day of Midway needed two hours of narration itself to adequately tell the almost unbelievable development of events. It was a griding day of crucial choices and risks taken, that would not show their consequences until two hours later. Tension at its best. 3) Ok with the ""realism"", but why insist with japanese people speaking Japanese and having me reading subtitles? That was unnecessary. 4) The CGI. Good grief. Most of it is very good. But in the most spectacular moments, you can clearly see the heavy hand of the director and imagine him say: ""More spectacular! More spectacular!"". I'm talking about the super fake cameras moving around the crashing planes: that was good 20 years ago, now it's just boring and fake. Gimme some good vehicle mounted cameras (as Nolan and Miller still do) and that's ten times more breathtaking. Other laughable and heavy-handed CGI moments are the large fires: burning Pearl Harbour has nothing realistic to a trained eye, it's more similar to an imperial cruiser crashing on a planet. 5) Exposition. 6) Acting. They spent 100 millions, and couldn't sign good actors, aside from Harrelson who by the way is going through the motions.
Overall: hot garbage."
"Ups;
Casting was successful especially with the Japanese historical figures. Something that is not really expected from modern Hollywood in that sense. Camera angles during action scenes and sound effects were quite good. The personal conversations were not over-streched. They were just on time with the story flow.Downs;
The historic incidents that happened in the Midway were all accurate with the US scores yet the Japanese hit on Yorktown and it's sinking was skipped. We saw the only Japanese carrier attack group that was able to strike American ships taking off but haven't seen how they did till the end. Personally I was also expecting a little deeper storyline for the USS Yorktown. That ship with it's crew gave 110% starting from Battle of Coral Sea till the very last moments of the Midway. We didn't see much of it other than it's fast recovery. Marshall Island's skirmish was unnecessary to include for the storyline. The Battle of Coral sea could have been shown instead. For the last part I want to underline that CGI hasn't improved much despite the years of technological improvements. Let's say not for this movie particularly.I gave 6.5/10 (too good for 6 and too bad for 7 out of 10)"
"""Midway"" (2019 release; 138 min.) brings the story of the WWII battle of Midway. As the movie opens, it is ""December 4, 1937"", and British, US and Japanese dignitaries are exchanging toasts in the name of peace. We then go to ""December 7, 1941"", as the Japanese are starting to attack Pearl Harbor... At this point we are 10 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this movie is directed by Roland Emmerich, yes, he of ""Independence Day"" (and its sequel), ""2012"", ""White House Down"", and so on. That is really all you need to know to put this latest version of ""Midway"" into perspective. Character development is minimal, but who cares anyway, as we all await the battle scenes. Once they come, starting with Pearl Harbor and culminating in the movie's last hour with the actual battle of Midway (on June 4, 1942, amazingly only 6 months after Pearl Harbor), all restraint is thrown overboard, and it's almost an assault on the senses. And yes, quite enjoyable. The thing is that the battle scenes are perfect, frankly too perfect. Think of it like watching video games on steroids. I can't help but think back to the 1976 movie of the same name covering the same events (starring Charlton Heston and Henry Fonda), when CGI was not available and the movie makers used other means (including actual archival footage from the battle). While I enjoyed the Roland Emmerich re-imagination of Midway better than I expected, I nevertheless feel that the 1976 movie is slightly better, or perhaps I should say that it feels more realistic. Please note: Emmerich financed this $100 million production movie independently outside the Hollywood studio system, and he ended up getting a sizable part of the budget financed through Chinese investors. That comes at a cost of course, and hence the script makes a couple of unnecessary, if not questionable, detours into China's role (?) in the battle of Midway. A darn shame.""Midway"" opened wide several weeks ago, and I finally got around to seeing it. The Friday matinee screening where I saw this at the day after Thanksgiving was attended okay (about 20 people in a large theater). If you have an interest in WWII and/or in big budget war movies, I'd readily suggest you check this out, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion."
"I mildly prefer the 1976 version of ""Midway"", although not by a lot. That version starred just about every leading man in Hollywood at that time. I'd have to see the 1976 version again to judge the historically accuracy, but as I recall, it was not inaccurate.The new version is entertaining. The CGI is pervasive but quite good. At a few points I found myself thinking ""this is good CGI"", followed quickly by ""ah, but it's CGI"". Then again, since we no longer have squadrons of PBY's or Grumman torpedo bombers lying around, CGI is the only alternative.This movie is quite watchable, with several well-drawn characters. Worth your time."
It is fine but i am not so much into that kind of movies so you have to be in to it but it was a good movie
"This crap tell the story how a evil empire jumped into a conflict they should never have been apart of and this ""movie"" show how they won a battle against another evil empire. AND as we clearly are told initially and after the ""movie"" this film is sponsored by a third even more evil empire. Propaganda through and through.And apparently they won by using CGI planes flying about like gravity-defying space ships, and by using atrocious dialogue to bore the enemy to death.This is actually worse than Endgame, and worse than Us. I think it is the worst crap I have seen this year.If you go and watch this movie, I suggest bring vodka and every time you see badly done CGI or you hear bad dialogue you drink... you will be passed out after 20min..."
"It appears Hollywood does not know how to make a WWII movie. Pearl Harbor was a bit of a disappointment but Midway 2019 was far worse. The original 1976 Midway movie was far better. It would be great to blend the best parts of the 1976 Midway with the modern graphics of Midway 2019.There was no depth to this movie. Too many characters who were each ill defined. No character development at all. If you are a student of WWII as I am you, of course, know the story. But for those who are not familiar with the events and details of WWII they are greeted with a choppy exposure to bits and pieces of the true story. Forget historical accuracy.There were scenes of air battles or attacks involving the ground or ships but they would abruptly end and the scene would shift to a quiet dialog portion that seemed quite out of place. The next scene change would then be to some dramatic high volume war segment.The graphics were the highlight of this movie and there were many scenes that were well constructed. Nearer to the beginning of the movie the ships in Pearl Harbor were about 90% real, unfortunately that 10% that was missing was quite visible. The rest of the graphics were quite good.I can't comment on the acting because I don't think the director gave the staff a chance to show their talents. While I very much like Woody Harrelson he was not the right actor for this role.It really is a shame that the director did such a poor job on this movie. It is quite clear that huge amounts of money were spent on sets, which were very good, but they were wasted by not focusing on a thread of a story.I did something that is extremely rare for me. I walked out about 10 minutes before the end of the movie. I just couldn't take any more."
"Lots of action, graphics, and special visual effects but jumps between significant events with lean foundation for the event and effect. Acting was well done.I wasn't expecting a documentary but the ""What Happened"" and a little ""Why"" was very thin. If you are impressed with special visual effects you will like it. I saw the 1976 version of Midway a couple time so can't help making the comparison. In my opinion it flowed between events and personal plots better and was a more rounded movie."
"It felt like a made for tv movie that was drawn out. Script was pretty bad..not much else to say... I'll never think of this movie again in about an hour. If you're going expecting Dunkirk , Pearl Harbor or any other great war flicks you will be pretty dissappointed."
"If you're old enough to have seen the 1976 film, 'Battle of Midway', you may, like me, find this film very disappointing. Yes, there were some good actors amongst the cast, and the characters were all there, the ill disciplined, anti establishment cowboy who becomes a hero, the scared one who, well, yes, becomes a hero and all the others in between, but they were all but drowned in a tsunami of O.T.T. CGI. It was too gung ho for my liking, too bitty, too reliant on all the flash bangs at the expense of the back story."
"Tha acting and dialogue were so contrived and poorly done, there was no way I could sit through 2 more hours of it. Saw Ford vs Ferrari instead. Best move I could've made."
"It's really bad. Tons of random stars are in it with a terrible script, cheesy lines, bad accents, nonsensical events, the fakest looking CGI I've ever seen, no character development. Seriously, skip this. It's not even worth a redbox rental.One highlight, the Japanese commanders were well cast and acted.Find Tora Tora Tora on Netflix instead."
"Weak main acting, seemed stiff and forced. Done in a period style but too many characters and not much depth to any of them.Would have been better if they had limited to story of 2 or 3 characters with better actors. Some good actors flash through the movie, but they just had cameos."
"O Really enjoy all minuts of thia film, i recommend!!!!"
I thought we were done with big battle CGI fests. It's just another mindless movie
You simply can't emotionally connect to so many People. Dunkirk did it best when narrowing it down and letting us follow their journey. Instead we're supposed to care about Ed Skreins one note character who reminds me so much of Tommy Wiseau it's hilarious
"No more accurate than 1976 version.Looks like a CGI FESTIVAL! Over the top violations of the laws of physics and aerodynamics.Weak writing, but noble effort by cast given crappy script."
"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)With all due respect to Roland Emmerich and to his fantastic Independence Day, his movies never quite reach their potential, ending up in constant disappointments. It doesn't matter if he has excellent casts or amazing VFX teams, his films' screenplays are almost always stuffed with narrative issues. Midway is simply another installment in his saga of letdowns. Without knowing the director, anyone who looks at this movie will feel instantly captivated. From the unbelievably talented cast to the impressive visuals, it has two attention-grabber ingredients, which can result in a remarkable film... only if the two pillars of any cinematic production are decent enough: story and characters.These are the main issue with Emmerich's movies. His characters are not compelling or intriguing enough, and his screenplays lack creativity and excitement (whether these are written by him or someone else). When I noticed that Midway had such an acclaimed cast and that it was about the Battle of Midway, I immediately got excited. War epics are a genre that I sincerely appreciate. However, when I checked who was ""running the show"", I instantly lowered my expectations. Honestly, it's exactly what I expected it to be: visually gripping, but emotionally hollow.I don't want to understate it. The CGI work in this film is jaw-dropping. The actual war is riveting with astonishing aerial sequences and powerful sound design. Even at a regular screening with the usual 7.1 Dolby surround speakers, the floor was rumbling with the explosions and the planes. This is why I think audiences will definitely enjoy this movie. Maybe not a vast majority, but surely most people will leave their theaters feeling it was good entertainment. It has a long runtime, and it's hard to get through the exposition-heavy story, but in the end, I bet the general public will appreciate the war action enough to give the whole thing a thumbs up.Nevertheless, it's still a very superficial flick. While it's very respectful to everyone who fought in the war (including the Japanese) and to the historic event on itself, it lacks emotional attachment to its characters. Dunkirk was praised by both critics and audiences all around the world, but its main criticism connects to what I just wrote. Christopher Nolan's film also didn't have any compelling characters. However, there's a big difference between these two movies. Both their marketing and their ultimate goal are distinct. Dunkirk was all about showing the actual war. It never marketed itself as a character-study or that it would even have a significant focus on some of the heroes that fought there. Nolan repeated several times: it's about the war and the war only.It's genuinely one of the best, if not the best, *pure* war film I've ever seen. When it comes to depicting the claustrophobic, unbreathable, restless, bloody, loud event that a devastating war is, Dunkirk is so realistic it can even become uncomfortable with just sitting in your chair (at least, I did in IMAX). On the other hand, Midway's marketing was about paying homage to ""people who fought in the Battle of Midway"". Hence the stellar cast compared to Nolan's just competent actors (with obvious exceptions like Mark Rylance or Tom Hardy). It spends most of its screentime trying to develop the actual people that helped win that battle, not with the action itself. Therefore, these characters need engaging scripts and emotionally resonant arcs.Wes Tooke delivers a screenplay packed with so much exposition that a lot of it looks clearly unrealistic. Characters discuss specific topics that don't make any sense of being in a conversation at a particular time and place. Throughout the runtime, there are dialogue sequences with the sole purpose of explicitly telling the audience what we need to know to understand the story, which ends up turning the narrative confusing, convoluted, and lacking faster pacing. It's tough to get through the non-action periods, and I can't even imagine how dull it would be without such an impeccable cast. Ed Skrein remarkably portrays Dick Best, the only character who's genuinely compelling and carries a complete, well-developed arc.Unfortunately, I didn't feel invested in any other character. Only the best movies of every year can have a numerous and talented cast while giving each and every actor an exciting role. Midway has too many characters for the story it wants to tell. In addition to this, it has to stretch its runtime because you can't get Woody Harrelson or Dennis Quaid playing secondary roles and not giving them more than just a couple of lines. As time goes by, Emmerich's storytelling structure gets needlessly more and more complicated to follow. It's yet another film added to the ""wasted potential"" list...Potential due to how truly magnificent the action sequences can be. It's undeniable that these are entertaining, gripping, and exciting. The dive bombers' scenes are packed with so much tension that I was getting more and more frustrated every time they missed their target, and a bomb went into the sea. I wanted them to succeed so bad, and this feeling can only be triggered by something extraordinary. Midway's war is as close to epic as it could be, but as with every other cinematic production, if its story and its characters are not up to par with the action, there are no outstanding VFX that can save a lousy screenplay.All in all, Midway is a respectful homage to the people who fought in the Battle of Midway, but it fails to deliver an engaging story with compelling characters. With more characters that what it needed, the runtime is stretched beyond its limit due to the numerous acclaimed actors who would never be in a movie if they didn't have more than a couple of lines. Roland Emmerich has to thank his VFX team for presenting the closest war action we could ever get of the famous battle. Truly epic visuals with tense and riveting aerial sequences, plus a powerful sound design, get your teeth biting the nails. Unfortunately, except for Ed Skrein's character, I didn't feel invested enough to appreciate the non-action moments due to the confusing, convoluted, and exposition-heavy narrative. It's a shame that a visually impressive film possesses such an emotionally dull story. However, I still recommend it for anyone who enjoys war epics and ""based on a true story"" adaptations.PS: it doesn't hurt to research a bit about the Battle of Midway. I didn't and I'm sort of regretting that now. Don't make the same mistake. Going in with basic knowledge of what, how, and why it happened will only help you enjoy this movie more."
"Typical hollywood movie. I do like that this was made as the battle of midway is something that should be told. However, this is not the right director for this movie. Why would you get the guy who does fx movies with little to no characters or characters without depth to do this film? I found the characters to be shallow and little more than 'hey look at who is in this movie'.
Its like he wanted to do Tora Tora Tora but without the substance. The battles are interesting, however for 100mil you could have less green screen cgi mashups. A good rental only."
"Too many camera changes, well over 2000. I had to watch this a few times to figure out just what was wrong with it; there was just something not quite right. The scenes didn't 'flow' together, it seemed like it was all just stuck together. Then it hit me; it was just 'all stuck together'. Each scenes is almost all just quick one or two second video clips, joined to create the final product. Then that is joined to make another. No cohesion. No continuity. You very rarely see both characters in a conversation at the same time, because they weren't there at the same time; each was filmed from behind so you saw the other person without any camera behind them. So it feels disjointed. I watched it three tijmes, and averaged 2136 separate video clips for the entire movie. All were taken separetely. No wonder if feels like it's not together; because you don't get to see the characters interact; you only see one at a time; when that one is done speaking, the other takes a turn. Same with the flying. You see the pilot, they cut away and all you see is feet, or all you see it stick, or all you see is throttle. It's never the whole person. When two people are in a conversation, you have no idea what the other person is feeling/thinking while the other character speaks, because you can't see their face. They may as well be talking to a manniquin. Perhaps it's cheaper to do it this way? Short solo scenes are easier for actors do to, less to memorize for each couple of sentences, and of course, with only one person speaking in each clip, it's easy to just have one person do it. Watch the 1976 version and see the difference (that one, BTW, has a total of 1023 scenes). Don't take my word for it. Watch both. See which flows better. Yes, the 2019 film has plenty of explosions, lots of shooting, but the story? Nope. Plane appears to be flying directly into the side of a ship, but comes out high on the other side. HOW? We never see it. All the flying here is CGI and special effects. Nothing real like you see in the 1976 version.
Oh yes, and the first 25 minutes of this 2019 film, were of the attack on Pearl Harbor, then some more on the Doolittle raid on Tokyo. So they apparently had to rush through the story about Midway. Perhaps a terrific movie for a Saturday matinee for the kiddies."
This has the look of a disaster movie written all over it. Not a BAD movie...but instantly forgettable.Now....where was I?...oh yes...Midway.The CGI for me was just overdone..and i hoped the storytelling would make up for it...but alas no.All that money on blue screens and nothing spent on a script..and to be honest the acting was shocking.Not a bad way to spend a few hours but will be forgotten very soon
Disregard negative reviews. They were written by this generation that does not want you to know about our heroes. They bad mouth our country at every turn. The acting was awesome. A few Hollywood moments but a great historical movie. Woody actually looks like a Nimitz. Dick Best actually lived into his ninetiesGod bless America
"I'm somewhat confused by all the high scored reviews, we seem to have watched different films.In my eyes this is a classic example of attempted style over substance where a huge amount of money has been thrown as what is essentially a very bad made-for-tv script and then directed by a hack in full Michael Bay mode.The pacing is deeply uneven, the accents are often bordering on atrocious (stop forcing actors that can't do a convincing accent foreign to them to do one for god's sake), the acting is all nover the place (dennis quaid being a strange example of a really good actor horribly directed as a walking gruff cliche) with the best performances being woody harrellson (in a role that didn't push him in any way) and the japanese admiral/generals (although they are largely presented as pastiche save for a couple of moments). The somewhat dodgy CGI is heavily over-relied on, especially in the opening battle making for a jarring and visually chaotic experience where it didn't blend particularly well (it does work fairly well in the main battle sequence, which is the best part of the film by a very very long way).Character development is thin on the ground, what little there is mostly being crammed into about 15minutes before the main battle. Although I mention development, you can't really develop two-dimensional cardboard cutouts that are essentially walking talking cliches (something which plagues almost every aspect of the film: seeming obliviousness to agonising cliche). The dialogue meanwhile is simply abominable except for one or two short exchanges which raise expectations only to have them quickly dashed again in the next scene.The director of photography and the person doing the scoring appear to have tried their very best to put the oscar-worthy epic films stamp on it, but mostly serve to over-egg the pot and further highlight the rest of the film's short-comings. It's almost like someone planned the aerial scenes in the battle of midway then frantically tried to cobble a film together around them. There are a few small nods to the period and atmosphere of the time, but just that, small ineffectual nods that simply place the setting in that peculiar world of soft-focus, sepia-tinted, whisky-soaked nostalgia that never existed but is used as a crutch in so many films.This film has very clear aspirations above its station but merits none of them and conveys little of the surrounding history. A tale full of sound and fury, told by an idiot and signifying nothing (with a cool dogfight and a couple of noble deaths.)(I will give them a tip of the hat where due for deigning to recognise the japanese as actual human beings as opposed to just inscrutable stoic enemies in the ending dedication.)"
"Imagine every war movie cliche possible. Combine these into a movie. The result is Midway. A friend I saw the movie with even asked if it was new, as he thought he had seen it before.Even the effects were not top notch, often feeling like a computer game, took me out of the movie several times.On the plus side I really liked the sound, and most of the acting is good."
"I'm a bit nostalgic since I saw the original ""Midway"" in 1976 IN Sensurround! For 10 year olds we still knew the story and the hardware, e.g. the difference between a F4F Wildcat and a F6F Hellcat or that the torpedo planes should've been TBD Devastators and not SBD Dauntless. Midway (1976) used real airplanes and WW2 gun camera footage alongside outtakes from ""Tora Tora Tora"", ""30 Seconds over Tokyo"", ""The Battle of Britain"", and ""Storm Over the Pacific""; and one really out of place jet plane crash on the USS Essex (from the Korean War). It had Charlton Heston, Henry Fonda, Pat Morita, Hal Holbrook and a cast of stars and future stars (Tom Selleck, Eric Estrada) ... It's one of my favorite movies despite some inaccuracies and 1970's limitations. That all said, I HATED ""Pearl Harbor"" (2001). After a certain point film-makers have the technology and HISTORY to tell an accurate story (I could write a Phd. dissertation on the inaccuracies of ""Pearl Harbor). So (FINALLY) where does Midway 2019 rank? I give it 4 stars (out of 10). Midway was a HUGE battle and setting it up w/ Pearl Harbor AND the Doolittle Raid added too much story to tell in 2 hours 20 minutes. If anything the film SHOULD'VE been titled ""Enterprise CV-6"" since apparently only pilots and crew from that ship did anything in the Battle of Midway (or that's what the Director thinks). Missing (completely) from the movie: Rear Admiral Fletcher who was the (frickin') overall commander of the fleet defending Midway. Also MIA, US Fighter planes...really! No mention or footage of ANY US fighter planes (just dive bombers and torpedo planes). No mention that USS Yorktown's/Hornet's fighter cover that had to turn back or ditch in the ocean. No mention of portrayal of the brave Marines (led by Major Parks) flying obsolete Brewster Buffalos defending Midway Island (they got obliterated)... no portrayal of the Yorktown fighter escort (led by CDR John Thatch) that actually engaged the Japanese combat air patrol only losing one plane (shooting down 6) and allowing VT-3 to attack the Japanese fleet. Not ONE F4F-Wildcat in the entire movie. There were some other inaccuracies (like HUGE holes in the Order of Battle: e.g. VT-8, from Hornet attacked first, not VT-6 and the ""Glee"" guy, from Enterprise) but in closing I'll just say that anyone from the USS Yorktown or USS Hornet or even the (glossed over) USS Lexington should feel pretty slighted by this movie. But hey, at least this movie has a Jonas Brother."
"Having watched and come to love the original Midway movie starring some juggernauts of Hollywood history, I was really looking forward to a more modern version of the story of Midway.However this movie suffers in the same way as Pearl Harbour was a bad movie, only this time there is no love story. My heading states badly executed, here is why.Plot:
The movie itself is overloaded with narrative, from the attack on Pearl Harbour, to the Doolittle raid over Tokyo then onto Midway. Everything moved so quickly that there is no real character development nor any real reason to invest any emotion in them.Pace:
Imagine having a DVD with the events of WW2 and then playing it on 10x speed, that's how this movie was. In my opinion the attack Pearl Harbour should have been left out, and start the movie with the Doolitle raid. At just over 2hrs, this movie was so overloaded that it missed key important and interesting elements of the events leading to the battle.Cast:
I love Woody Harrelson, and he looked and acted the part, but was so under used it was very disappointing. I also love Dennis Quaid, he was probably one of the standout actors on the movie playing Admiral Halsey. However I felt he had too much air time in the movie considering he wasn't involved in the battle due to being hospitalized. The two US admirals (Fletcher and Spruance) who were involved had very little to no airtime in the movie, this made no sense as they had to make on the spot decisions that helped turn the tide of the battle, specifically Spruance's decision to launch the first attack at max range which cost the lives of some airmen due to running out of fuel. The actors who played the Japanese were pretty solid, seeing a familiar and reliable face of the actor who played Admiral Yamaguchi. But again I felt they deserved more airtime.Historically accurate?:
For the most part I would say yes, but even some of that is given some of the typical Hollywood treatment. For instance when Torpedo 8 has an unsuccessful attack on a battleship at Corak Sea due to poor torpedoes, and when the squadron is wiped out at Midway is 100% accurate, even the comments made by the Japanese commanders about how bad the planes and crews were is true, because the planes were outdated and crew not experienced.However there were some things they overlooked for instance the fact that a third of the Bombing 8 squadron had no bombs due to faulty equipment was missed out. The crucial role that fighting 8 played in the battle was cut. The invaluable role that the PBYs from Midway played in locating the Japanese fleet was cut (airgroup was called Strawberry) the movie suggested that it was Layton that put them on the right path, truth is that the Jap fleet were coming out of a big storm and it was unknown exactly where they would come out of."
"I was expecting a movie with emotion and you end up with a movie with poor, very poor, dialogues and a very strange flow. Good japonese actors and a nice woody was usually. Disappointment!"
"Awful, awful script.
The lines that the actors have to say are like something from a comic.
Reminded me a bit of '300' in its simplistic 'me good you bad' presentation."
"I simply love the build-up to this movie and that the crew made good researches for materials about some key individuals that were set for the title of this show, ""Midway"". I can see the critics are all over the place but they were wrong. Absolutely recommended watch."
Felt like a cheap computer game with real men standing in front of the green screen. Plenty of cheesy americanisims. Not a great movie.
"I was pressured to see this by a friend. I soon found out this film is a comedy. I couldn't stop laughing with the terrible acting.... and the Jonas brother.. aka the little engine that tried. I got up and cheered when he died. There's a couple of good scenes, I thought the Pearl Harbor attack was better than the whole film Pearl Harbor by Michael Bay. And I liked the Doolittle Raid... and the fact that my generation doesnt have the bravery of the Greatest Generation. I don't know if I could've done what these pilots did."
"I've seen the 1976 version and this one and the first thing I noticed was the ""Sloppy"" looking uniforms. I'm a veteran and the uniforms looked terrible. Next concern is one minute the pilots are at sea, the next they're back home in Hawaii. The constant jumping from American Carrier to Japanese carrier to aircraft flying to Midway, Japan, Hawaii leaves one constantly say, eh? What just happened? On the plus side are the special effects with the flying sequences. Aircraft looked very authentic even down to the dive brakes on the dauntless dive bombers. I'm not too sure about the methods that the Japanese used with captured U.S. military personnel. This movie was ok for a matinee showing but I almost wish I would have waited for the dvd release."
"This film was slightly better than I thought it was going to be. It's not a good movie but it's not terrible but what do I expect from director Roland Emmerich. It's definitely one of his better films but that isn't saying a lot. This has to be one of the worst scripts of the year. Every single line of dialogue was awful and insufferable. It was obvious that all the film cared about was its visual effects instead of its script and characters. Even though the characters are based on real people, they still feel very bland and boring. I don't know why they put Nick Jonas in this movie other than to just have him in the film. The acting from most of them isn't half bad. They are trying their hardest with the material they are given and do a good job for what the film is going for. Aaron Eckhart for his limited screen time probably gives the best performance of the entire film. Ed Skrein does a pretty terrible American accent though. There were aspects to the presentation of the film I did appreciate. Before I saw the film, I did some research on the Battle of Midway and the film was actually very historically accurate. The dive bombers did miss a lot of shots and maybe only one or two would manage to land a hit on the Japanese carriers. While some may call that cheesy within the film, it was historically accurate. I also like how the film didn't demonize the Japanese unlike a certain 2001 film (Pearl Harbor). It shows them as human too and that they were doing what they had to do to protect themselves and to follow orders. The action scenes weren't half bad but mostly forgettable although some scenes did look really cool. The visual effects weren't that bad either. They were pretty meh in the beginning but they got better as the film went along. Another thing I will give the film credit for was that it was for the most part entertaining. I didn't ever feel bored even with the 2 and a half hour runtime but that might be an issue for some. The music sounded like stock war film music and there was a large amount of war film cliches thrown into the film which were very obnoxious. Some scenes are loud enough where some actors have to overdub their voices but it wasn't properly synced up at some points which took me out of the film a little. Overall, Midway may be entertaining and very historically accurate but it falls victim to an awful script, bland characters, and too many typical war film cliches."
I went to see the film in the cinema in metrocentre and I found it lacking as many scenes have been rushed. As a history buff the Film lacked quality but the Film did gave historical account of the battle for Midway
"We start off with a scene of Edwin Layton at a party in Japan before returning to the United States from an assignment overseas. ADM Yamamoto chats with him in a room filled with large, framed photographs of various IJN vessels (many of which we've all seen before). This is the only time a Japanese person speaks English in the film; all the rest of the Japanese scenes are in Japanese. ADM Yamamoto is - at the time this scene occurs - serving as Navy Minister. He is wearing full ADM's insignia, which is inaccurate; he was not promoted ADM until 15 November 1940, over a full year after assuming command of the Combined Fleet. This minor point is indicative of how the IJN is going to be passed off in this film.As to the Japanese ships themselves, from what little they are shown - the USN is the main focus - don't look too bad at a glance. Akagi and Hiryu have their islands on the correct side (at least that much was accurate), though the bridge sets for the Japanese carriers could've been done a little better. The character of Genda Minoru is wearing Captain's insignia; again, incorrect; he was a CDR at Midway and was not promoted CAPT until 1 May 1944. He also appears to have taken over the role of Nagumo's Chief-of-Staff, as RADM Kusaka Ryunosuke (the actual Chief-of-Staff of 1st Air Fleet) was apparently eliminated from the film entirely.Yamato is shown in the film three times, but I was unable to tell if she is accurately portrayed (correct gun placements). Nagara is seen a couple times briefly during the air attacks; she doesn't look too bad at a glance. A Tone-class CA is also seen briefly in the same scene. There is a Kongo-class BB that the main character (LT Dick Best) flies over, though she appears to be portraying an early 1930s version of the ship as the bridge structure is horribly wrong. Tone #4 sights the Americans, and the vessel shown is a Colorado-class BB steaming along accompanied by what appear to be some DDs. I visibly cringed, as there were no American battleships present at the Battle of Midway.Another main character is Bruno Gaido. His capture and execution as a POW is portrayed, but it is done inaccurately. According to numerous sources, Gaido was tied to some fuel cans and dropped overboard. In the film, he is tied to a spare ANCHOR and dropped overboard. Where a DD got a spare anchor I have no idea; also, one would think fuel cans would be an easier prop to use than an anchor, but what do I know? Again, the insignia is wrong; the officer portrayed as Makigumo's CO (CDR Fujita Isamu) is wearing Captain's insignia; he never wore that rank while he was alive (posthumous promotion after being KIA as Senior Staff Officer of Cruiser Division 14 aboard Naka on 3 November 1943).The submarine Nautilus is shown attacking the Japanese fleet, though she is depicted as firing a torpedo at Akagi, which hits, but is a dud. In reality, she didn't attack a Japanese carrier until AFTER the fatal attack occurred, and the ship she attacked was Kaga, not Akagi.The sinking of the Japanese carriers is done well; Emmerich excels at explosions and his destruction of Kaga (pretty much the explosion of the White House in ID4, only put a carrier in place of the White House and no alien ship firing a laser beam at it and you've got it) is perfect proof of that statement. As in the 1976 film, the sinking of the heavy cruiser Mikuma on 6 June 1942 is eliminated entirely. Yamaguchi's final moments aboard Hiryu are depicted correctly for the most part; the only inaccuracy is that it is apparently his Adjutant - a LTJG - who asks to stay with him and not his Senior Staff Officer CDR Ito Seiroku. Also, Yamaguchi does not hand over his cap as a souvenir like he did in real life. While Hiryu is shown being torpedoed, she - like the other Japanese carriers - are not shown sinking on screen.One plus this film does have over Michael Bay's Pearl Harbor is that there is NO love story focus. The film does show interaction between one of the main characters (LT Dick Best) and his wife, but it is by no means a focal point of the story.In closing, if you're a fan of war movies, exciting aerial action, or explosions, watch it repeatedly...you'll love it. If you're a history buff, definitely see it once. If you're an IJN fan, see it once, but that's about all you need. The 1976 film - while more inaccurate, shows more of the Japanese side than this film does. Stick with that.My grade for Midway: A low 'B' or a high 'B-'. It's definitely worth seeing once, but I won't be paying to see it again in theaters, nor will I be buying it for my DVD collection. I might change my mind once it hits Walmart's $5 bin, but for right now, no."
"Rubbish film with too much CGI. The Battle of Midway didn't even matter as Japan did not have the resources or the industrial/military/economic capacity to defeat China, let alone the United States and the British Commonwealth and Empire as well."
"Midway tells the incredible true story of the Battle of the Midway in the Pacific Theater of World War II. It boosts an incredible star studded cast of talented actors, showcases flashy special effects and gives us a balanced perspective, but that movie can't help but feel just overly bland.Midway is yet another film by infamous director Roland Emmerich that fails to understand that drama is through character and not situations and explosions. In the end the film really fails the real people that risked their lives by portraying them as flat one dimensional people.As I said the cast is really good and sometimes they all manage to give at least something memorable to the film overall, but there's really not a reason to care for these characters aside that they're based on real people that have their lives. The action scenes are good, but it's nothing we haven't seen before and done much better.Midway ends up being a lifeless soulless recreation of historical events that fails to illuminate on the horrors of war, or the sacrifices made. It is just a stale and very bland film that never picks up and feels ultimately underwhelming and forgettable."
"I really enjoyed this movie. They did a good job on historical accuracy. All the actors did a great job playing real life people. I'm a student of this era of history and am please with the film. Other critics are nitpicky and rather stupid, which is why I don't usually listen to their reviews. Too many so called 'historical' films fall flat, but not this one. Go see it."
"Unlike the previous Midway movie, this one SHOULD be shown in a history class due to its historical accuracy. No ""love story sidelines"" to get in the way BUT it showed how war affects loved ones & families, not just those fighting. While graphic, it wasn't gratuitous. It fairly depicts both the American & Japanese sides and their decision-making well with the struggles they BOTH faced in a BALANCED way. YES, we won, but ALL wars have 2 sides. This presents the thinking of the OTHER SIDE, too. WE see no reason for why we were attacked, BUT let's look at what the thinking was from the OTHER side, agree with it or not. War tactics are some of the BEST EXPLAINED in this movie of any I've ever seen. The only frustration I had was with the subtitles. They were difficult to read at times due the lack of contrast between the words and the background. Personally, I dislike subtitles anyway. While it may have been deemed ""inappropriate,"" I'd rather they had the Japanese parts spoken in English with a Japanese accent. I felt I missed some words when I was unable to read everything thoroughly (and I'm a very good, fast reader) and missed seeing the emotion expressed by the speakers while reading. That's why I gave it a 9 & not a 10."
"After watching this movie I am not surprised that there is a concerted effort to post bad reviews in hopes of keeping folks away. A wonderful and moving glimpse into the bravery, sacrifices, compassion, ingenuity, leadership and fortitude of those who gave all for our freedom. WWII veterans are almost all gone now, and we need movies like this to remind us of what America was once and can be again. I am sure some liberties were taken, but when preparing to see this film with my son I reviewed the history of Midway and gave him a brief overview at dinner before we went to the theater. I realized that you cannot tell the story of Midway without starting at Pearl Harbor, moving to Doolittle's Raid, showing where the Midway Atoll is and talking about Admiral Yamamoto's idea of extending Japan's reach into most of the Pacific. Midway did exactly that, giving the full context and then showing the battle. A great move of American Exceptionalism!"
I was very skeptical going in to see this movie but I was very impressed by its accuracy. This movie is not for everyone that's evident but if you enjoy war movies that are faithful to history than it's definitely a good one to watch. It can be slow at parts and the CGI is also not the best but overall I was happy with my experience with the movie. I would recommend it to a friend who enjoys period pieces and war movies.
"After seeing the previous movies about Midway, I was not sure an update was needed. This movie says - yes, this one was needed. There are several reasons for it. The movies biggest strength is visual and it's next is no trying to over-reach.Previous versions of this story were melodramatic and hollywoodized beyond reality. This one isn't, and the best thing is no one cast member has such an ego that they attempt to dominate the movie. That is a refreshing change from previous depictions of this story.Intelligence information is used properly, and the lead up from 1937 to the Midway battle are really well done. The re-enactment of Pearl Harbor is well done. The miracle that the US Carriers were not in Pearl that day is not dwelled upon, just shown. That is the strength of the entire film. It is done as it happened. It amazes me that the 2 locations are Hawaii and Montreal, Canada.
It seems like there are more locales, but this is good film making, the story is rock solid, well written, and actually dominates the film instead of the acting. This does not happen often enough in movies.Loved the history of the characters at the end of the film, and did not realize that 2019 is the year the last of Doolittles raiders on the first bombing run on Tokyo died. It was important that this little side story got into the film. It was important as a morale boost to our efforts in the Pacific in the war. RIP"
The dialogue ruined the movie for me. Should had shown 2 hours of fighting would had been better
This was a tremendous movie about an amazing time in our history. Love it
Best balanced war movie ever made. Realistic to the core.
"Excellent movie, plenty of action and great acting."
"Heavy on action, this one will keep you glued to your seat. Go see it!"
"Midway absolutely delivers with its visual recreation of the battle of midway and several of the battles leading up to it.
The acting for the most part is spot on! The more well known actors like Dennis Quade and Woody Harrilson (probably spelled wrong) put fort a flawless performance. While even the lesser known actors do a pretty good job. Only a few poorly delivered lines out of the whole 2 hour + running time.
Based off of the limited research I did prior to seeing the film and what I knew previously, Midway gives a extremely accurate depiction of the battle. As well as the details of the war behind the scenes on both sides. My feeling is that it this film did quite well accurately describing the war from both the US and Japanese military. The film obviously has a American spin on the story, but I really appreciated how humanizing it is to both sides of the war. This is NOT an American military propaganda film.
All in all a solid film, however it's running time seems a little excessive. If they wanted to put that much detail into this, I would've loved to see this as a miniseries as opposed to a 2h+ film.
I hope there will be more films like this to come."
This movie blew me away. The actors were phenomenal. I can't wait to see it again!
"From Roland Emmerich (2012/Independence Day) comes his stylized (& albeit typically destructive take) on the famous skirmish between American & Japanese forces at sea. After making the fatal error in not believing the Japanese were going to strike Pearl Harbor, the Americans are determined to make a decisive attack on their foes by taking out their aircraft carriers (using dive bombing tactics). Using a plethora of CG imagery (some an eyesore, others impressive especially the aerial combat sequences) to depict the battle sequences, the film works whenever Emmerich decides to let the images speak for themselves but whenever the poor actors open their mouths to espouse obvious historical points in 40's twinged New Yawk accents, one's eye rolling can become a liability. Starring some Brits playing yanks like Ed Skrein (who's gunnery partner is played by Keean Johnson, they both were in Alita: Battle Angel) & Luke Evans & able support by Patrick Wilson, Woody Harrelson, Mandy Moore, Dennis Quaid, Aaron Eckhart, Nick Jonas & Darren Criss."
"Add in a totally fictitious romance plot with shallow lovers, a few token people of color in glamorized roles that may or may not have existed, and then amplified the plot to include women in a historically inaccurate but decisive role in winning the war. Thank God they chose to keep the plot as historically accurate as possible without any of the cinematic liberties that only serve to cause confusion and distort history. I loved this movie for representing history in a respectable and accurate way."
"Wow this film looked amazing and the acting was spot on , however it was proper cheesey but don't let that put you off its defo worth seeing in the cinema as i said it looks amazing ......!!!!"
"I should start by saying that I love WWII movies. I grew up in the 69s and 70s and have fond memories of watching the war movies of that era. Maybe that is why I was so disappointed in this film.The script was very fragmented, there was little character development, the acting was stiff, and the dialogue was flat. Even the battle sequences, as pretty as they were, did not build. Honestly, as I am writing this, I think the only reason I am giving it six stars is because of the nostalgia I have for the genre."
"This is a must-see movie for everybody who enjoys historically accurate WW2 movies.When I left the cinema I felt relief. Relief that Hollywood can still make decent movies that are not over the top full with either special effect candy or tear-jerking melodrama.This movie combines the two without losing sight of the narrative. You get moving personal stories but also the strategy and planning behind the moves in what is the biggest theater of war the world has ever seen.You not only see the battle like in Pearl Harbour but all the events leading up to Midway. You see the sailors but also the planners. You see aerial dog fights but also the backroom preparations, the code breakers that made it all possible.I don't know why this movie is slammed by critics. I find it better than Dunkirk and Pearl Harbour. It's a solid 9 out of 10 even if you don't like history movies so much. My guess is that the fact that there were no flying carriers, no Nazi mutants and Captain America didn't wear a shield played a significant role in the reviews of 6 and below.Go see it, you won't be disappointed. (unless you're looking for any of the above :))"
"The good:-Uniform and equipment accuracy was absolutely on point throughout the movie with exception of the Doolittle Raiders scenes. Everything down to the incredibly early war MkII USN goggles were featured.
-The physical aircraft mockups were very well done and, from what I've been told, the TBD mockup was even donated to the USS Midway museum.
-The sound design was fantastic and very immersive. Not as amazing as Dunkirk but deserves props nonetheless.
-There were a lot of little historical nuances that they nailed including the historical timeline leading up to the battle. Other, eve smaller, things appeared such as Halsey having shingles, Gaido's heroic action at the Marshall Islands, the Japanese wargames, etc.
-Some very memorable scenes. Everything involving Nimitz, Layton, and the codebreakers was fantastic. The Japanese scenes were all very well done as well.The bad:-The writing, oh the writing. It really feels like this was written by a film school student. The dialog was stiff and wooden along with the cookie cutter characters. While they represented real people, the film mostly made up their personalities with exception of a couple. The entire film was very disjointed and jumped around constantly and featured many scenes that served almost no purpose whatsoever. There were also scenes and characters that would appear randomly but we would never go back to them thus leaving the audience hanging with no follow through. While historically ""neat"" to see, they could have cut the Arizona scenes at Pearl Harbor, all of the Doolittle scenes and all of the Nautilus scenes. Honestly the whole way they lead up to Midway was a mess. They tried to cover too many events and, in doing so, was a master at none of them. In my opinion, they should made the first half an espionage thriller leading up to the battle rather than trying to spoon feed and explain/show the entire first year of the war in the Pacific.-Animations. While the CGI itself was very good, the animations were not. Many of the aircraft maneuvers made zero actual sense. For example, the Pearl Harbor scenes featured Kate torpedo bombers dropping torpedoes from high altitude and parallel, not perpendicular, to the ships they were targeting. I'll be entirely honest in saying that the aerial combat was better in Pearl Harbor than this. Pearl Harbor gets a lot of hate but one thing it did well was blending real aircraft with CGI and making a rather believable air combat scene. The attack by B-26s annoyed me as well as those should have been B-17s, not B-26s. There were only four B-26s in the attack and they were all low level torpedo bombers.-Acting. Well only about half of it. Nimitz, Layton, Halsey, the Japanese, and others were well acted. However a majority of the USS Enterprise cast seemed like a sequel to the Newsies with all the fake New York and Jersey accents. A lot of that goes back to the bad writing.Overall the film was clearly made more to be a action blockbuster than a historical war film. In the former it did well, I'd give it a 9/10 if I were to watch it as a action blockbuster. As a historical war film, it's a 6/10. I'd definitely still recommend seeing it and I'll definitely still buy it but it could have been much better."
Don't waste your time. Pure 1940's U.S. war propaganda.
"Am I missing something here? There was NO combat scenes, just ridiculous dialogue between unknown actors. It was a total waste of time. Worse war movie ever made."
"Not accurate on some (many?) intelligence details. No accounting for the sinking of the ""Lady Lux."" It actually sank after fuel leaks from the already crippled ship filled areas of the carrier with fumes and a generator sparked an explosion. After it was abandoned, the vessel sank from torpedoes intentionally fired by a American destroyer sent her to the bottom. Nimitz wasn't happy. The ""sleeping giant"" quote has long been considered suspicious and added nothing to the movie. The debate between Hypo and Neget (not recognized by name) deserved more attention. Several other things were problematic, but you get the idea.More soap opera scenes than I expected from other reviews. They added little, or nothing, to the story.The only reason I gave it a 5 rating was the new technology for the war scenes was interesting. I wish they wouldn't jump around so much and so fast with the angles, though.If they had followed the way Tora! Tora! Tora! was done, I could rate it higher. My suggestion is to read Layton's book, And I Was There, instead. More time to do so, but better spent for substance and understanding and more interesting."
"I was all set to go see this movie on Veterans Day weekend.
However, after watching the preview clip, I had second thoughts about going.
First, it shows twin-engine Japanese bombers bombing the US carriers at Midway.
They look like Mitsubishi 3GM ""Nell.""
Although in service with the Imperial Japanese Navy from 1935-1945, they were land, not carrier-based aircraft.
The closest Japanese-held airbase for them to take off from would have been at Wake Island.
With a range of some 2,400 miles, the could have flown the 2,054 nautical miles from Wake to Midway and back, with 346 miles to spare.
However, Wake's airfield at that time would have been too small to handle a large number of land-based twin-engine aircraft.
Moot point, though, none of the histories of the battle I've read (books, not unsubstantiated web sites) report the presence of land-based Imperial Japanese Navy bombers."
This movie is not good. But for some reason very watchable. The acting is not good and the effects are not good due to low budget but it is like enjoyable bad
"A plain dull movie with so many amazing actor speaking their line with zero emotion.terrible CGI that the fire and plane look so fake that hurt my eyes so badly.
Ed skrein terrible acting.As a leader,not a shown of remorseful after your man die because of u.Same acting in Deadpool, magnificent and Alita."
"Too boring for a war movie!
Waste of time, i would not recommend this to no one.
Pearl harbor was a great movie but this is a cheap replica."
"This movie is confused. It's an exploration of the conflict between American and Japanese forces in the Pacific from primarily the American perspective and yet the movie has nearly half of its budget coming from Chinese backers. I don't generally care where the money comes from on these movies but in this case I feel like it might have something to do with the confusion.We get a lot of time on both the American and Japanese sides of things with the Americans often treated like the clumsy buffoons who accidental themselves into victories while the Japanese have the superior force and skill yet suffer from sheer rotten luck. Which is maybe how it really happened, I don't pretend to know, but it doesn't film well.That alone wouldn't kill it, but clumsy plot movements don't help and neither does an unnecessary number of underdeveloped characters. Couple that with a firm jaunt into the uncanny valley with the effects and this movie is a mess. Too much of the budget must have gone to the cast and not to the finishing touches on the visuals because there are times planes are crashing into the ocean and it looks like an AR effect I could get on my phone.Weirdly, despite all of that, I didn't hate this movie, it just wasn't very good and a surprisingly disappointing theatre experience."
"I saw the trailer for this war movie a few times, I knew from the cast and it being directed by Roland Emmerich (Independence Day, The Day After Tomorrow, White House Down) that I wasn't going to miss it at the cinema. Basically, a few years before the start of World War II, at a state function on Tokyo, the US and Japanese positions in the Pacific Ocean are discussed. Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto (Etsushi Toyokawa) quietly informs intelligence officer Edwin T. Layton (Patrick Wilson) that they will take action if their oil supplies are threatened. On the morning of December 7, 1941, the Japanese strike at Pearl Harbor. The attack leads the US to enter World War II. Admiral Chester W. Nimitz (Woody Harrelson) assumes command of the badly damaged US Pacific Fleet following a shake-up. Layton speaks with Nimitz over his failure to convince Washington of the impending attack on Pearl Harbor. Nimitz tells him to stick to his guns in the next battle with Washington so a repeat surprise attack can be avoided. In April 1942, following the Doolittle Raid, the Japanese turn their attention to the Coral Sea. Joseph Rochefort (Brennan Brown, from the Orange Wednesday adverts) and his cryptology team have been intercepting messages concerning the Japanese and their next planned attacks. Layton disagrees with Nimitz, who believes the next target to be in the Aleutians, believing the intended target to be Midway Atoll. After meeting with Rochefort, Nimitz instructs the team to find a way to definitively prove that the next target is Midway. Cryptologists working for Rochefort intercept Japanese communications concerning water shortages and thus confirm that it is Midway next. In preparation for an ambush of the Japanese fleet, Nimitz has carriers Hornet and Enterprise recalled from the Coral Sea and demands that the damaged Yorktown be made ready for combat operations within 72 hours. On June 4, the Japanese launch an air attack against Midway. Initial attempted aircraft strikes fail, and no carriers are damaged. Nautilus, a US submarine, successfully locates and attacks an enemy carrier but the torpedo misses its target. Admiral Chuichi Nagumo (Jun Kunimura) gorders the Arashi to keep the submarine pinned down so that the carriers can escape. Meanwhile, US carrier planes are launched to destroy the Japanese carriers, but it is discovered they have moved from their last known location. Upon spotting the Arashi, the Commander of the Air Group (CAG) of the Enterprise, C. Wade McClusky (Luke Evans) has his planes follow the course of the Japanese destroyer, which is rushing back to the main Japanese fleet. Meanwhile, Admiral Nagumo learns of the presence of the US fleet and orders his men to rearm his planes for the anti-ship attack. US carrier-based planes abruptly appear, and Japanese planes combined with evasive manoeuvres initially keeps the carriers safe. However, Enterprise squadron commanders C. Wade McClusky and Richard 'Dick' Halsey Best (Ed Skrein) successfully lead their planes through the anti-aircraft fire and destroy the Japanese carriers Kaga and Akagi, and squadrons from the Yorktown destroy the Soryu. Tamon Yamaguchi (Tadanobu Asano), commanding the Hiryu, attempts to salvage the battle by rallying the remaining Japanese aircraft for an assault against the US carriers. The Japanese locate the Yorktown, bombing and disabling the carrier. Returning to the Enterprise, Best is told that about half of his squadron is either missing or destroyed. Informed that there is a surviving Japanese carrier, Best rallies what pilots he can and sets off to attack the Hiryu. The Japanese fail to stop the attack, and Best scores a critical hit that destroys the Hiryu. Raymond Spruance (Jake Weber), informed of the destruction of the last Japanese carrier, decides to withdraw rather than press his luck. Informed of the loss of his carriers in battle, Admiral Yamamoto orders his fleet to withdraw from the battle, thus bringing the Battle of Midway to a close. In Pearl Harbor, Rochefort intercepts the Japanese order to withdraw and tells Layton, who then informs Nimitz and his staff of Yamamoto's decision to withdraw. Following the US victory in the Battle of Midway, the final text reveals the fates of various participants, as well as Japanese reprisals after the battle. Also starring Mandy Moore as Ann Best, Dennis Quaid as William 'Bull' Halsey, Aaron Eckhart as Jimmy Doolittle, Nick Jonas as Bruno Gaido, Alexander Ludwig as Roy Pearce, Luke Kleintank as Clarence Dickinson, Darren Criss as Eugene Lindsey and Geoffrey Blake as John Ford. Wilson is very good as a naval intelligence officer, Harrelson chews the scenery well, and there are good performances from Skrein, Evans and Quaid. As you would expect from the director, the film is loaded with special effects as planes, ships and submarines blow things up, it covers the Battle of the Coral Sea and obviously the titular Battle of Midway well enough, it is perhaps more style over substance in terms of story, but you cannot deny for spectacle it is an immersive Second World War action drama. Worth watching!"
"The film's title was Midway. Too much time was spent on the attack of Pearl Harbor, the battle of the Coral Sea and Doolittle's Raiders. It did not leave enough time exploring the battle of Midway.Much of the drama of Midway was replaced by CGI. Which was wonderful to look at, but so much was missing. This should have been so much better.Mildly worth watching if you don't get too hung up on what's not in the movie and just enjoy what is."
"Seen in theater yesterday, I was entertained. Visually this movie is stunning, great effects, excellent CGI. Not a moment explosions or situations seemed uncanny. Cast is very solid with Patrick Wilson and Ed Skrein in the most important roles doing a very solid job. Story also solid to a certain point, but nothing special.BUT! This movie has a very high grade of propaganda playing of the US navy and army as nothing but almost angelic heroes and Japan being the devil. But my biggest complaint is when the movie ends en they do a recap about what happened after this battle... the atrocious way the US ended this war with Japan isn't even a footnote, it's all about hallelujah-ing the US soldiers and how they eventually killed a couple of Japanese big wigs that were involved in this war later in the war... really shame on the producers to make it seem like it never happened."
"This is a must watch for all families. These brave men ranged from 14 to 20 to fight for the Nation of their Ancestors and Forefathers, The United States of America. This movie makes me truly appreciate of The Greatest Generation. Must Watch, Must See, Must Tell Their Story. We must thank these Veterans every time we see them, thank them and ther families. We may not agree with these reasoning for going to war but we MUST support these brave men for fighting for America. We can never thank them enough, but we Must Honor each and everyone of them. From Bunker Hill, to The Battle of New Orleans, to the Mexican-American War, to Gettysburg, to the allowed attack of Pearl Harbor, to Korea, Vietnam, Somali, Iraq, Afghanistan, and Syria. Honor Them.
U.S.A. U.S.A U.S.A U.S.A. U.S.A.Another Review From A Black Womans Perspective."
"The movie is pretty decent from an historical perspective and the battle scenes are well done. There is a refreshing lack of romantic subplot as well as the emphesis that intelligence played.
The CGI comes and goes, and is distractingly terrible in some spots. The acting is generally not great and clunky and lead actor's contrived accent is downright grating. Woody harrloson is the bright spot.
The movie also touches on the Doolittle raid, which is only tangentaly related to the battle, mostly the aftermath , the scenes in China seem to be added purely for the Chinese financial backing."
"Good movie but hard to understand the course of events.
Recommend watching Midway (1976) to see the big picture of events first to understand what's happening."
"I'm just coming home from the cinema, Midway is worth to see, but the filmakers used a bit too mutch CPI, sometimes you feel like watching a Medal of Honor game trailer."
"Enjoyed the naval aviation history but I felt something was missing to make it more than 6. Also, the Japanese attack on the US carrier was not depicted."
"I am not on the positive flow line of many users, in fact, i made special this account so i could write a review.Maybe the film is historic correct, but qua entertainment it was not that great. The special effects were poor. You could clearly see the bad quality and the effects of green screen. They also kinda overdid it with special effects.The actors were also not that great. But i have to say i do not like the charisma of these characters in other movies too. I love Woody Harrelson, but also he coudnt safe this movie and bring a little bid of excitement.. This movie is then also not exciting!The story is okay... it is just a little boring. Half-way you already get this feeling you no longer really care if USA wins or the Japan. There is no root or event you wanna pick a side. Its like waiting for a stoplight. When is the movie over and you can move on with your life."
Garbage. very weak. Shame. A poor portrayal of interesting events.
"Too much PH. Took too long to get to the point. Enjoyed seeing the actors, however. Good theatrical makeup efforts."
"You won it today, it is tomorrow history. Casualty and life cost it all. Midway certainly ride up to meet my expectations. Nothing would go wrong in making WWII with today's special effects in the movie industry. Adversely, not necessarily one would succeed in making futuristic scifi movie back in the 70s to 80s. Simply put we knew history more so than we knew whats lies in the future.
In my opinion the highlight should be the dog fight, especially the bullet traces from the cockpit really great! I do not think any movie has done it this good. In the heart of the movie delivered a very fast phase but i bet you will stay on track and follow right through it. It is an American propagada to win the war but certainly this does not make the other look bad. I salute Japanese patriotism towards the end. If this was Japanese film, i am sure there will be an equal if not less, war heroes and kamikaze pilots added to show case.
If you like Pearl Harbor, you guarantee will like Midway!"
"Watch and don't talk while watching the movie
Everything is nice in this movie"
"It was a decent and entertaining movie. It carried most of the highlights of the actual events pretty well. A good portion of the air combat scenes were laughably bad, however. They treated SBD's as if the they were part fighter part dive bomber. Never actually mentioning there were actual fighters on the US side that participated in the battle. Still worth a watch though."
"Through much of this, my title was going to be Now THAT'S a War Movie, but they stumbled at the end and lost a couple of rating stars in the process. This movie is almost the direct opposite of Midway (1976), an embarrassing soap opera which nonetheless eventually gets around to telling a slam bang story of the battle. In contrast, the lead up to the Midway showdown here was done handsomely and efficiently through a few characters. Unfortunately, once they got there the narrative got rather tangled and the CGI, to that point comfortably restrained, became comically, unbelievably overdone.
So I was very excited going into the final stretch and then pretty much disappointed. On the casting side Skrein was the rather animated and odd looking but an eventually effective star as ace Enterprise pilot. Evans was okay as the tense McClusky, although without much depth. Moore is always good and fit well as Skrein's wife, and Toyokawa as Yamamoto was exceptional. Harrelson as Nimitz was just poor casting but Quaid as Halsey was almost believable. Eckhardt as Doolittle was a better fit if a good half foot taller than his character.
So I would say very well done in many aspects. partly spoiled by overdoing the key moments in the climactic battle."
"While it is flashy and cinematically correct (that's a back handed way of saying technically appealing), there are none the less two things wrong with this version of history...maybe I should have said 'problems', for the first is CGI. This vehicle can do some amazing things when showing fantasy worlds, but here they forgot to pay attention to how planes actually fly. The attempt in this movie was to make amazing battle scenes, but they didn't impress me.The second problem is you and me...we sometimes forget that there were real people fighting and dying over the four days of the battle. It's only my opinion certainly, but I could not empathize at all with some of the portrayals. Yes I'm gona say it; Woody Harrelson should never have been cast as Chester Nimitz...!In summary, I didn't like it...yes I'm a Navy veteran too..."
"The CG is absolutely amazing, but suggest get to know the history in advance."
"I won't talk from the plot story side because they are show how big the loyalty from the citizen (Army).After watching this movie, i just know the truth, oh okay thats why both Japan and USA can to be a super power country."
This is way better than the version with Henry Fonda. It covers a lot of ground in a hurry related to context and then focuses on the American offense during the battle of Midway.I do not know how the USA won that battle. The odds were stacked against us more than Miracle on Ice in 1980.It's a must see!
"Here is another example of the emphasis on cgi over character development. The cgi effects in this film are great. You really get the feeling of being a dive bomber pilot. It would make a great video game. But not a movie. The character development is really sparse. What's even worse, some of the major issues surrounding the battle are neglected. The change in the Navy from ships to planes was a major struggle at the time. It's never mentioned. Torpedo planes were a new technology and very controversial. Barely a mention. The discord in Washington between the European and the Pacific emphasis is never mentioned, nor even alluded to. The discord within the Japanese is the only thread given attention."
"The CGI battle scenes are amazing, actually too amazing.The film relies heavily on CGI action scenes. In between are scences of cardboard 2d characters. It doesn't create any suspense, or drama .A fabricated scene, where captured U.S. aviators are thrown overboard by the Japanese to 'tell' where the U.S. carriers are.With all the individual incidents that happened during the battle, the writers could only come up with some trite crass garbage - lazy storytelling.That sums up this film. It wasn't terrible, just totally unremarkable except to say, good CGI.Was it worth the price of a cinema ticket? No.Would I watch this again ? No.The 1976 film with Charlton Heston was actually better .The plethora of gushing 10/10 best war film ever, as per every new release, convicnces me studios are paying for 10/10 reviews"
"Most of them don't age well, are hard to relate to, and look and feel outdated .Not so in this case .
The original film from 1976 can teach this new version a thing or two .
Well, make that everything .As stilted and wooden the older movie might be at times, it delivers a credible portrayal of naval warfare, and might even be historically correct .This new movie is a mediocre compilation of best-of, seen a 1000 times before scenes of that infamous battle, devoid of depth, accuracy and loaded with shallow stereotypes .It looks good at times, but at no point is it involving, like the original was ."
"First off, I read the reviews and actually reluctantly saw this film. Hollywood never does remakes good. Well, they didn't here either. There are actually no big name actors at all in this movie, nobody!!!!! The acting was terrible, the script was horrible. Campy lines throughout the movie. The only decent thing in the movie was the action scenes. That's it. They say that this one battle at Midway was the turning point of the war with Japan, well, it happened in 1942, the war didn't end until 1945. Do the math. This movie played out like a sad propaganda film. And could someone please educate Hollywood with how to salute properly please. I'm a Navy veteran and it pains me to see these actors salute improperly. It's a small thing but it means a lot to people who salute professionally. If you haven't seen the original Midway, take a look. Major stars in that movie. I just can't believe Hollywood couldn't get anyone to do this movie. Obviously those agents knew to say no to this terrible script. All these reviews 8's 9's even 10's, what movie were they watching?????? Let's put it this way, one of the points they make in this film features Nick Jonas, that's a serious red flag in my book. Don't say I dint warn you."
"In retaliation for the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, the Americans call for a devastating counter-attack to go down in American history ... In keeping with the tradition that patriotic American films are always staged by foreigners, the native Swabian and American election Roland Emmerich once again this challenge. What kind of cuddly heroes are these Americans, who defend their country to the utmost! Of course it's a true story, and it's not the first adaptation of this glorious American victory over the Japanese during the Second World War. But why is Emmerich warming up this material for the cinema right now? Political calculus? Quite conceivable."
"Midway is a great movie! The foreground of Midway is great the viewer got the feel of the Japanese war machine, and how Imperial Japan works. The intelligence community failures is displayed for Pearl and the character development of the U S characters proceeds as the movie progress. The Navy and the characters are perfectly created we the viewer, experience what the command structure and characters in the film. How strong the wives are. The confidence of a leader/ pilot has to be in-order to survive. Either do it or bounce off the Carrier. The command structure has to be trusting, yet strong. The middle of the movie is historically accurate. One experiences how military intelligence is a must for war. Many decision are made on educated gambles. If one did not know about World War 2 in the this film educates about Pacific Pear Harbor to Midway perfectly; The special effects are realistic! One experiences the nerve, and chaos of warfare, and the part with the brave pilot who hit two Carriers is memorable. The conclusion is great. One sees how luck, military mistakes, and listening to good intelligence is a must for battles. Midway is a well acted, directed, and executed. Much better than the original 1975 Midway, which side stories slowed the film. A must see. 9 stars."
"In the beginning the characters seemed a little bit odd especially Dick Best, but by the end of the movie I was on the edge of my seat screaming for Dick to come through. So it took a little bit but I eventually connected with Dick in a powerful way. Quite possibly the best movie I've seen this year."
"The plot, scenes, actors...etc. were quite amazing till the end where all America, Americans and American related stuff have been praised in such unbelievable ways that even the Japanese would believe the Americans were the victims, they were all heroes and bla bla...
This is a war movie. It has to be objective. Both sides have lost men, suffered and had horrific experiences. There was just no need to bless the Americans who knew they would never win in a fair war (so, they used nucleae weapon instead) nd degrade the Japanese. Alas, let's not talk about Hiroshima, after all!"
"From my perspective and study of the Battle of Midway, this movie is very accurate in many of its portrayals of events. Having studied the maps of Pearl Harbor myself, I can see how the movie crew got this as accurate as possible.The intelligence reports and suppositions of the intelligence officers were very much questioned by their superiors because the information was based on ""new technologies"" for gathering and studying the information. Thank God, Admiral Nimitz listened to the reports and acted upon them.Having only witnessed the battle from the brief films of John Ford, I can only imagine (as did the screenwriters) the scope and horror of the battle.My only question about the movie is, Why did most of the male cast members in major roles have the same jaw-clenching expression on their faces? To me, the only distraction in a very accurate depiction of the events leading up to and the Battle of Midway."
"This film was very well done and the two hours went by so fast. No fake love interest in this movie or any person of color getting a cameo or being a token was represented. The only negative, the pilots did not go from carrier to Hawaii as often as it was shown. These pilots were at sea for 3/4 of the war, not going back home and hitting the officers club every other week as portrayed. Overall, the film is very good. This should be shown to all high school students so that they know and understand what WWII is about. The schools hardly teach this any longer."
"Woody Boyd cannot be Admiral Nimitz. And Skreil was pathetic/awful/disaster as a ""cocky"" kid from NJ. Go back to fantasies and comic books where authenticity is not expected.Other than that, good story, and pretty accurate historically (omitted a few important things). Pearl Harbor, Coral Sea, and Midway were about the aircraft carriers and the power that they would have later, and this is the first time a movie tied it all together.Would love to see a redo with the casting executives from Band of Brothers in charge. Maybe Hanks directing the conversation shots. If that happens my rating goes from 5 to 9."
"Aspired to be an equal to ""Tora! Tora! Tora!"" or ""Battle of Britain"" but fell far short. Will soon be forgotten. Nice CGI, though, but since it was extensively used maybe the contributions of the B-17's, PBY's, TBD's, F4F's, F2A's, TBF's, B-26's and SB2U's could have been shown more fully. The SBD was far from the only type that took part."
"I found this movie hard to follow. The editing was confusing to me jumping between multiple locations without it being clear who is who and how it all fit together. It felt to me that there were critical scenes missing to make the film work. It didn't help that for me many actors looked very similar and I often struggled figuring out who is who and what their roles were. The acting also felt off to me - there were too many missed opportunities for some strong dialogue, which was replaced with dialogue that I did not find very engaging."
"This was honestly awful. Hard for me to believe this was a supposed passion project for Roland Emmerich because it does not show. The special effects in Pearl Harbor, made almost 20 years ago, still hold up but the effects in this, one of the most expensive independent films ever made, are utter dog crap. The film never hooks you, I was completely disengaged and bored. It looked like a straight to video cheap knock off. Bad on just about every level... I couldn't even finish it. I've only ever walked out of a film once or twice before."
"MIDWAY REVIEWThe US is caught on the back foot after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.The Japanese are better equipped; the American fighter planes are creaky crates, and their torpedoes have all the destructive power of conkers.But this macho war film argues the US had one thing in its favour: its men.All the most enormous, jutting, chiselled chins in Hollywood are called up to do their duty, and armed with lines of dialogue that sink like depth charges.In fairness, the priorities in this account of the Battle of Midway are the admittedly impressive aerial battle sequences, which are great, featuring numerous gut-churning plunges as the US pilots dive-bomb the enemy ships.Of course there is the usual cowboy / reckless flyboy who saves ther day and Woody Harrelson dons a silver wig and an expression of noble fortitude as Admiral Chester Nimitz.Every tired war movie cliche is unearthed in a film that brings nothing new but will no doubt please fans of men in uniform yelling at explosions.In essance very long, very drawn out, the historical accuracy forgotten, acting ropey in places, confusing at times but well made up for by the scenes of the destruction of Pearl Harbour, the true cost of war and the aerial battles.Dont waste your time and money in the cineam for this outing, wait for it to come on TV or streaming.Rating 6 out of 10"
"Great movie and acting, only negative was no mention of the atomic bombing afterwards, which would've been nice to see..."

"Great Visuals
Average Script
Average ActingIs not necessary to take on the bad side on MIDWAY as this movie is all about enjoying the special effects and roll up eyes shaking heads in every movie/history clichÃ©s it come up.If you want history accuracy go to a documental and/or a book and discuss that with friends; if you want to get your popcorn refill and explain to someone where was the Japanese Empire and what was Free China and the importance of the Aircraft carriers in the sea warfare go with your kids as a 101 of history, you may have a good time explaining who is who.Go to the movies to see this one and dont worry getting your popcorn refill.RegardsÂ´
SPOILERS-------------JAPAN loose all their 4 carriers."
"Roland does it again with a surprising cast. One of the best films in regards to this subject, and the history is spot on. This is a film you want to take your kids to see to teach them about WWII, something they won't learn in school. It's a teaching moment. Go see it today."
Finally saw a real epic war movie. There is no drama that has been tampered with for the sake of political correctness. But I heard that the biggest investor is Chinese. Is this a Hollywood tragedy?
I really enjoyed this movie which is based on true life events.
"There is too much Pearl Harbor, Dolittle Tokyo bombing mission, etc. The whole thing should be on Midway and the intricacies of Japan's military strategy and US counter measures. They should also cast someone else for Admiral Nimitz's role because Woody Harrelson is, albeit a great actor, just not convincing in the Nimitz role. Japan's failure is not only attributable to our code breakers, according to history, and that failure should be expounded in more detail in this movie. Anyways, it was still entertaining because nowadays visual effects are so real and the big screen just enhances everything. I give it 6 stars but it certainly could have been better made..."
"I loved this movie, I finished watching it and just said wow...."
"I understand some writers, directors, and actors take liberties when making historical representations, and I'm OK with how most of this movie was done. The part that bothered me was the super-obvious CGI. There were parts where CGI was not necessary, but used anyway, like the scene where sailors are exercising on-deck and it looks ""cartoonish"". There were several times where I felt they were going to go completely CG and remove the actors during speaking parts. Luckily, I did not detect any of that.Overall, the movie was decent for a Hollywood representation of sea battles. If you're not a history buff, you'll probably need to do a little study to understand some of the more significant contributions from some of the people represented in the movie.The acting was superb -- even the parts that were sensationalized."
"This move had an excellent cast and script. Special effects made it feel real without being overdone. The best part was learning how this battle could have been disastrous without the hard work, gutts, and determination of the pilots, soldiers, and codebreaks working together in tandem. I love that there are no saccharin romances or politics in this move. Go see it."
"I will preface this by saying that I very much enjoyed this movie, but I think that it had significant weaknesses.For a film ostensibly about Midway, it spent an awful lot of its runtime covering Pearl Harbor and the Doolittle Raid (yet oddly almost none on the Battle of the Coral Sea). This seemed to lead into an awful lot of foreshortening and simplification of Midway itself.With that being said, it was well-paced, with good performances, and covered a lot of the essentials well. Details such as the ""water"" message from Midway were well-placed, as were refernces to the well-known shortcomings of the Bliss-Leavitt Mk XIII aerial torpedo (""clunk""), and the TBD Devastator torpedo bomber (although in the actual battle the USN had 6 of the newer, faster, better armed and armoured TBF Avengers and lost 5 of those, so it wasn't just the planes).I was surprised to see comparatively little involvement depicted of the fighters in the actual battle, and I think that not enough explanation was given of the US Navy's plan for coordinated aerial attacks with torpedo bombers at low level, dive bombers from high level with fighter cover provided by the F4Fs, and importantly why that didn't happen and its devastating conseuences in terms of the virtual annihilation of the torpedo squadrons.In all, I think it was a good film that simply tried to cover too much historical ground in too short a time. For all that, I enjoyed it and would recommend it as a good war movie."
"I am awed by how great this film is!! It is actio packed, acting was flawless, the director, cast and crew did a magnificent job."
"In my opinion, Midway is a good movie but what I don't like is about the CGI, it's suck comparing to Pearl harbor in 2001."
"I liked the story of DICK BEST ....and if he actually dove so low and was able to get his altitude back then more praise to him...When the Japanese Admiral said something about our brave pilots with bad airplanes sounded like someone just threw that into the script, I highly doubt any enemy would say that."
"The movie shows you what World War 2 is like, I know you have seen it through Saving Private Ryan, and Dunkirk, and Midway is no different. Showing both sides of World War 2 of the americans and the Japanese, and makes us understanding both sides very well.
Action scenes are pretty intense, and give you quite the experience of making you feel like the pilots in the plane. And the effects are pretty good also. The all star cast perform well too, from Woody Harrelson to Patrick Wilson, even Mandy Moore, and Dennis Quaid. The movie does slow down a bit, and may get a little boring. But when it picks up it really picks up."
"I was really sceptical about watching this film after the awful Pearl Harbour movie. But i was pleasantly surprised how good it was after reading a few negative reviews. The film covers a lot more than just Midway. It starts many years prior to the second world war and lead up to Midway it shows Pearl Harbour and the Doolittle raid on Japan.Some of the dialogue is a bit corny but that is few and far between and is overshadowed by the brilliant CGI. Woody Harrelson is the stand out for me but there are other good performances from a strong cast.Overall its well worth going to the pictures to watch it,"
But I still rated it a 9 because everyone should see it to be reminded what people gave to protect the country others are working to bring down.
"In the most part I really enjoyed this film. The graphics are amazing and it really Kris good pace with a good view on the events from both sides, with a little bit of Hollywood license thrown in, which I don't mind too much.What let's it down a little is some of the acting. Maybe it is done to appeal more to the American audiences but some of the 'All American Hero' over acting is cringe worthy and laughable at times.But don't let that put you off, this is a good film done in the old style and is well worth a watch."
"I do not often watch war films. I do not study military history. Therefore, it is difficult to evaluate the film's vision from this point of view. The acting is magnificent, the plot is smooth: there is a beginning, a climax and an ending. The only difficulty is a lot of characters. However, the characters are surprisingly open and their development is visible. It is worth to see this film."
"Let me start by saying that whilst there are a few rather cringey ""Hollywood"" moments with the dialogue and one or two action scenes, overall it will go down as an excellent and largely accurate depiction of the battle. But we don't only see the ferocity of Midway itself, we're given the build-up to the War in the Pacific plus depictions of the Pearl Harbor attack and the follow up engagements between the Japanese and American forces. This was important in setting the stage for the main event as it were.Turning to the special effects briefly. The CGI is absolutely mind blowing, as would be expected from an Emmerich film of this nature. I could not get over the attention to detail of the ships, aircraft, firepower and landscapes rendered. Simply magnificent. To my mind there's never been a more, dare I say it, ""beautiful"" depiction of war in the Pacific. It really raises the bar to a height I dont think will be surpassed for a long time in movies of this genre.Another very important aspect of war films for me is how ""the enemy"" are portrayed and to be fair the Japanese aren't painted in simple-minded, propagandistic terms. They are mostly shown as the brave and thinking airmen and naval personnel we know they were. At one point for example Yamamoto mentions how the oil embargo on Japan is leaving the country with no option BUT war. Again this is important in a historical context, especially as so many people these days are ignorant of the past (not saying i'm an expert on it of course!). We know that Japanese forces did indeed commit many atrocities, against Allied troops but more especially against the Chinese population and other Asian civilians under their occupation, so it's good that these are highlighted at various points in the film too."
The movie was good but without giving depth to the characters. Action science was great cinematography also..but it is not Saving privet Ryan kind. There was lots of characters and events that needed more focus..maybe the movie will come up better if they gave some focus to it. The director is master of big destruction movies over all I give it 7.5/10
"Midway Is an WWII war movie made by action blockbuster writer/director Roland Emmerich (Independents Day,2012, Godzilla and The Day After Tomorrow). Emmerich is known for his dazzling special effect and this film does not disappoint.
The film portrays the events that led up to the turning point of the War in the Pacific ""The Battle of Midway"".
I have read that this version of the story is more historical accurate than the 1976 Charleston Heston classic. The film mainly follows two (real life) American soldiers, pilot Lt. Dick Best (Ed Skrein) who led his dive bomber squadron at Midway, and intelligence officer Lt. Comm. Edwin Layton (Patrick Wilson) who with his code-breaker team predicted the Midway attack. The film also has other famous American soldiers: Admiral Chester Nimitz (Woody Harrelson) Commander in Chief of the US Pacific Fleet; Vice Admiral William ""Bull"" Halsey (Dennis Quaid) who led the aircraft carrier USS Enterprise; Rear Admiral Raymond Spruance (Jake Weber) who took over the Enterprise for the Battle of Midway; Best's fellow aviators Lt. Comm. Wade McClusky (Luke Evans), Lt. Comm. Eugene Lindsey (Darren Criss) and Lt. Comm. Jimmy Doolittle (Aaron Eckhart); cryptographer Commander Joseph Rochefort (Brennan Brown) and Aviation Machinist Mate Bruno Gaido (Nick Jonas).
The film moves quickly through the events in the early months of the War., from the attack on Pearl Harbor, to Doolittle's Raid on Tokyo (April 1942) and the Battle of Coral Sea (May 1942).
The side of the Japanese Imperial Army and their unique military culture were also given fair screen time in this film. Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto (Etsushi Toyokawa) of the Imperial Japanese Navy and the Commander in Chief of their combined fleet, was portrayed with calm and quiet dignity. We also get to meet other Japanese officers and their own brands of leadership Rear Admiral Tamon Yamaguchi (Tadanobu Asano) who commanded the Hiryu with nobility, and Vice Admiral Chuichi Nagumo (Jun Kunimura) whose controversial battle decisions had negative impact against the Japanese campaign.
As I said before the battle scene were fantastic, and the acting was top notch. May bestest complaint was how it jumped quickly from screen to screen and battle to battle. I would have also liked to see the Japanese counter attack that led to the destruction of the USS Yorktown, which was something the 1976 film did well. The Charleston Heston film is one of my favorite War films (even if it was not accurate). So this film had a lot to live up to, and it did! The film does have a 2 hour 18 minute run time (which is 6 minutes longer than the original). This is a PG film so there is no graphic violence, so it's fit for the whole family.
With this past weekend being Veterans Day, avoid the critics reviews, are check out a great movie."
This is a good one boys and girls. I will definitely see it again. My only complaint was the end dedication that included the Japanese sailors that were out to kill every last American they could. I'm not that PC I'm afraid.
"Historical films are always difficult to pull off, because history doesn't always fit into a nice Hollywood mold. This is a time period I've always been fascinated by, and Midway is a battle I've read extensively about over the years. This is a moment when the world as we know it would look very different if this battle had another outcome. So for me, it was important that the story be told accurately, as it is a pivotal point in the Second World War.Did they do that? Yes. The characters they show -- Best, McCluskey, Nimitz, Halsey, Doolittle, Yamamoto, Nagumo, Yamaguchi, Layton, Rocheford, et al, are all real. Unlike other Hollywood historical films (like Pearl Harbor), they didn't mung it up with fake characters and story in order to give some star screen time.Is the story accurate? Fundamentally yes. While there was some very minor conflation of supporting events, mostly for time, everything that unfolded is true, and I don't think there is anything shown that flat out did not happen (again like in Pearl Harbor).I thought the CGI work overall was excellent. It added to the story in the right way, and it was amazing to see them bring the Enterprise, Hornet, and Yorktown back to life. It was incredible to see those classic Dauntless's, Devastators, Mitchells, Zeros, Kates, and Marauders in the air again.I highly recommend seeing this movie. See it for the history, the story, and for the appreciation of the Greatest Generation. One thing that is undeniable, is that these guys had balls the size of coconuts."
"Quit reading these reviews and just go see this movie for yourself. Don't try and compare it to the war movies of the 60's and 70's, just let it stand on its own. Nit pickers are never satisfied and wanna-be film critics only know how to be critical.
You don't have to be a history nerd to keep up with the story of the battles that build up to the battle of midway, because they're explained by the characters. Is the majority of the backgrounds and battle scenes CGI? Yes! But after a while, the intense action makes you forget.
It seems as though some of the stories were taken straight from the History Channel documentary ""Battle 360"" on the USS Enterprise's role in WWII. Even some of the fighter scenes and dive bombings are reproduced in this film with uncanny similarities. But overall, this film is riveting at times and down right entertaining."
"I wish they could combine the 1976 Midway Movie with this one and then you'd have a great movie. Some of the special effects in this movie ( like the ships and dogfights) were really good,but many were ridiculous. The 1976 Midway movie and Tora Tora Tora used actual aircraft from the period and even with the WW2 footage scenes the attacks seemed more realistic than the 2019 movie. I thought Woody Harrelson was great as Chester Nimitz, He kind of looked like him. The Japanese acting was good also. I liked the 1976 movie better. It seemed more real. Tora Tora Tora will always be the best war movie. I wish they'd make a movie about the battle of the Atlantic off America's east coast. It's almost criminal they haven't made a movie about that . Can't ever show the Germans winning with this Hollywood."
