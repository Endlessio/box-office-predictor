"Most critics are missing the point of this movie - it's not supposed to be a ""Schindler's List."" Yes there are cliches,but some of them are cleverly wrapped cliches of cliches. There's some stuff that gets too silly, unless your 7, at which point his reaction (my son) adds even more to the entertainment value of the movie.
The bottom line is that my daughter, son and I went to the movie, had a great time. We've been quoting lines in the last couple of days and laughing at the memory, but we've also had some serious conversations about love and loss and family and taking care of each other - an experience far more valuable than the cost of the movie."
"It's not as bad as all the reviews on here say. It's a kids movie and my kids enjoyed it, that's all that really counts."
"Yes I agree this is not a movie for serious and especially older movie critics to go watch ðŸ˜‚ but this is a very Funny movie that the whole family will enjoy together. This is a simple movie with some natural human storyline, Not some aliens taking over The earth, or some Si-Fi movie that takes place in 2300. Do Not listen to these low reviews, Go watch with your kids and enjoy your time ðŸ˜‰"
"Not quite sure why all the negativity on this light-hearted, kid-friendly movie. I sure hope Americans aren't losing their sense of humor in all this political discourse constantly buzzing around us. I found Fire to be a thoroughly enjoyable 90-minute romp through the look of single men dealing with kids who have been caught in tragic circumstances. John Cena's portrayal of a bumbling lover/father figure was humorously delivered despite his hulking frame overpowering the physicality of all those around him. He's surrounded by an equally delightful crew, with special kiddos to Keegan-Michael Key, whose appearance in every frame elicited at least a chuckle from the audience.
Judging from the kids in the seats, Fire appeared to entertain everyone in the house. It's refreshing to see a film with not one swear word and non-adult over the top mature situations, save for two instances (there must be a Hollywood requirement that each movie contain at least two poopy scenes). Do yourself a favor and ignore the snobbish critics and go see this delightful comedy."
"If anyone reviews it as an adult movie, that is their mistake.There was no solid plot. It was mainly a bunch of funny scenes sewn together to make a plot. I saw two established actors I enjoy very much, Dennis Haysbert and Judy Greer. I was also introduced to another established actor I had not seen before, Keegan Michael Key. He was very funny. I would say he stole the movie. I was also introduced to a new actor, for whom I predict a bright career, if she stays with these ""good"" movies, Brianna Hildebrand."
"From my 7 year old ""It was one of the best movies ever and that I've ever seen in my life. The end was a little emotional and then it became a lot happier. Then it was over"""
"Simmer down you wannabe critics, this film was a blast! Sure it was a little infantile, but if you expected something dramatic and serious, then give yourself a 1/10, not this film!Directing and cinematography was great, as was the writing. The comedy was actually funny and entertaining, and presented perfectly by every actor (even the little ones). Casting was amazing - great to see some of my favorite funnymen Keegan-Michael Key and John Leguizamo. Pacing was perfect for the 96 min runtime. It's a well deserved and honest 8/10 from me"
"Playing With Fire is one of the greatest family movies I have ever seen! It is a family-friendly, feel-good movie with an important message - family is the most important thing to help you keep going. There is a lot of comedy in this movie that makes the audience laugh out loud.The story line is both adventurous and exciting. There is lots of action, but it is not violent. The characters are super funny and the acting is phenomenal! If I had to recommend any film to watch with friends and family, it would be this one. Some parts are sad, but there is also plenty of action and comedy to keep the audience engaged.Playing With Fire is about four smoke jumpers, which is an elite team of fire fighters. Jack and his friends are specially trained to jump into dangerous wildfires, so they can rescue people and fight fires. Their lives are perfect, until they find three kids trapped in a fire and this special group of men is forced to hang onto them until they can find their parents. Until then, they have to fight fires and take care of the kids. What could go wrong?The cast in this film is amazing! The casting director, Rich Delia, not only picked some big names to be in this film, but also found some talented new-comers. The whole cast portrays their characters really well and they are hilarious too! Superintendent Jack Carson, head of the smoke jumpers, is played by John Cena, a well-known actor and WWE wrestler. Keegan- Michel Key, a famous comedian, plays Lieutenant Mark, a friend of the Superintendent and another smoke jumper. Jack's soft-hearted friend, Rodrigo, is played by John Leguizamo. Brianna Hildebrand plays Brynn, the oldest of the three kids. This film also has a dog named Masher, that is Jack's fierce firehouse dog. Masher is very well trained and his interaction with the kids is hilarious. Andy Fickman directs the film.I give Playing With Fire 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 7 to 18, as well as adults . Reviewed by Eva W., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.

"Took my 11 year old to see this, and she loved it!For me, an adult, it was terrible. Some laughs, but poor acting, lame plot, and unbelievable characters. Plus, John Cena has his shirt off way too much! And the constant shelling for ""My Little Pony"" was wearisome. Only Keegan-Michael Key was semi-palatable, and that was only in two scenes. If you can drop your kids off, do so!"
"Didnt they just make this film like 5 years ago ?
and before that and before that and before that
I think the last one was Vin Disel as a nanny or something and then there was one with Jackie Chan as a spy next door and Arnold Schwarzenegger as the kindergarten teacher I think they just recycle this movie every five years with a different leading man
If your taking your grade schoolers they may like it everyone else will probably groan and play candy crush on their phone"
"John Cena is Jake Carson the Commander of a trio of Smoke Jumpers as they are less than 350 in the world and they are elite there. Keegan Michel Key as LT Mark who gave up an accountant job over being a smoke jumper, John Leguizamo is Rodrigo another soft hearted member as both have the comedy there. Taylor Mane as mute but kind Axe as he loves to carry an axe and wear the same yellow shirt.As three orphaned kids that escaped a cabin fire. And that the smoke jumpers have to watch them temporary until they can figure out what to do as they are on the run from Child's Protected Services.Jake is the son of a legendary jumper who sacrificed his life and he wants to be the man in charge as he also faces in the inspection of the main chief played by 24's and The Unit's Dennis Hayesbert there. To take his place when Hayesbert's retirement of his character.Jake tries to put up a tough front but his letting down his guard gets in the way. The two youngest kids a toddler that loves the firehouse dog Masher and the other youngest a boy who questions everything and is really smart. Brianna Hildebrand as Brynn as she is the oldest of the three trying to keep it togetherCute film and really do not at all listen to the critics. It is a great film to kickoff holiday season!"
"Bad acting, bad scrip, bad directing, it is so bad that John Leguizamo was not funny and he is a comedian. I would had given it 1 start but at least Keegan made me laugh."
"This is a meme! It's a a classic by Andy fickman! Full of poopies, my little ponies and John Cena's nipples. My 10/10 is a meme rating."
"Just wanted to post a quick note about this - I read an online review that complained only kids would like the movie, like it was aimed at adults (it's from Nickelodeon studio for heaven's sakes - who do you think it's aimed at?). My kids liked the look of the trailer and they absolutely loved the movie, period (my wife took them, I didn't go). This probably cost peanuts to make and even clearing just $10 million in its domestic opening week it's probably go to turn a profit."
"My 10 years old son laughed a lot and it was a nice family movie with a good value at the end , I recommend it for families that have toddlers and teenagers."
Best comedy of the year. Playing with fire has loads of laughs and fun action. It's a nice story and one if the funniest movies in recent years.
Playing with fire is an awesome movie. It is just a lot of fun with great performance. John Cena and Keegan-Michael Key are hilarious. Brianna Hidebrand is great. The most fun and laughs I had at the movies in a long time.
This was such a good surprise. I love walking away from a good family movie where all the kids are super happy about the movie. And the movie is CLEAN. No dirty jokes for the parents. Just some good old fashioned humour and great message. The people on here complaining about this movie are adults who went to see this without kids. Talking about no arch in the plot and no antagonist. Lol go watch batman if you want a villian to critic.
"This is one of the cringiest movies. the scenario and the acting was not that match. also, fire is so animation"
"At moments it can be annoying but not very often. It has a pretty good cast. Keegan Michel Key in particular is hilarious, John Cena and his Crew are pretty good, The kids and everyone else are pretty good too. But it lacks in emotion even though my sister cried. Overall a decent movie you SHOULD NOT take seriously and if you don't take it seriously you will have a good time."
"This has got to be the best family picture to come out in a long time not inc toy story 4 from the beginning it hits you with laughter and doesn't stop until the final 5 minutes
the kids are the best and you really warm up to them especially the little girl
as for potty humor there is some but not a lot
I haven't seen John Cena in a comedy before and I have to admit he is really good the huge guy with an axe is the most intimidating person i have ever seen and wouldn't want to ever mess with also John John Leguizamo adds a nice touch
all in all I don't understand who could really hate this type of movie and why it has a 4.4  it deserves higher much higher
and at the end it does have a nice message and wraps up putting a smile on your face glad i skipped the trailers and went for it"
"I took my 11 year old daughter on her birthday to see this. Yes, it had some previous movie cliches, and yes some of it was a tad corny. But isn't every good guy vs bad guy action movie or comic superhero cliche too? This movie had a good story, was family friendly, decent humor, and we loved it. It was intended for kids and families and I must say this father of 7 approves, and so did my daughter. 9/10 for us."
"Goofy, heart-warming, and a film that's appropriate to take small children to. It's a face-palm that almost every person who gives this movie a low rating notes that ""my kids LOVED it."" Since it IS a kids' movie, sounds like that's a mission-accomplished to me!"
"This was a perfect flick for my 8 year old grandson and I and my son liked it also. It was silly of course and that's what's funny to 8-year old kids. In case the critics are wondering, the target market is children. And for them and their families, this film was a home run."
"People saying there's no story? It's about 3 orphaned kids that run away from foster care because their parents died, and they found out they'd be separated right before the youngest sister's birthday. They get caught in a fire, then have to ride out a terrible rain storm with fire fighters (smoke jumpers).It was a fun movie, my 6 year old loved it. It reminded me of the Gameplan with the Rock. The overall meaning of the movie was good; look past it being a kids movie and just have fun."
"Plenty of adult humor that will fly over children's heads. My husband and I sat on the theater surrounded by kids and their parents. Entire theater was laughing. No one is winning an Oscar, but that's not the point. Just good clean fun and way better than the ctapfrst Last Christmas is."
The movie has it all. It is a great family movie that holds the attention of everyone... young or old. Lots of funny spots and some great life lesson moments. Definitely worth a watch.
"Not even worth rental on demand. A bunch of strung together slapstick gags none of which were funny at all. Too many scenes of John Cena taking his shirt off yet again to show off his physique. Not one second of originality. The ending was kind of sweet but even that was cliche. Probably the best description of the movie is a totally unfunny clichÃ©. I really think Hollywood has lost it completely, with some exceptions. The weird thing is this could've been a cool movie based on the concept of hotshot fire fighters that are in the news these days because of the California fires. It's an interesting subject but this is total and complete waste of time."
"Had the potential to be a good movie, but the acting was way too over the top, and downright bad. My 7 year old nephews loved it. I wasn't impressed and I usually like movies like this."
"This movie unfortunately barely had a storyline, no antagonist/villain, a lot of sleepy dialogue, and desperately needed many more fun hijinks moments between the kids and firefighters than it provided. Nearly every funny scene was shown in the trailer. Too many consecutive scenes in the movie were downright boring. The kids in the theatre hardly laughed. This is a hard pass if your looking for a real fun comedy for your kids."
Loved This Movie So Funny Really Enjoyed it This Movie Deserves A Lot Better
"LIKES:Funny
Fast Paced
Good Writing
Lots of Comedy Styles
Cute/Adorable
TouchingDISIKES:Predictable
Seems A Bit Rushed
Imbalance Of Styles
The Trailers Have Touched A LotThe VERDICT:If you've seen the trailers, you can pretty much expect what the trailers promised for this film. Playing With Fire is all about being a cute, straightforward film that will tickle the fancy of the young and young at heart. Within its family friendly environment comes writing that feels like a 90s sitcom/drama, filled with diverse comedy styles and touching moments to get the warmth of the holidays in. While this is all expected though, for movie scoring it would have been nice if the film could have burst out of the straight track and twisted into something better. It's predictably and rushed storytelling sort of cheated me out of a complete picture, while the lack of more adult based humor will potentially bore others who have outgrown the family friendly humor. Finally, the fact this movie falls victim to trailer syndrome will further dilute the experience. This film is worth a trip for the families, but in terms of special effects and overall picture, this could have done well on straight to cable release.My scores are:Comedy/Family: 7.0
Movie Overall: 5.0"
"I took my 5yr old daughter to see this. I did not go into this movie thinking I was going to see some amazing acting. I watched this movie with the knowledge that my daughter would find it funny and sweet. This movie isn't the greatest. But it does have a great moral, sometimes work isn't everything it's about family and heart."
"Good entertaining movie for the whole family. Usually parents have to suffer through movies with their kids but this one was pretty enjoyable for everyone. Great seeing Keegan Michael Key, John Leguizamo and Judy Greer too."
"The only bad thing about it was the various MLP:FiM references in a lot of the scenes. The major plot twist was revealed in a scene where the 3 kids were revealed to be runaway orphans. I really enjoyed John Cena's part in this movie where he cries. Thank god this film premiered instead of what was originally going to be, one of the biggest failures in movie adaptation history. I hope it gets a sequel in the future."
"I think John Cena is one of the most overrated actors on planet Earth. But, I generally don't care to criticize because a lot of his movies are for kids and families where the bar is set a little lower. But man, even for a kids movie, this was pretty darn TERRIBLE man. This is something I could imagine releasing around 2004 or 2005 and still being pretty bad but mildly acceptable. Not like I expected anything else after seeing the trailer but man.."
"This is a very bad film, there is no buildup in the relationships. The children are awful the whole time and he decides he wants to keep them. The woman he was awful too until the last day decides he is the guy for her, and cut to married. Very bad and I vomited."
"Not much more to say.
Everything about making bad movies is in here.
Not one giggle from the audience.
Awful, annoying kids and thick adults.
Bad acting...terrible direction.
This really is the bottom of the lowest barrel.
Total waste of money...glad I never paid.
This is one of the reasons why audiences are down.
Last week I watched Knives out and Maleficent...now that is how you make movies.
Then again this is not a movie..it's a film.
If you liked this you need a lobotomy and should be banned from ever going to the cinema again...for life.
worse then last years Holmes and Watson.
It is now time to give us a 0 score please .
I wanted to puke."
Everyone should go and see playing with ðŸ”¥ this weekend it is a ðŸ˜‚ movie to see with family and friends
"8/10 in my honest opinion.
Just got home from taking my son and his friend who are both 6 years old.
According to them... THEY LOVED IT! 10/10 for them!John Cena, Keegan-Michael Key, and John Leguizamo were great characters in this! Predictable characters, predictable story, & predictable outcome but that is the whole point of this movie.... it's a kids flick and you put ZERO thought into it and watch it play out!I actually belly laughed at several parts.
All the kids and tweens in the theatre laughed really really hard!Great Holiday Flick. The kids will love it!"
This is a family movie. No swearing. No nudity. No tawdry outfits. No murder. It was hilarious and fun and had a great story and a great cast and my family with a 12 year old daughter can't stop talking about it. We will buy as soon as it's available we lived it so much.
"This movie isn't meant to be taken seriously. It's not winning any Oscars, that's for sure. This movie is mostly meant for kids, but for me as an adult I loved it as well. I think it's nice to stop taking things seriously every once in a while and just watch a feel-good predictable movie. No need to overthink, reflect or try to figure out the ending before it happens. You just watch, smile and have fun."
"When I began to think that John Cena's ""serious"" delivery played out like the Ernest movies, I began to look at him like he was actually Ernest. Now I can't unsee it. If you told me he was Ernest on HGH, I would believe you.My kid liked it. It has likable moments, but it plays like a Disney stage show. Feels like they all said, ""One take is good enough for this scene boys. It ain't gonna get any better.""Suspension of disbelief is hard when a 22+ year old girl is playing a tween and an 8+ year old is playing someone in diapers. Some seriously forced plot moments here. The kids NEED to get into some unprovoked mischief because otherwise this movie would just be about guys sitting around in a firehouse with no pole. I would have loved to see more firefighting and less ""home alone knockoff."" Also, why are my favorite comedians and actors overacting so poorly?"
"In short, this film is loaded with poor acting, dreadful, unfunny writing, and absolutely horrific directorial styles. To be fair, there were a few mildly funny scenes; however, unfortunately the trailer spoiled them all."
"This movie was so bad I even watched people get up and walk out. A poor title,acting and plot. It just didn't get it. Funny? I don't think so.Bad humor.My wife and daughter also did not enjoy it.The consumerism is bad in this movie(there aught to a be a law against it).I think John Cena(the star of the movie)had better lay of the steroids and spend move time learning how to act. Please don't waste your money on this terrible terrible movie."
"Poor acting, not funny. One of the few movies I ever walked out on."
"I'm writing this with about 20 minutes left in the movie, if that tells you anything. Acting is cringe-worthy, minimal true laughs. Reminds me of any of the ""Earnest"" movies, and that's not a good thing. Take the kids though, theyll enjoy the poop and fart jokes that are throughout the movie"
I saw the cast and thought it might be fun - like Home Alone. Not at all! I like Keegan Key but this is not his best - maybe 'the man' writing his check altered his comedy and quickness he once gave us.I think Keegan needs to watch his old material and compare it this movie...
