"If you read the reviews, you could get the impression that the main flaw of the Playmobil movie is the fact that it's not the Lego movies. Yes, thank you, we know that.This movie does NOT try to be a clone of the Lego movies. Strangely, most reviews I have read seem to have a problem with that. The Playmobil movie is not full of meta jokes or references to other movies. The movie does not make fun of the quirks of old Playmobil sets. It's not self-aware. The characters don't know that they are toys. The fairy godmother behaves exactly like a fairy godmother; she's not behaving oddly or making sarcastic jokes. If you are expecting all those things, you are simply in the wrong movie.The Playmobil movie is exclusively targeting children, not adolescents or adults. From this point of view, it's a solid movie. The 3D animation looks a bit outdated but it brings very well the look and feel of the Playmobil toys to the big screen. The story is okay but I think it would have been better to spend more time on the characters instead of rushing through the different sceneries. There are locations that don't contribute anything to the story (e.g. the scene with the lava and the dinosaurs on the road), while potentially interesting characters like the fairy only have a short appearance. But again, that's me as an adult overanalyzing a children movie. Children will probably enjoy to see all their favourite Playmobil themes."
"Obviously you are going to compare this to the Lego movies and yes it very similar but it is still a fun film. It has a good story and the live action framing at the beginning and end of the film serves it well. in-fact the framing does point the way to a potential sequel that could flip the story round. I do have one negative thing to say, the songs do derail the film in places but fortunately the film quickly recovers so no harm done."
"Since this is a film about Playmobil, you can't expect anything else than a promotion of their toys. But still the story is reasonable, the action is good, the comedy is funny (for the target age group) and the visual effects are good.Go see it without unreasonable expectations and let yourself be entertained. If your kids like playing with Playmobil, then they'll like watching this film."
"My first review! But I couldn't not...I'm 42 male and actually make films myself and yes this is not written to take you on deep inner journeys or will it make you ponder life and will it win Oscar's no..but after seeing such bad reviews and from critics, is it not about time we let the kids review kids films. I asked my daughters 12, 9 and son 5 what they thought after the cinema and they really enjoyed it. So my 6/10 is from them!"
"Truly an underrated gem. The action is great, the racial slurs are a bit extreme at points, and the gore is too much. And it's perfect. Making this movie R rated was a great decision made by the director. Seeing Playmobil nudity was at first a bit off-putting, but it was what this movie needed. They gave Lino DiSalvo full control. Now, watch the box office explode."
"I really don't understand the bad ratings for the movie on this site. I went to see the movie with my son and was delighted. Sure, the songs don't hold up with Disney songs, but overall the movie was fun, entertaining and very well made. Recommended family movie!"
This film was good! My 4 year old loved it all the way through
"I was able to see this at the Annecy Festival in France. I went in expecting that it would try to be the Lego Movie with it's meta-humor and rapid fire pop culture references, but it wasn't. This movie was completely different than Lego. The only thing they share in common is that they're both based on toys.""Playmobil"" is a story about a brother and sister who get sent into another dimension, one that looks just like the Playmobil toys the little brother plays with.The movie is funny, it's cute, it's got tons of great songs. Definitely a movie for the family to enjoy!"
"My expectations for Playmobil: The Movie were very low, and I still thought this was a very weak movie. The best thing going for this movie is the Animation style. There is at least a good amount of effort put into it and it's not an ugly movie from that point of view. I thought the scenes outside the Playmobil universe were really awful like that kid who was bad at acting. The Playmobil universe stuff fairs a tiny bit better, but it was still very predictable and basically felt like a very watered down Lego Movie, with almost all of the jokes falling flat. The movie being a Musical did catch me off guard and I respect them trying, but honestly all the songs are forgettable. There's not really any memorable characters or locations either, which doesn't help alleviate the blandness at all.Is Playmobil: The Movie the worst thing you could watch? Certainly not. However, the kids in my cinema were not laughing all that much in this movie, and the adults just didn't seem to be all that engaged watching this movie at all. This is a very straightforward story and at least the plot doesn't have too much pointless filler like some other Animated movies I've seen this year like The Queen's Corgi and The Secret Life of Pets 2. However, with The Angry Birds Movie 2 out at the same time, I'd feel that one is the better watch out of the two as the kids were having a great time watching that movie compared to Playmobil. In all honestly, I was kind of hoping Playmobil: The Movie might have been a decent Animated movie to watch, but sadly it's just a bit of a bore.3/10"
"I wasn't holding high hopes for this film but I was pleasantly surprised. The film is completely different to the Lego movie, it's just a kids adventure film with a very light hearted vibe but rattles along at a really good speed.There are plenty of laughs for adults as well which is always great in a kids film, as is no lulls for kids to get bored. The premise of the story is light but the characters are good and amusing.It seems to have fallen between stools as to whether it's a musical, it has a few songs but not that many to make it a fully fledged musical.I was really surprised to see the bad reviews, this is the best kids film I have seen for a while."
Really enjoyed a family screening of Playmobil the Movie over the weekend. Full of fun characters from the world of Playmobil working together to save the day. Fantasy and magic had the little ones around us enraptured and engaged.
"I caught a screening of this movie at the Annecy Film Festival. I was expecting something like the Lego movie with rapid fire pop culture references and a throw anything at the wall attitude.But this movie was way different than those Lego movies. It's a cute story about a brother and sister that are sent to a Playmobil world. The sister is a regular person, but the little brother gets to be a big, tough guy viking.This movie was really cute. And all the songs were great. Don't go in thinking it's going to be like Lego. It's definitely got a different feeling throughout. Kids will love it and parents won't be bored when watching it with them."
"Mixed thoughts, I found a few scenes funny, and it's got well done animation and live action but it's just a dull rip off of the Lego Movie so nothing original"
"Annoying,pandering and generic blur of motion that has no reason to exist"
"Children's animated adventure, introduced with a short live action backstory where Marla (a teenage girl) gets her own passport and wants to travel. Late one evening Marla is babysitting Charlie (her brother), there's a knock at the door, and the police are there. We realise their parents have been in a tragic road accident.The plot jumps forward 4 years and Marla is responsible for Charlie, her traveling ambition has been shelved. Charlie has a squabble with Marla and runs off, Marla is able to track his whereabouts via a phone app. Marla finds Charlie at a games convention and they are both sucked into a colourful, animated Playmobil adventure.They get separated, the plot switches to a rescue mission involving several characters in different action and chase scenes with some musical numbers.This is aimed at very young audience, the movie won't appeal much to parents, especially as there are much better Lego movies to compare with.I laughed twice. Mya (our granddaughter) liked it, she's 9 years old.
Stay in your seats for a short post credit scene, taster to a potential for a sequel."
"Wow wow wow .. one of the best animation movie that I have ever watched , Anya Taylor was great & The songs were really cute and nice 9.5/10"
"Marla and Charlie travel from the real world on an adventure to the Playmobil universe where they re-enact their favourite toys.Very children-focussed with only a few laughs for grown-ups and those gags that do work tend to get over-played. The story is OK but Charlie and Marla both spend too long being lost and needy. The voicing and animation is good. The design of the Playmobil realm was nicely done but the portal into it was unimaginative.I liked, ""Rex Dasher!"""
The reviews for this really are not fair my 6 & 8 year old loved it and I personally thought was as good as Lego movies.
"It's a really good movie and as usual many educate matters you can find at Playmobil, Good animation, happy entertaining, and fun story."
The film is very formulaic and essentially one big advert for playmobil. Despite that I did just about enjoy it given it had just about enough laughs and a crazy enough storyline to keep me involved as an adult. I imagine young kids would enjoy it even more also. Not the worst kids film you'll see although certainly not the best your kids will enjoy it and you won't completely want to tear your hair out so worth a family trip out on a rainy day.
"I think the poor reviews this movie received are a reflection of a jaded, entirely-adult community of reviewers. It wasn't perfect - it was somewhat light on jokes that my 5-year-old understood and the live action sequences were a little tense and ill-fitting, but made for acceptable bookend sequences. The screenplay was quite good, and the voice acting was superb. The songs weren't the focal point of the movie & kind of began and ended without much adieu, which I actually preferred over the jarring music video feel of the songs in Frozen/2. Gaffigan's character felt like he wrote his dialogue himself and thus it was a particular highpoint. The joke at the end about the other dinosaurs recognizing the main one was an excellent end to the movie. The entire sequence with Radcliffe was very good viewing material, though maybe not as much for young kids."
Just an hourt long commercial for Playmobil. They ought to pay people to see it
"The Lego Movie shattered the expectations of toy-based movies with a dynamic story, great comedy, decent sequences of actions, and a balance of kids to adult audiences. While the sequels that followed took stride in their own remark, the first one really opened our eyes to quality kids animation. Enter tonight's movie, in the form of Playmobile, a similar design to the classic pegs, but with a little more movement and cost-effective price to appease the younger crowd. Tonight's movie offers the same sort of approach, hoping to get the animated holiday feature in before Oscar season swoops in. What is the verdict?

Not As Well BalancedSUMMARY:Like many animated movies, Playmobil is very nicely designed to bring the family fun atmosphere to the forefront of the show. Smooth movement, cute design, and nod back to the days of creating worlds with the simple figure, this movie manages to bring imagination back on the big screen. Like many of my fellow reviewers have stated, this film is certainly cute, with the short run time of about 80 minutes (not counting credits) being focused on heartwarming, moral filled lessons in a nice dynamic package. It's a great lesson for the ideal audience of kids, which should bring smiles to the young faces and the parents that accompany them. Finally, like most kids films, Playmobil is ready to pump the speakers up with original music, that is toe tapping selection of catchy tunes about the morals we need in our lives.Yet the other side of the coins have valid points for me in regards to this film, especially when one sees what was accomplished in other animation films. For one thing the voice acting is okay, which can either be due to performance or direction of the character. Anya Taylor-Joy does a decent job, and young actor Gabriel Bateman accomplishes the vulnerable child in over his head role well as he starts discovering himself. My champions are Gaffigan and Daniel Radcliffe whose characters are probably the most engaging of the supporting characters and bringing the dynamic cast to a rather one-note movie. Unlike other films, the movie falls short of the dynamic storytelling that other company productions have excelled in. It's plot is thin and very predictable, a linear tale with few bumps or surprises to amazing and wow as the writing continues to favor the younger generations filled with jokes and preachy speeches crammed on in. Sure the humor is cute, but the movie needed better balance for this reviewer and working on making a more exciting tale that utilized the humor and lessons as a supporting role instead of the central pillar. The action scenes are rather limited, mostly due to the G rating, but also because the villain is another example of a grandiose, pompous, speech expert who does little else. Because of these two factors, alongside the linear telling, just results in a bland adventure that might not be as entertaining to the older crowd, which is a shame given what they can do in these movies.
The VERDICT:Playmobil is not an awful movies, it just doesn't have the same balance or execution that the Lego movie, or other films for kids have been able to pull off. Certainly, the animation, story, and cute atmosphere will certainly impress the target audience of youngsters. Sadly, the fact that the film struggles to find balance in the presentation to the audience with its predictable, G rate film is going to be the biggest obstacle to see this movie. With a feel much more fitting of a Nick Jr. or Playhouse Disney feel, Playmobil is much better suited to a home viewing where the little ones can corral into the living room and watch it for the short run time. Overall, the movie will deliver to the young generation, but given Frozen is out, Spy in Disguise is on its way, and Star Wars, this film is going to be out of the theater quickly unfortunately. Therefore, my scores are:Animation/Adventure/Comedy: 6.5
Movie Overall: 5.0"
"I actually found it entertaining. It's a blatant rip off of several other movies (Lego, Star Wars, The Terminator, Bond, Thor Ragnarok) but overall I liked it and your kids probably will like it too."
