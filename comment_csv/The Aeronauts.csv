"This historical plot happened in 1862, it was a flight of British aircraft James Glaisher and Henry Coxwell, whose hot air balloon broke the world record for flight altitude, reaching approximately 11,887 m (38,999 ft). However, while Glaisher appears in the film, Coxwell has been replaced by Amelia Rennes, a fictional character, it is a real shame that those who are so worried about the truth continue to lie, believes that the film is well made, but the lie... to put the woman is ridiculous and in bad taste about such a remarkable historical fact.....
Certainly a total foolishness of director Tom Harper, apparently they want to change history at all costs....."
"Film well made, but they repeated twice its supposedly based on true events and its not because this strong woman Amelia is pure fantasy, and its a fantasy in very offensive way because she is replacement for real historical figure... yes its happens to be a man (poor person! what a shame! born with wrong sex). I actually quite can't understand why this film more appropriate than films with white blackface actors. Its very sad and ridicules. Like we don't have already many woman in history and need this shameful replacement at all. If there was a woman balloonist who died about 40 years before the film took place - why harper don't shoot film about her? Or why he even bother mentioned about ""based on true events""? This is so stupid situation."
"This film is very loosely based on the 1862 flight of British aeronauts James Glaisher and Henry Coxwell. But director Tom Harper decided to pink-wash history - deliberately re-writing a male
character as female - solely because of his own ideological biases:
Last year, Keith Moore, Head of Library at the Royal Society - the independent scientific academy of the UK - criticised Harper's film for 'airbrushing' Glaisher's male companion,
balloonist Henry Coxwell, out of the story. 'I wanted it not to be two middle-aged men in a basket,' shrugs Harper..
Let's follow this reasoning to its own insane conclusion. Imagine if the same director decided that other historical stories weren't ""diverse"" enough for his tastes. Maybe he decides to rewrite
history by casting a white woman as MLK or Shaka Zulu. Or an Asian woman to play Obama.
If Harper wanted to devise his own story, so be it. But right now he's appropriating the true story of two men in order to shoehorn a woman in. That's pink-washing at its absolute worst."
"A scientist, James Glaisher (Eddie Redmayne), and a balloonist, Amelia Wren (Felicity Jones), take to the skies to break the altitude record whilst also recording data that will help to predict the weather. Along the way they must face a raging storm, extreme cold, and the danger of plummeting to their deaths.The Aeronauts is obviously intended to make the spirit soar, but rather than providing me with an uplifting experience, I was bored by the film. Once our plucky adventurers have risen above the clouds, there is nowhere interesting for the story to go. It would seem that the sky really is the limit.The supposedly tense scenes designed to tap into one's fear of extreme heights did little to make me squirm on the edge of my seat: I couldn't help but picture Redmayne and Jones acting against a green screen for the majority of the 100 minute runtime (although it felt much longer). Numerous earth-bound flashbacks add very little to the story, but do serve to make the film even more soporific.It's also irritating to discover that, although based on actual events, The Aeronauts seeks to rewrite history: in reality, Glaisher's pilot was one Henry Coxwell, not a pretty widow. Of course, two men in a basket wouldn't have had such cross-gender appeal."
"OK, here we go again, and again, and again...The film is a major disservice to history of science and to the real people involved in this fascinating episode in the development of balloning.
The fact is that the omission of Henry Tracey Coxwell the lad who was Glaisher's copilot is another shameful act by Hollywood.
A film that claims to be based on ""true events"" should at least give credit where is credit is due.
If writers and directors continue this trend, I will not be surprised if, for instance in a film depicting the D-Day invasion of Normandy we see the American army composed entirely of women."
"I saw this movie in Toronto for the film festival. I wasn't really expecting much but wow was I impressed! This was the first time in a long time I felt like I was seeing something I'd never seen before.The special effects were top-notch... they didn't look like CGI and so I was never taken out of the movie. As good as the effects are, they are only PART of what makes this movie great. The characters (played by Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones) are amazing and both actors portray them with strength and vulnerability. Felicity is especially stunning, and she gives an amazing performance that's not to be missed. It takes a while to learn their backstories, but it's worth the investment. They really come to rely on each other in unexpected ways, and by the end you have a real sense of what the balloon ride means to each of them personally. The climax is so filled with suspense and emotion I was gasping in my seat.REALLY glad I got to see it on the big screen. Would recommend doing the same if you can -- trust me it's worth the effort. You'll get lost in this movie and feel like you've traveled back in time to the Golden Age of Hollywood. I hope it releases near me so I can take my kids to see it."
This is a must see in the theater. It's stunning. Both visually and from a performance perspective. Everything is A+ and the bonus is that it's good for the whole family. Felicity is doing things you've never seen her do before and Eddie is fantastic. Wonderful supporting cast but the achievement is how tense and giant in scope the movie is while seemingly confined in a small space.
"Came to see this without too many expectations and was pleasantly surprised. The backstory wasn't very interesting and a bit slow to develop but the balloon scenes were beautifully rendered, thrilling and engaging. I literally clung to my seat during some of them. I liked how the film respected the scientific endeavor and the viewers by avoiding cliche romantic developments between its characters. Overall, an entertaining night, even if I won't remember it by tomorrow."
"""The Aeronauts"" is an amazing film. After all, it's released by Amazon Pictures....yet has a huge budget. It's also one of the most visually arresting films I've ever seen and MUST be seen on the big screen, not your home television. This is because it's all about a famous balloon flight well over a hundred years ago...one that set a record but nearly killed the folks in the process.Felicity Jones and Eddie Redmayne must have been cost Amazon a fortune...as well as the amazing aerial scenes (some done with balloons and some CGI...though it all looks amazingly real). It's the story about a world record-setting balloon flight in 1862 that it turns out ISN'T 100% true. Felicity's character actually was a woman balloonist who had died about 40 years BEFORE the film took place! The person who actually did the amazing things she did in the movie was a guy...a guy who received no credit in the film for his actions. This is why although I thoroughly loved the film when I was watching it (preparing to give it a 10), I was very disappointed when I learned the truth about the famous Glaisher flight."
"Wow what a boring if not visually stunning film, no character building no historical accuracy just put a woman in there to fit in with the times. There is just no meat there to keep you watching"
"I did not have high expectations about the film. I definitely was not a fan of Jones before this, therefore I was not too happy to find out she was going to be a main character. Also, a film about two people on a hot air balloon? As much of a balloon lover, I definitely was not expecting such a gripping film.
Despite most of it being set on the balloon itself, and in spite of the plot not being particularly intricate, the Aeronauts will definitely keep your attention for the entire duration of the film, with unexpected turns and some truly captivating scenes.
Jones's acting is superb and she is the true star of the film. Redmayne does not disappoint, as usual, although I would have expected more from his character.
Special credits also to the make-up artists.Although undoubtedly improbable for the time, to have a woman on a challenge to reach the highest point ever reached by humans, it is really a good film.
A good sound system will make it justice, but please try watching it at the cinema if you can, for a more memorable experience!"
"As long you nothing about the real story you'll enjoy this and see it for what it is - a visual masterpiece which would be amazing in IMAX .History was made by Glaisher and his male co pilot reaching roughly the height of Everest - the achievements of Victorians in their primitive pioneering equipment has to be admiredFor drama and film fans the fictional female co pilot works really well and adds to the story who cares if it's not accurate - is Shakespeare historical ? Not it's drama based on history .Felicity Jones is the star of the show both in her acting and the character she plays .Greenwich looks great as the obvious location to base most of the film in and the drama in the basket could easily transfer to stage .The film deserves credit for costume , setting and make up .It's a film like a piece of classical music it takes a while to get into but builds up to a great crescendo always backed up by a great scriptPad.A 7/10"
"""The Aeronauts"" is very loosely based on the career of the scientist James Glaisher who in 1862 was one of two men who set a new world record of 39,000 feet for the greatest height ever achieved in a balloon. Glaisher's aim in ascending to that height, however, was not simply to set a record for its own sake. He believed that by studying conditions in the upper atmosphere he could make an important contribution to scientific knowledge, particularly to the then young science of meteorology.The film departs from historical fact in a number of ways, some of them minor, others more substantial. It has the balloon taking off in London, whereas in fact the ascent took place from Wolverhampton. Glaisher's father was also named James, but in the film he is referred to as Arthur. More seriously, when Glaisher refers to his belief that one day it will be possible to predict the weather, his fellow-scientists, almost to a man, ridicule him. In fact, the idea that the weather can be predicted was starting to gain scientific credibility in the 1860s; the forerunner of today's Met Office had been founded (by Darwin's friend Captain Robert Fitzroy of ""Beagle"" fame) in 1854.The most significant change from the historical record concerns Glaisher's pilot. In real life this was Henry Tracey Coxwell who, despite that feminine-looking middle name, was definitely male. Coxwell, however, is written out of this story and is replaced by Amelia Rennes, a fictitious character based upon real-life female balloonists such as Sophie Blanchard and Margaret Graham. For some reason her surname is spelt in the cast-list as ""Wren"", but this must be an error as Amelia is the English-born widow of a French balloonist named Pierre Rennes, who met his death in a ballooning accident.So what is the point of turning Coxwell into an attractive young woman? I initially assumed that the intention was to turn the story into a Victorian rom-com, especially as Glaisher here becomes a young bachelor played by the handsome Eddie Redmayne. (In real life, in 1862 he was a married man of 53). I was, however, to be proved wrong; no romance develops and the relationship between Glaisher and Amelia remains platonic.Part of the answer, I think, is to make a feminist statement by providing us with a strong, capable and courageous female character, something of a rarity in period dramas. The heritage cinema genre has its merits, but it has never quite been able to shake off the accusation that it has perpetuated the stereotype of 18th and 19th century ladies as passive figures who spent most of their time sitting around in drawing rooms while the men did all the work. This sort of figure is caricatured here by Amelia's more conservative sister Antonia, who cannot understand why her sibling insists on messing about in balloons instead of settling down to domestic bliss with some nice young man. That is not, however, the whole answer; there are other reasons, connected with the circumstances of Pierre's death, why this particular story would not have worked with two male protagonists.The film is more of an adventure-thriller than a rom-com. The central question is not ""Will they fall in love?"" but ""Will they survive when things go wrong?"" And, of course, things do go wrong; nobody is going to make a film about a balloon which takes off safely and then lands safely about an hour-and-a-half later after an uneventful flight. (The main action, the balloon flight itself, is shown in real time, with occasional flashbacks detailing the earlier lives of the protagonists).If I had one criticism it would be that Amelia's feats of derring-do as she climbs out of the basket and clambers all over the balloon, several miles above the ground, to save the flight from disaster seem a bit exaggerated, even though the special effects involved are impressive. Could anyone really have done that without plunging to her death? I know that James Bond performs several similarly improbable feats in every episode of his adventures, but then the Bond movies are supposed to be tongue-in-cheek, whereas ""The Aeronauts"" wants us to take it seriously in every other respect.There are, however, good performances from Felicity Jones as the gutsy Amelia and from Redmayne as Glaisher. He rather reminded me of Newt Scamander, his character from the ""Fantastic Beasts"" movies, another young, earnest and slightly bumbling scientist. (I have never seen his portrayal of another real-life scientist, Stephen Hawking in ""The Theory of Everything""). Overall, ""The Aeronauts"" is not just an enjoyable period adventure; it also asks some serious questions about whether it is worth risking one's life in pursuit of fame, glory or scientific knowledge. Just don't go to see it if you are afraid of heights.A goof. Glaisher's mother is here given the name Ethel. This is an unlikely name for an elderly lady who was probably born around 1790, as the name did not come into general use until the mid-19th century. Anyone called Ethel in 1862 would have been either a child or a much younger woman than old Mrs Glaisher."
"The Aeronauts is an exquisite film that is sure to become a classic for the family. This deeply emotional story is elevated by the stunning performances of Felicity Jones and Eddie Redmayne, who take us with them on an exhilarating ride. It's a fantastic film that I cannot wait to see in the theatre again."
"A stunning story that tugs at the heartstrings. Felicity Jones and Eddie Redmayne bring their characters to life with a lively chemistry that elevates the film to new heights. The cinematography transports you into the world of the film, making you feel like you're joining Amelia and James on their historic flight. I'm definitely going to see it again when it hits theaters in December!"
"AeronautsWe have had a recent spate of these strange biopics, but it is indeed rare to find someone that has had sufficiently interesting enough life to make the project worthwhile and indeed sufficient to sustain a movie.The two leads flung their all to bring to life the dead horse of a script. It was tedious from start to finish, who cares or has even heard of these people.My advice, unless you are Alan Turing or Freddie Mercury or Winston Churchill don't bother creating a script."
"I just got out of AeronautsI was having some lunch with my son, when we decided to go see a movie, I'd not even heard of this movie, let alone seen a trailer (I seemed to miss this thread) or read any reviews, so I went in 100% cold, except knowing it starred Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones.I'll just say this, if I had watched the trailer, I would have not have gone. As I spent the majority of my time, gripping the arm of my chair, or shaking with vertigo!! Ever since I suffered a brain injury a few years ago, I'm awful with heights.I was surprised to see it was made by Amazon Studios. I have to say this is the kind of adventure tale that isn't made well that often anymore. When it focuses on its main plot, it's an effective movie of two people who did the impossible, when it shows flashbacks, it gets a little flat.I have a bit of a soft spot for Redmayne, I find him really likeable and I enjoyed Jones in Rogue One and The Theory Of Everything, they do have good chemistry, even though there is no romantic relationship, here. Himish Patel (Yesterday) was solid supporting too.With great cinematography and a truly engaging performance from its female lead, this one surprised me, and if you have a chance to see it in theaters before its eventual Amazon release, you should take it."
"I watched this via preview and I have to say this was an amazing film. both the lead characters acting was spell binding, for 141 minutes i could not look away. from the first scenes to the credits it was a pleasure to watch. looking forward to seeing this in he cinema"
"Watched this via Amazon Preview and one of the best films they have released recently. The story revolves around a meteorologist and a balloonist who come together due to circumstances forced apon them.The film flows nicely, never boring and with the amazing views and drama will keep you on the edge of your seat.There are other characters but Felicity Jones stands out as the class act and she should be rewarded with some award nominations."
"Enjoy the altitude, my palms haven't been this sweaty since 'Free Solo'."
A very gripping film which I felt involved with. A worthwhile watch at the cinema.
I couldn't help thinking about all the stuff they throw over the side and how it could kill some poor person on the ground walking to the shops or tending to the garden. Very irresponsible.
"For me, I watch the movie first from a bus, while I was on travel then I tried two times to go to the DVD shop to purchase the disc. I love this movie, specially the wonderful scenes. It's incredible for me."
"Tom Harper directs Felicity Jones as a daredevil balloonist in The Aeronauts, but now left a grieving widow after a balloon flight disaster with her French husband, Felicity based her character Amelia Rennes on Sophie Blanchard, also an aeronautical widow. And now Amelia has lost her confidence. Just at the time that Eddie Redmayne's meteorologist James Glaisher needs a balloon. And a pilot.A born entertainer Amelia is part of London Society, if only her worried sister, played by Phoebe Fox, could get her dressed. And James Gleisher is earthbound but striving to predict the weather, if he could only get high enough. Up to the thermals even, that his colleague John Trew, played by Himesh Patel, believes are up there. Eddie Redmayne always seems to portray the same slightly humble and bumbling guy. And after years of ridicule James is ready to bon voyage his naysaying colleagues to prove his point. If only Amelia would agree to the flight. But she may change her mind when John tells her James thinks it will snow tonight. A beautiful moment as the flakes fall.I had no idea watching the balloon being made just how big it was, and then how majestic it looks in the sky. And how dangerous was the plan to fly higher than anyone before. And it's tempting to say the action takes place in a limited set, about as big as a balloon basket, but the sky really is the limit in the reach of the film. Filming took place in the flying balloon with a helicopter. And quiet, like space, you just hear every breath of James and Amelia. And the views are amazing, not great for vertigo sufferers I hasten to add. The big screen is where to see The Aeronauts though. And so high up you need your waterproofs at the very least, those storm clouds are heavy! And with the butterflies that proved John Trew's thermal theory just so beautiful.And as the air thins, we see how far down below James and Amelia found their way to be up so high. James has a loving relationship with his mother and father played by Tom Courtenay and Anne Reid. Such a cracking cast from Tom Harper with Felicity and Eddie reprising their Theory Of Everything on screen chemistry. But it seems that meteorology is not considered an actual science among his science fraternity. Only John Trew believes, but neither has the money to pursue it themselves. Historically John may also have been the one in the balloon with James. But the fictional Amelia is nursing a broken heart and a guilt she dare not admit to herself.And Amelia has been here before, so high in the sky, she knows the dangers, and yet James is reckless in the name of science. Each new height is a record that makes him want to push on up, and break for the scientific hell of it. And he's unprepared, science is more important than suitable clothing! As Amelia's hair twinkles with a coating of fetching snow flakes.And as the ascent was beautiful and thrilling, then the descent is necessary, as oxygen runs out in the atmosphere, and absolutely terrifying. Amelia taking on something that surely should be impossible even now. And to answer myself a stunt person surely did it. Otherwise it was very good CGI. I had no idea whether what she was doing would succeed, I know nothing about hot air-ballooning, and the thought of the cold making the frozen balloon shatter, had my heart in my mouth at every creak. And up there, there is only you in a balloon, and ropes to hold you on.And as the heaviest part of the balloon was the basket, then to get them down, it had to go. As James and Amelia hang on by a thread. Earth is at least 37,000 feet below, and it's going to be a bumpy ride. But what a thriller, as the flight takes place in real time you can literally feel you are flying with them. And be relieved you aren't!"
"Really enjoyed this film but bought back to me my fear of air balloons which I thought I'd overcome.We are on the path of an air balloon Company and three years ago I was in my garden in July on all fours just tending to my Diospyros Crassenevis flowerbed and felt the hardest hit on the back of my head, my wife said she heard it in the conversatory, I lost consciousness momentarily and ended up in A and E. Thankfully no long term physical damage.The things we found in our garden that people think it's funny to throw out, well it ain't if it lands on your head.The culprit was a half full plastic Thermos flask someone had kindly tossed out of one of the balloons. So, when I saw all the stuff they were throwing out of that balloon I started to hyperventilate in the cinema and had to get my paper bag out to regulate my breathing, much to the disgust of those around me with the rustling.The film is a bit slow at times but good storytelling and direction.Good acting, particularly from the two leads.He's a good chap Eddie, I've seen him twice in Stafford, once in the Co-op and then Sainsbury's café! Very pleasant, I think he's stalking me!
Felicity I saw in the Birmingham Bullring. I live in a world of celebrity haha. Both nice people and gifted actors.The CGI is good and appears perfectly natural, not over done as I anticipated.We saw this in our brand new Odeon Luxe in Stafford in the isense. Amazing theatre and SO glad Odeon Luxe came to our area.Don't wait until this is out on streaming as you need a big screen to realise its full potential.Not an Oscar winner but very well done film."
"One of the best acted, thrilling and engaging movies I have ever seen. The whiners who want credit to go to the MAN who apparently performed this super human feat need to remember this is a MOVIE based on some true events-not a factual documentary film. Take the whole family and enjoy, it will leave you breathless! Oscar material for certain."
I know historically it's not correct but I go to watch films for entertainment not a history lesson so disregarding that side of things. Jones and Redmayne had great chemistry the whole film was utterly charming if lacking depth at times but enjoyable none the less. Seeing it in IMAX is definitely worthwhile as it's simply breathtaking at times visually.
"Despite the familiar narrative, The Aeronauts is a great drama/adventure with genuinely thrilling moments throughout. Felicity Jones and Eddie Redmayne both give great performances and have really good chemistry. The CG is impressive. It's extremely well filmed with fantastic direction from Tom Harper. The music by Steven Price is excellent."

"The Aeronauts: The story of a famous balloon flight in 1862 which broke flight altitude records and enabled important discoveries about the layers of the atmosphere. i'm afraid the story here is romanticised as two male scientists carried out the ascent but film is the better for thus subterfuge. Amelia Rennes (Felicity Jones) is a balloon pilot who has given up the trade after losing her husband in a tragedy bound flight. James Glaisger (Eddie Remayne) is an astronomer and meteorologist who persuades Amelia to fly once again so that he may prove his theories and break the altitude record. The flight sets off from a fairground, made into a spectacle to raise necessary finance. Amelia is the artiste turning cartwheels to delight the crowd tossing a dog on a parachute out of the balloon basket. Glaisher is very much the staid scientist.Flashbacks show how Amelia lost her husband and the lead up to the flight. Glaisher's theories are mocked at the Royal Society (stock scene of whiskered elderlry men laughing at young scientist) andhe is refused funding for experiments. Some great aerial scenes tension is maintained throughout, with some shots literally heart-stopping. Also a little dark humour, Glaisher sends off homing pigeons at various stages of the ascent, eventually at too high an altitude a pigeon plummets when he tosses it in the air. A great adventure story directed and co-written by Tom Harper (Wild Rose) who acknowledges the book Falling Upwards by Richard Holmes as an inspiration for the film. 8/10,"
"I really enjoyed this movie on a subject i had never ever thought about, that being the earliest exploration of the air. Again we have a modern movie as a roller coaster ride where the bigger the screen the bigger the impact. Off coarse everything is computer generated special effects that give impossible birds i views. The result for me was a royal vertigo attack which since i have no head for heights was pretty severe but in the end i though that was a surprising enjoyable flight to the clouds with two very pleasing leads."
"I surprised my self by really enjoying this film. It is well made and exciting and a great spectacle on the big screen. Both Felicity jones and Eddie Redmain are good but basically play the parts the same as they always do (if you get my drift). It's a great story, I'm not too bothered about the change of pilot. My only gripe is that the Flight should have started in Wolverhampton and ended in Ludlow Shropshire, I m sure international audience realise there are more places in the uk than just London."
"The movie made my cry, smile and be so proud. The acting was great in all of the moment, every little detail was perfected. Many wisdom paragraphs, I really enjoyed all of the minutes from this movie, wasn't bored for ever a second."
Really enjoyed the movie and it definitely made me anxious in places! Solid performance by the cast
"James Glaisher; wan'abe Victorian weatherman, arranges a balloon trip to study the atmosphere with pilot Amelia Rennes.The film played out more-or-less as I expected with a few scrapes and heroics. I'd been told that the cinematography was really good and that description does not do it justice; it far exceeded my expectations.I did not like the constant flashbacks that become more meaningless as the movie progresses. Why not start at the launch, rewind then let it play out chronologically?I liked it when they dropped Posey."
"The sky is our limit. Our ambitious endeavours, boundless by the mysterious stars that plague the night. Eloquent diamonds dancing on a twinkled canvas. The infallible lust for discovery, eternally motivated to make the world and ourselves more habitable. Safer. Predictable.Harper's loose adaptation of Holmes' novel, for better or worse, takes the capabilities of artistic licence and alters history for the sake of entertainment. Whilst unnecessary in depicting the scientific discoveries and world-shattering record at the time, Harper's daring adventurous thrill-ride passes through the stratosphere with vivid colours. Meteorologist Glaisher and balloon pilot Rennes attempt to break the world-record height of 23,000ft, but soon encounter a battle for survival when their minds become deluded from the insufficient oxygen.As I was saying, artistic licence is a powerful element to filmmaking. In the wrong hands, an irresponsible change in history could be produced, tarnishing the events that actually occurred. Conversely, it could be used to elevate a vital moral that, whilst enhances entertainment, retains the delicacy of history without diminishing its achievements. Harper and Thorne teeter on the two halves, precariously floating through thunderous clouds of inaccuracy. The removal of Glaisher's scientific partner Coxwell, replaced by the fictional Rennes, was haphazard. With no acknowledgement of his existence, The Aeronauts clearly rains down upon the realms of light entertainment, and that's absolutely fine. But to utilise Glaisher's real persona instead of fictionalising his character whilst retaining his discoveries, felt deflating for Coxwell.Having said that, the addition of Rennes and surprisingly making her story at the forefront of the narrative, inspired a bountiful amount of female empowerment during the repressed Victorian era. Her lack of knowledge in Glaisher's area of expertise resulted in an accessible screenplay that allowed audiences to instantly connect with her. As the human component to the aeronautical adventure, Rennes seamlessly moves forward in being the main protagonist. A refreshing change that juxtaposes Redmayne and Jones' previous partnership in 'The Theory of Everything'. It allowed Jones, who absolutely captivated with her buoyant performance, to showcase a physically demanding and emotionally vulnerable journey.The tragic personal loss that plagues Rennes' stability, testing her ornate instinct in survivability. Riding in thunderous clouds, battling oxygen deficiency and climbing a freezing balloon whilst combating frostbite at 36,000ft. Just a shame that Redmayne rarely changes up his usual bumbling performance that we've seen time and time again. Harper's intent focus on teamwork and partnership, allows the film's moral to come shining through. Some reach for the stars, others push others towards them.The flashback structure prevents a completely linear experience for occurring, and adds appropriate drips of backstory without diminishing the excitement of their gradual ascent. The abrupt cuts do produce an irregular pace, especially when the two barely survive a raincloud only for the editing to splice a societal debate back in London, but the outstanding visuals and Price's intense score (as to be expected...) instantly regulate the taste for adventure again. Simply the best panoramic visuals of the year. The endless blanket of cumulus clouds envelope you in an overwhelming horizon, conveying the solidarity of these two daredevils. Then, when they reach the summit of their ascent, well, I was on the edge of my seat. Superbly thrilling!The Aeronauts, despite the historical inaccuracy and fictionalised strands for the sake of entertainment, floats through the atmosphere in a gloriously thrilling adventure that remains both grounded in narration and afloat in excitement. No hot air balloon rides for me..."
"I rather enjoyed this. OK, you do have to suspend reality a little; there are quite a few plausibilty gaps that could get under your skin if you allowed them to, but both Jones and Redmayne turn in good performances in what is essentially a two-hander. Obviously, loads of CGI but the super imagery and the pace of the direction keeps it going along well - and at times it is a damn sight more scary than most recent proper horror movies. Sadly, I saw this in a cinema of 500-odd seats by myself - that was a real shame - it really deserves better. Go see it!"
"Period costume drama, based on actual events in London 1862.High tension with a scientist and balloonist who take a flight to a record breaking altitude. The objective is to take recordings from a multitude of scientific equipment as they pass through the different layers of atmosphere in order to advance the knowledge of meteorology and enable the prediction of the weather.The chemistry between the co-stars is believable, they've working on similar projects before. The special effects, and particularly high altitude views are breath-taking. The altitude brings them very close to a frozen death, but do they make it back?"
"There is, like the man said, nothing new under the sun, and the irony of using the medium of film where all of space is available to explore characters confined to a single small area has been employed by Hitchcock (Lifeboat) and Billy Wilder (The Spirit of St Louis). The first fictional, the second factual Lifeboat depicted a typical Hollywood bomber-crew adrift on the ocean in a small boat whilst The Spirit of St Louis chronicled the real flight by Charles Lindbergh in 1927 between North America and Europe. Wilder being Wilder 'invented' a fly that became trapped in the cockpit thus providing the Lone Eagle with something to talk to. The Aeronauts is a combination of both, half fact, half fiction, fact inasmuch as the meteorologist Glaisher DID actually make the balloon ascent in 1862 but he was accompanied by another MAN rather than the fictional character played by Felicity Jones. In 2019 cgi is light years ahead of the 'special effects' of previous decades and much of the attraction of The Aeronauts will be visual but the thespic contributions by Felicity Jones and Eddie Redmayne should not be overlooked."
"I have to say I saw this film on IMAX which did make a difference as some of the scenes are amazing during the film. It has to be said, although some of the obvious green screen parts are not convincing, the panoramic scenes of old London really make the film watching alone.Eddie Redmayne plays The character he seems to play in all films but he does it well and the acting is good overall. To be fair the weather is not the most gripping subject but the film makes the most of it.The plot is a little shallow and predictable and some of the scenes a bit over dramatic but this is still a good British movie ."
"Really enjoyed the movie, but seriously disappointed to discover afterwards that history had been rewritten to serve present day wokeness. Those involved should seriously look in the mirror. Anyway, they forgot the health warning: anyone suffering from chronic vertigo should be warned off. I felt quite queasy at times."
"Greetings again from the darkness. 'Up, up, and away, in my beautiful balloon.' That song says nothing about a lack of oxygen (hypoxemia), a malfunctioning valve, or frost bite ... all of which come into play in this story inspired by real life events of 1862 in London. Tom Harper directed the excellent WILD ROSE earlier this year, and for this one, he and his co-writer Jack Thorne (WONDER, 2017) base the story on both the real life record-breaking flight of scientist James Glaisher and balloon pilot Henry Coxwell, and Richard Holmes' book ""Falling Upwards: How We Took to the Air.'Reuniting from THE THEORY OF EVERYTHING (2014) where they played Stephen Hawking and wife Jane, are Eddie Redmayne (as scientist-with-a-chip James Glaisher) and Felicity Jones (as fictional balloon pilot Amelia Wren/Rennes ... yes, naming your female pilot Amelia is so very creative). Courageous real life balloon pilot Henry Coxwell gets nary a mention here, as new world cinema must require a female lead or co-lead for every filmmaker not named Martin Scorsese. So, to heck with history, Amelia Wren is now the hero of this adventure!As it turns out, Ms. Jones' character is the more interesting of the two. Amelia's initial showmanship catches nerdy Glaisher off-guard, though in fact, both are over-compensating. He, for his inferiority complex and the ridicule he endures from his fellow brainiacs at the Royal Society of London, and she for the tragic loss of her beloved husband in a balloon mishap. The mismatched pair are on a mission to fly higher than any human has previously flown, and in the process, allow Glaisher to record all the atmospheric readings possible in order to prove to the skeptics that meteorology is legitimate, and the weather can be predicted (although almost 160 years later, most weather reporters still haven't quite gotten the hang of it).It's a tricky thing filming two characters who spend most of the movie floating tens of thousands of feet above ground in a wicker basket. The banter between the two should be crisp and the connection or disconnect should add intrigue. Here, the two characters are dwarfed by the giant balloon and the challenges that brings. What begins as an adventure morphs into a tale of survival. Storms, frostbite and technical issues provide the conflict. We do have flashbacks to background on both Amelia and Glaisher. Himesh Patel (star of this year's YESTERDAY) plays Glaisher's best friend, while Tom Courtenay and Anne Reid are Glaisher's parents. Vincent Perez appears as Amelia's husband Pierre.I was fortunate enough to see this in a theatre and the big screen allows for the balloon effects to have full impact. There is no doubt that streaming this on your TV will not be as impressive ... although anyone suffering from acrophobia will likely still experience some discomfort. The scenes in the balloon are thrilling, and Amelia's rescue mission up the ropes is stunning and beautifully filmed by cinematographer George Steel; however, the flashback scenes are quick to deflate the excitement. The upside here is that the English really did break the French record on the flight ... even if the filmmaker had to bend history so Amelia could get credit."
"You might feel really cold just by watching. Some parts i had to close my eyes. Can you imagine being so brave to risk your life and climb. I cannot. What gives people that bravery. Supposedly this is true story of the guy, not the girl."
"Redmayne again plays a real-life scientist: meteorologist James Glaisher, intent on proving it's possible to predict the weather if one can get high enough to take readings of the atmosphere. Which is where Jones' fictional aeronaut Amelia Wren and her hot-air balloon comes in. At first, she refuses to help The Aeronauts follows every rule of screenwriting as rigorously as Glaisher checks his instruments and logs the results - but it's not long before the mismatched pair (he's a sombre fusspot, she's a dazzling showwoman) soar up, up and away to meet-cute at 20,000ft. The Aeronauts begins with Glaisher (who in real life conducted the flight with colleague Henry Coxwell) and Wren clambering into the basket to rise above a cheering, waving crowd. We're treated to some stunning aerial views of the River Thames snaking through smoke-stacked London before the first of several flashbacks fills in the backstory. It's standard stuff (pompous peers, personal trauma) and you can almost hear the fingers of screenwriter Jack Thorne (His Dark Materials) tapping the keyboard as he metes out each revelation for maximum impact. But when the action cuts back to the balloon rising higher and higher, the excitement likewise ratchets: lightning forks through black, roiling clouds that finally drop away to reveal a blue and breathless sky; a swarm of yellow butterflies engulf our gawping heroes at 17,000 feet; the equipment cakes dangerously with ice; far below, the clouds stretch out like snowscapes as far as the eye can see; and the glimmering stars descend until they can almost be touched. It all makes for a journey that's close to being as visually dazzling as the one taken by Brad Pitt in Ad Astra, meaning each of those earthbound flashbacks act as sandbags you'll wish you could cast over the side. The kind of film that critics like to describe as 'handsomely mounted', The Aeronauts also sees Harper (Wild Rose, Peaky Blinders) offer up several action sequences that fall somewhere between surprisingly robust and faintly ludicrous. Similarly, the film lands between two stools, gliding into awards-baiting territory one minute and accelerating to become Fast & Furious: The Victorian Years the next. It makes for a somewhat bumpy ride, but one worth taking."
"Meteorologist Redmayne needs a hot air balloon to help prove that predicting the weather is possible. He seeks out Jones who has one and they set off on a trip to go higher than anyone has gone before.The double act of Redmayne and Jones works well and it's an intriguing tale with much to enjoy. The best bits are undoubtedly in the journey itself which is often exciting and breathtaking as well as beautiful. The flashbacks which show how they got to where they are - Royal Society's mocking of Redmayne / Jones' previous marriage are actually a bit boring, but overall, particularly after the first hour, it is certainly enjoyable."
Good photography and aerial views of London but ground based outside shots evoke 'The greatest showman'. Essentially it felt like a remake of Gravity transplanted from space to the sky over London. Mildly entertaining but no classic
"In this action, adventure, biography film directed by Tom Harper (Wild Rose, TVs Peaky Blinders) and written by Harper and Jack Thorne (Wonder, TVs National Treasure), Felicity Jones (The Theory of Everything, Rogue One: A Star Wars Story) stars as daredevil pilot Amelia Wren and Eddie Redmayne (The Danish Girl, The Theory of Everything) scientist James Glaisher. It also features an excellent score The Aeronauts Waltz by Jack Arnold (Wild Rose, Albatross). In 1862 the pair teamed up to advance human knowledge of the weather and fly higher than anyone in history. Facing physical and emotional challenges in the thin air, the unlikely duo find their place in the world.Glaisher's friend John Trew is played by Himesh Patel (Yesterday, TVs Eastenders) who I felt was underused in the film, as were many others including Tim McInnery (Notting Hill, Eddie the Eagle) one of the academics who band together to try and foil Glaisher's plan and Robert Glenister (Live by Night, TVs Paranoid) who is far too brief a player.The main action focuses around the flight, from the take off where Wren plays to the gathered crowd, including dropping her dog from the balloon, and the perils of hypothermia and other physical hazards. As a viewer, I really felt that I lived the journey with them, the ups, the downs and the threats to life as I willed them to both achieve their objectives and survive. My husband did this even more so, as it turns out he has a problem with heights as seen from a hot air balloon in a film - I don't think I will ever buy him a gift of a flight in real life - as he spent most of the movie feeling like he himself was in jeopardy.There are two sub-plots, one around Wren's fellow pilot and deceased husband Pierre Rennes (Queen of the Damned, Cyrano de Bergerac) and the other, Glaisher's relationship with his father Arthur (Tom Courtenay: Doctor Zhivago, Let Him Have It) who is slipping into the clutches of dementia, which I found particularly moving.Although I enjoyed the film, there were two problems for me, I understand that to lose height they had to jettison all of the equipment but one: how dangerous is this for anyone who happens to be on the ground when all of it lands and two, why did Wren not undertake this technique when she was on the journey with her husband? I presume we are to assume that the flight is over water or unoccupied land (they land in what appears to be a wooded field) and that only Glaisher had the solution to this scientific dilemma. But for me it spoiled what was otherwise a great action film. I know a lot of other reviewers have difficulties with the historical inconsistancies, but when a film informs me it is inspired by a true adventure I feel it asks me to supsend belief in facts in order to enhance the viewing pleasure. Yes, it would have been nice to be historically accurate, but would it have been as much fun? For me the feisty heroine and intense adventure was enough.7/10"
